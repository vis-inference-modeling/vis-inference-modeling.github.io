      "comment info": "1.  The rate of wind and solar have been becoming higher since 2000, but fossil fuels occupies more than half of materials. In fact, the situation is seen as a problem, so the governments of various countries are promoting renewable energy. I had an opportunity to think about a solution to improve the situations when I was a junior high school student. \n2. I wonder why the electric power generation in the world decreased in around 2008 and 2021. I think that the Lehman shock in 2008 and the spreading of coronavirus relate to the result. Indeed, the economy was in a slump because of them, so demand of electric power generation decreased. \n3. If the rate of fossil fuels remains steady, the global warming and the air pollution will worsen. So, the precious natural environment in Akita, where I live, could be negatively affected. For instance, the growth of Akita cedars may deteriorate. \n4. Catchy headline : What is the Solution to Increase the Rate of Clean Energy?",

      "comment info": "Overall, electricity generation has increased over time. While the use of clean energy sources globally has grown over the last 20 years, the use of fossil fuels has been consistently higher. Coal and gas are the most popular sources, and wind/solar power has experienced the most growth recently. \n\nI wonder why, even with the proliferation of new ways to generate electricity, the use of gas and coal has steadily increased. It must have something to do with the accessibility of the resources, but I wonder how much the growth of global population effects how electricity is generated. I wonder how greatly these statistics vary from country to country. \n\nCanvassing for the local democratic campaign, I noticed that clean energy was a very important issue. Everyone is impacted by the negative effects brought about by climate change, which the expenditure of fossil fuels has been proven to greatly contribute to global warming. \n\nGood Ole’ Coal: It’s Electric!",

Additionally, there are tiered color blocks on the graph that each symbolize a different fuel for electricity. Another point is that the yellow-orange colored blocks are made of a cleaner fuel alternative and the black-gray blacks represent fossil fuel-based electricity options. Something that I wonder is how much a gigawatt is and what the best thing to compare it to would be in order to comprehend the size of it better. Another thing I wonder is what some of the differences between clean and fossil-based electricity are. This data affects the community around me because fossil fuels are a large contributor to climate change so it is important to see how much energy we are basing on fossil fuels versus cleaner fuel options.

We noticed that it displayed the types and amounts of energy used throughout the world as a whole from 2000 to the 2020s. There were also separate graphs that specifically documented the energy usage of the United States, China, and India over the same time period. We noted that the overall energy usage worldwide for all types is going up, and that nuclear is the most prominent energy source while coal is the least prominent. We also noticed that there were “dips” in worldwide energy usage around 2008 and 2020, which probably correspond with the economic hardships caused by the 2008 housing crisis and the coronavirus pandemic. \n\n \n\nWe wonder what the data looked like before 2000, as “clean” energy seems to be a relatively new phenomenon. We also wonder why India’s energy usage is so low when compared to the United States and China.\n\n \n\nThis topic is important because we all use energy every day, and it is useful to know the main types of energy being used. It also gives more insight into how different countries operate.\n\n \n\nOur title for the graph is “Ember’s Evaluation of the Evolution of Electricity.”",

Of the forms of electricity generation, clean energy produces the most, with nuclear and hydroelectric electricity taking the #1 and #2 spots. Among fossil fuels, oil and gas produce the most electricity, but not nearly as much as clean forms of energy such as in nuclear or hydroelectric forms. \n\nI wonder how the total electricity generated for each form of generation depends on the energy production of each country. China seems to be on the rise and most likely will still continue generating more and more electricity, with a high emphasis on fossil fuels. The USA has remained rather constant, and is interesting because there seems to be a downtrend in fossil fuels. Could this be because they source fossil fuels from other countries?\n\nI live in the USA, and so the graph showing the forms of electrical generation in the US is interesting to me. It shows that gas has been becoming the main source of electrical power for the US, as well as coal. Clean forms of energy generation like solar power have only contributed a speck to the total energy production, despite it being made a huge deal nowadays.\n\nHeadline:\nEnergy Evolution: Transitioning from Fossil Fuels to Clean Sources",

China produces the more energy than the US, with India producing less than both.\nI wonder why India produces so much less energy than China despite the vast population living in both countries. Maybe China is more urbanized and industrialized than India. I also find it interesting that the United States has a small amount of people compared to both China and India, yet produces so much energy.\nAs someone who lives on Earth during the current climate crisis, it is somewhat relieving to see the amount of clean energy being produced.

I notice that there are more gigawatt hours of fossil electricity such as gas, oil, and coal than clean electricity. This is expected given the global warming crisis that we are currently facing as a result of these fossil fuels being emitted into the air in order to generate electricity. However, I also noticed that clean energy has significantly increased since 2000, especially wind and solar electricity which faced a significant increase. As climate change has become a more real and pressing issue over the past couple of years, there has been a bigger push to use renewable energy such as putting solar panels on your roof. The more specific graphs demonstrate electric generation in countries like China, India, and the U.S. I noticed that China used significantly more electricity than India even though they have the same population. China also generates most of its electricity through coal. This makes sense considering how industrialized China is and how many factories it needs to upkeep. I can infer this is why China has such bad air quality and pollution. The graph of the U.S. concerns me because while our population is much less than India's, we still use more electricity than them. I wonder what other innovations we will develop to limit fossil electricity generation.\n\"The Future is Clean!\"",

I additionally noticed that even over time, coal and gas, both very harmful to the environment, are still the most used. I wonder if gas and coal are more affordable, in comparison to clean electricity. In regards to the second group of graphs, I noticed all three countries given have very different graphs. China's graph shows a very steep increase in electricity generation. The United States graph displays a consistent generation of both fossil and clean electricity. India's graph shows very little generation of electricity at all. I wonder if the generation of electricity is affected by the country's economy or level of technological advancement. All three of these countries are all very populated, so that could be why they all still rely on fossil fuels. This relates to me and my community, as it is important to acknowledge the need for clean energy to preserve our environment. \"Clean Countries or Coal Countries\"",

I noted that, as the graphs of China, India, and the US demonstrate, this increase is not necessarily uniform across all nations. China's electrical production expanded year after year between 2000 and 2020 at a high linear pace, while the US increased only slightly throughout that time. I can also see that each nation uses coal as its main source of electricity generation, but over time, the US has been using less of it while the other two have both been using more. \n\n I wonder how the United States has managed to maintain steady electricity generation in spite of economic and population growth. Although China has a much greater population, the huge difference in electrical generation is still confusing. This raises the question of whether environmental laws and regulations are in force in nations other than the United States.\n\n\nThis relates to my town since switching to renewable energy offers many advantages, especially in terms of lowering air pollution and enhancing general health for a large number of people.\n\nHow do China, the U.S., and India generate their electricity?",

In addition, since 2000, the amount of electricity generated worldwide has increased, with a rise from 5 to 15 million GWH in the use of clean energy.China consumes a significant amount of electricity globally, mostly from coal, and this consumption is still growing, while US electricity consumption has been relatively stable. I wonder why do the US and China have such differing overall energy usage? Why is the US's production staying steady over the past 20 years while China's is increasing so quickly? I also wonder how much more expensive it is to produce electricity from clean sources compared to fossil fuels?This affects my community because it would be better for everyone  if we continue to use clean energy sources over fossil fuels. In addition, clean energy sources are more sustainable and efficient than the current coal-based electricity system because they generate a greater quantity of electricity over a longer period of time.\n\nCatchy headline: Watt a Way to Save the Environment",

      "comment info": "The graph depicts the world electricity generation, which has been increasing since 2000. In the past 20 years, the usage of clean energy has increased significantly. China uses a great deal of energy, most of which comes from coal. However, since 2000, China has increased their usage of clean power. Conversely, India has used much less energy. In 2020, they used around 2 million gigawatt hours of electricity. I found this surprising, as India is a heavily populated country. But, I wonder if the poverty in India may have impacted the results of this graph. This relates to my community because fossil fuels are harmful to the environment. Through this graph, we can see that countries like China are using a large amount of fossil fuels. It is important that nations around the world try to shift towards cleaner energy.

      "comment info": "In the world graph I noticed that fossil fuels remain as the source that generates the most amount of electricity from 2000-2020. The electricity generation has increased slightly for gas and coal. However, the electricity generation remained generally the same for nuclear energy at about 2 million gigawatt hours and hydroelectric sources at producing about 5 million gigawatt hours. Oil and other sources have remained constant as well at around 1 million gigawatt hours. I also noticed that the generation of electricity for wind and solar has greatly increased. From 2000-2o10 wind and solar were barely used to produce electricity, but there has been a steady rise to about 4 million gigawatt hours in 2020. Furthermore, for the country totals graphs, I noticed that the use of coal has increased in China and India, but has decreased in the United States. I wonder how the data will change once countries start to come closer to their climate change goals (will there truly be an increase in generation of electricity from clean energy than with fossil fuels?) I wonder what the data would be prior to 2000? Why is the United States more steady in electricity generation from 2000-2020 in comparison to China and India? This relates to my community because whether the United States generates electricity with clean power or fossil fuels will impact the economy and economic development. \n\n“Shocking News: Coal Remains as the Top Producer of Energy in the World”",

I wonder if any of these resources will ever run out and we won’t have any resources to rely on anymore. Nuclear energy has always been high but it has climaxed.  Coal has been steady throughout the past 20 years though. In the 4charts it seems that China uses the most energy and surprisingly Chins uses more energy than the United states. I already know that India is going to have the lowest in resources because they have to reserve theirs because it is limited.",

Moreover, China and the United States have a large portion of their energy coming from clean sources while India basically gets all their energy from fossil fuels.\n\nWhat do you wonder? What are you curious about that comes from what you notice in the graphs? \nWhy is China using more energy compared to India when both of these countries have a very similar population size is it because China is still a developing country?\n\nWhat impact does this topic have on you and your community?\nThis topic impacts our community because it emphasizes the importance of clean renewable energy. By looking at the graphs we can say that the globe is moving towards clean energy, although fossil fuels seem to be the main source of energy. This is important because it suggests that we are working to combat global issues such as climate change. Furthermore, it will encourage people to be thoughtful about their carbon footprint.\nOn the graph,  US reliance on fossil fuels decreases as the years go by.

Additionally, China uses some of the most electricity in the world, especially with coal , and it keeps increasing, whereas American has stayed pretty steady. What I wonder is why wind, solar, oil, and others are used less the nuclear or hydroelectric.  What's going on in this graph is it is trying to show people how the clean and fossil fuel energy is being used around the world and how many hours are being put in for each type of energy. This effects my community because we want more clean electricity generation being used rather then fossil fuels because it is better for the environment and more hours of that electricity is better., rather then how coal is being used right now.

I also notice that China had a dramatic increase in electricity use, though the use of coal (a fossil fuel) is the predominant source of power. In contrast, the United States has used less coal since 2000 (2 to 0.4 million GWh). India has generated far less electricity than China or the US--- only around 2 million GWh in 2020.\n\nI wonder why world electricity generation has become increasingly clean. Is it due to international legislation, or because the cleaner resources have become cheaper? I also wonder if the electricity generation in China is increasing because they are a developing nation. I am very surprised that India has such low electricity generation being such a large nation, but I am curious if China's graph was similar prior to 2000.\n\nThis relates to me and my community because electricity generation will either pollute or conserve the environment. Fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal spur environmental degradation. Therefore, it is important that world electricity generation becomes increasingly clean so that increased worldwide development does not make climate change worse.\n\n\"CURRENT News: World Electricity Generation Changes\"",

Overall, the first graph shows the huge amount of energy consumed across the globe. Energy consumption seems to be on a rapidly rising trend, and although it does not show up to 2024, I am sure the trend will continue upward. I was shocked at how low India's consumption was considering the huge number of people they have. India is more populated than the US and uses significantly less energy. China is similar in population to India but uses so much more energy. I was also surprised that nuclear energy is clean energy. I feel that the only things I hear regarding the word 'nuclear' are negative, so it is surprising that it is associated with something I think of as good and helpful like clean energy. I would title these graphs \"Energy Consumption: Where does your country fall?\"",

Hint:  India’s reason has to do with standard of living.  China’s reason has to do with industrialization.  Both have to do with availability of sources of energy.\n\nWhy is nuclear considered “clean?”  What do we mean by “clean” energy?  If we close down nuclear facilities, what will replace them with?

The first graph displays the world electricity in the clean category: nuclear, hydroelectric and other, wind, solar and the fossil category oil, gas, and coal from years 2000 to 2020. I noticed there was a large increase in the use of cleaner energy and fossil fuels in recent years. I wonder how those environmentalists or those who care about the environment feel about the increased use of fossil fuel emissions and how that affects the environment. Does using clean energy help? The second graph below depicts the total electricity generation graphs for China, the U.S. and India with the year range of 2000 to 2020. I notice that China produces the most coal and India produces the least. I wonder why China produces more fossil fuels than the US and India and how that affects the environment and pollution. I wonder if population has an affect on the mass production of fossil fuels in China and India's because the current population in both of those countries about 1.4 billion each. With the same population you would think they would produce the same amount of fuel. This relates to me and my community as my dad owns an electric car which is environmental friendly and I have been more aware of how much fuel and gas costs affect the world around me. \n\nTitle: Gasolina",

I noticed that for every type of fuel, there was a general increase in the amount of gigawatt hours of electricity generated over time. I wonder if this is due to advancements in technology for each type of energy source. Also, I noticed that for all 20 years, the clean energy sources had the highest electricity generation with nuclear being the highest reaching over 25 million gigawatt hours in 2020. Out of the clean energy sources, I noticed that wind and solar energy had the lowest electricity generation, and I wonder if this is because they are not as reliable sources as something like nuclear energy since they depend on the weather. Additionally, I noticed that coal had the lowest world electricity generation out of both fossil fuels and all types of fuels, approximating 8 million gigawatt hours around the year 2020. I wonder if it had such low gigawatt hours compared to other sources because it has become less and less popular over the years due to its harmful environmental risks. This relates to my community because I have noticed a greater implementation of clean, renewable energy sources as climate change has become a greater issue.

China and the U.S. produce the most energy, while China and India have the greatest demand for it. I also noticed that China and India rely most heavily on energy produced by coal, while the U.S. is primarily oil and nuclear. I wondered why that is. I presume it is because coal is cheap so it is more affordable for China and India to produce energy for such large populations. An additional thought comes to my mind as well. Why does the U.S. go almost fully nuclear, and build more nuclear plants around the country. It is currently the largest energy producer while also being the cleanest. China, for example, has begun construction of 22 power plants, so why don't we construct more? With the overall cost of living increasing everywhere, it would be more beneficial for the U.S. to construct more nuclear power plants to provide cheaper electricity.",

      "comment info": "This graph charts the source of the world’s electricity supply based on the method of its production--that is, whether the electricity was produced via fossil fuel consumption in the form of oil, gas, and coal; or, if clean sources like hydroelectric, wind, solar, and nuclear power were used in production. The lion’s share of global power production, as the graph indicates, originates in the burning of coal, and, more broadly, other fossil fuels. This is despite an evident recent uptick in reliance on clean energy sources, perhaps spurred on by recent ecocentric movements and such measures as the Paris Accords. Indeed, the pressures to which such a move responds seem pressing, so much so that the global predominance of coal energy sources--which produce the greatest amount of and therefore most harmful greenhouse emissions--incites no little concern. This concerning trend finds further grounding in the subsequent graphs included below, wherein the global energy consumption is broken apart into a few constituent countries’. The graph evinces that China, one of the world’s foremost economic and industrial superpowers, remains largely dependent on coal energy for its massive energy consumption, around twice that of the United States. The unfortunate truth of such statistics is that overreliance on coal does not only affect the country producing it, but has devastating environmental ramifications for the entire world.",

Additionally, more clean energy is being used as the world changes rather than using fossil fuels. Looking at the three smaller graphs, I notice that each graph contains vastly different amounts of energy use. For reference, India has the least usage while China uses the most.  I wonder why they change what energy is used throughout the years. I also wonder about ways we can lessen the energy consumption to have a decrease in statistics. Lastly I think about the last 3 graphs and how we can even achieve those rates. Even how those rates came to be would be beneficial to analyze a deeper look into how electricity is generated.\nThis relates to me and my community because we all generate electricity and this in turn consumes energy. This is not to say that energy should not be used at all, but especially fossil fuels can be harmful. In order to do this, there would need to be some sort of intervention. If my community does not begin to reduce their energy consumption, the world will not change for the better. I do not think that it is a matter of one energy being better than another, it has been made common sense that clean energy is, but overall reducing our usage will better support the earth than replacing energy sources. It is a start, but there still can be improvements made.\n\nNew Global Data on how Electricity is Generated- How will it affect our kids in the future?",

China has jumped from under 2 million to over 8 million gigawatt hours in 20 years. The United States has stayed relatively the same with 4 million gigawatt hours in a span of 20 years. India on the other hand has had the smallest increase, but still less than the United States. India has grown more in fossil fuels than clean power, with a growth of 2 million in the past 20 years. This to me is a bit surprising because India's population is greater than both the United States and China. Compared to China, India has over 16.4 million more than the population of China and their use of power is significantly less.  This might relate to my community because there should probably be more of an increase of the use of clean power, but it also shows the slight decrease of fossil fuels so that is comforting for the upcoming years.",

It's also extremely interesting to me how India has such a large population but uses very little energy compared to China and the U.S, and I wonder why that is. India also has continued to use mainly fossil fuels for energy, while China and the U.S seem to be using more renewable resources as time goes on.

I wonder what it would take to get there though because countries like China have such large amounts of fossil electricity. I think this can relate to money. Like in countries like China, some people have a lot of money and are very wealthy but misuse that money. China is granted large amounts of electricity but still uses a lot of unclean sources.

In the universal graph, I notice that there is a definite spike in the use of clean energy, which is probably due to growing environmental awareness and research. In the graph depicting China's energy use, it seems that although clean fuel is increasing, fossil fuels are too, and to a much larger extent, especially with the use of coal. The United States seems to be significantly improving on their use of fossil fuels. I notice that India uses very little energy at all. I wonder why this is, especially since India is an extremely large country with a large population. This relates to me and my community because if we don't start caring for our planet more, we will have a much dirtier and unhealthy world to live in and leave for future generations.

Those resources being shown include nuclear, gas, coal, wind, solar, oil, hydroelectric, and others. The second graph shows how much of those resources are being used in various countries. Overall, the world has seen a steady increase in the use of the noted resources to power electricity.  Mostly so in nuclear power which was used around 15 million gigawatt hours in 2000 and jumped to surpassing 25 million gigawatt hours in 2020. Out of the country graphs, China is seen to have the biggest jump in use. Nuclear alone jumped over 8 million gigawatt hours in 20 years. India has the slowest incline while America has remained rather stagnant in the amount of resources and energy being produced since 2000. I wonder why America has not seen a drastic increase in the use of resources the way countries like China have. I wonder if there will be a noticeable increase in oil use with the Willow Project being pursued. This relates to my community because we are all affected by the different uses of electrical power. Both clean power and fossil fuels have their pros and cons for communities. For example, clean power is better for the environment but can be less efficient and more cost-effective. Not every community has the privilege of being able to use better, cleaner energy sources. \n\n“What Lights Up The World? Our Energy Sources Since the 2000s”",

The learner enemies of Nuclear, hydroelectric, and wind/solar are used far less. I wonder how the unclean sources are still the majority when climate change and environmental health have been such prevalent topics of conversation for years. While it was expected that fossil fuels would still be used more, It is surprising that they still dominate as the main sources of energy. There has been a large upsurge in the interests of the environment, hence the amount of energy produced by clean materials should be rising as years pass. This relates to every community because the health of the planet is the most important thing in preserving the health of the people. We need to care for our environment because it is our only home. It is my hope that change continues to push the use of fossil fuels down. A possible title is “Clean v Fossil; Who’s in Charge?”",

The thing that immediately stands out is the increase over time for the Wind and Solar section across the past decade. Also while coal is also increasing, it is noticeably slower than the increase in Wind and Solar. Looking at the country graphs, what stood out to me was the U.S.'s apparent stagnation in overall production of energy when compared to India and China. This is also combined with a marked reduction in Coal production which is in stark contrast to China which seems to have not slowed down on their coal energy production. \nI wonder why the US and China have such different overall energy profiles. Why is China's production rising at such a rapid rate while the US's has been stable for the past 2 decades?\nThis is significant to my community because how our electricity is produced directly affects our lives. Cleaner energy production means cleaner air which is overall better for human health. Also, in my area there are currently questions regarding a nuclear power plant that is reaching its EOL. Whether or not it's shut down might affect things like energy prices locally but also contributes to the overall landscape of energy production in the US.\nTitle: \"Global Electricity Production Continues to Rise\"",

What I notice about China's graph in particular is that it's electricity production has been on the rise, along with its use of coal and gas. The United States' electricity production is the opposite; its electricity production slightly increased while its use of Coal has significantly decreased. India's electricity production, while on the rise, still relies overwhelmingly on coal, and produces less than a quarter of the electricity China produces, despite having similar populations. \nI wonder why China's use of hydroelectric makes up the majority of its clean energy, while nuclear makes up the majority of the United States' energy. I wonder if the difference is due to the country's philosophies regarding these two power sources, or if its due to the different geography of each country. \nThe increasing trend of emitting less carbon emissions relates to our community since a decrease in carbon emissions could slow down the effects of climate change. Although the world produces more electricity, the United States has seen a reduction in the use of coal, while China has seen an increase in clean energy production.\nTwo titles I suggest would be \"Electricity Production Stabilizes in the U.S.\", or \"Electricity Production on the Rise Around the Globe.\"",

      "comment info": "The first thing that popped out to me about these graphs was the sheer amount of energy generation produced by China. In just the coal industry, China uses more energy than the US uses in all industries combined. Another thing that interested me was the steady proportion of nuclear energy throughout the years. Nuclear power has gone through many recent developments making it extremely less dangerous for the environment, but those advancements aren't reflected in its usage. With issues such as clean energy, I wonder how strongly connotations surrounding certain types of energy effect their usage on large scales. Wind and solar energy appears to be the \"least\" clean form of clean energy according to the graphs, but among the three main types of clean energy, it is the only form that has seen a large increase in usage over time. Though it could also be due to the fact that nuclear and hydroelectric plants both require large amounts of space and infrastructure in order to construct and maintain. \nBeing informed about this information is very important because of the prevalence of energy discussions. Hearing debates and making conclusions from there is an incomplete way of developing a strategy for energy moving forward. By seeing how much each country relies on each form of energy, you are better equipped to talk about how those infrastructures could be changed to better the world going forward.\nTitle: How the US has Moved Away from Coal Energy.",

      "comment info": "Immediately, I noticed how a stacked area chart is being utilized to visualize the data presented. The issue with using a stacked area chart like these graphs is that it is difficult to determine the actual size of one section in the chart since each section is built on top of one another like layers of sediment. This also makes it difficult to visually see trends in specific sections since their baselines are all different and affected by the layers below. I also noticed how it appears clean energy sources have increased in the past 22 years, specifically how much wind and solar have exploded recently. \nI wonder how the U.S. has stayed fairly consistent with energy production when it feels as if electricity has become more and more integral to life each day in the twenty-first century. Similarly, on the opposite side, why has China’s production boomed so much?\nThese graphs relate to me and my community because as climate change continues and natural fossil fuels begin to run out, the need for sustainable energy sources and better energy consumption practices is more important than ever. Keeping energy use steady, or even decreasing is something that we as a community should strive for. Additionally, by making sure we continue to switch more and more to clean energy production, we are helping the prosperity and longevity of the planet and our own futures. \nTitle: “A Decade of the World’s Energy: Is Clean Power the Future?”",

In recent years, there's been a large global push towards clean energy in response to severe climate change, but these global trends don't appear whatsoever in China. In fact, the total coal usage from China is more than the total energy usage in the US. This makes sense from a population stand point, but looking at the graphs with that perspective makes me wonder why India's total energy usage is so low compared to China and the US, especially when the population of India is about the same as the population of China, which is much larger than the US. These graphs also make me wonder about how effective global initiatives can really be if there are still large nations not meeting the regulations designed to help clean our planet.\nUnderstanding how our nation produces the energy that we've grown to rely on helps contextualize issues regarding our energy grid. Ideas of severely reducing one form of energy versus another need to be backed by the knowledge of how we are currently relying on that energy. Simply making decisions or forming ideas without knowledge of the implications will lead to ignorant and damaging decisions.\nFor a title of the graphs, you could use \n\"What Powers the People?

It is evident that more electricity is being generated now compared to 20 years ago.

      "comment info": "When analyzing the graphs depicting total electricity generation in China, the United States, and India, China immediately captured my attention. This is because it displays a tremendous increase in electricity generated in a short amount of time (only about 20 years). This is vastly different from the graph of the United States, which reveals a relatively stable trend in electricity generated. India on the other hand, has the lowest amount of electricity generated, and not only that, but most of their electricity is generated from fossil fuels, instead of clean power sources. The initial graph displaying the global levels of electricity generation indicates that there has been a steady increase over time, accompanied by a noticeable shift towards increased utilization of clean energy sources.\nSomething I wonder is if China and India both have similar populations, why is China's electricity usage about 4 times larger than India's? I also wonder how the United States electricity usage has remained so consistent throughout the years, even though we have had many new inventions/resources that require an immense amount of power.\nThe fact that still over half of our electricity production is coming from fossil fuels, is a bit concerning due to the fact of their many harmful impacts on Earth. I know switching to cleaner forms of electricity can be more expensive, but they are overall better for our planet.\nTitle: \"Powering the World: Electricity Generation Over the Last 20 Years\"",

Gas, wind and solar, and other renewables have been steadily increasing since 2000. Nuclear and hydro have stayed relatively flat over the 20 year period. Fossil fuels (coal, gas, oil) still make up the vast majority of electricity generation compared to clean sources.\n\nWhat I wonder:\nHow much have total global electricity generation amounts changed over this period? The graph shows share but not absolute amounts. What explains the slight dip in coal around 2020 - was it due to the pandemic reducing energy demand? How much variability is there between countries and regions in the electricity source mix? How are these trends projected to change in the coming decades as renewables scale up further?\n\nImpact on me and my community:\nThe still-dominant share of fossil fuels has major climate change and air pollution impacts that affect the whole world. More renewables means cleaner air and reduced emissions, but also potential economic disruption in fossil-dependent communities. The trends point to the need to massively scale up clean energy investment and infrastructure in my community and globally.\n\nHeadline: \"Coal still king as renewables rise in powering the world\"",

When looking at particular countries, in China it is constantly growing, with the U.S. having a rather constant electricity generation and a rather slow increase in India. \n\n2) How do China's, the U.S.'s, and India's societies contrast each other considering their electricity generation?  May there be a decrease in fossil fuels and more clean power in years to come? \n\n3) As electricity generation only seems to generally increase, while fossil fuels seem to be the main sources, there are also cleaner options.

This means that per person, we use more than twice the amount of energy than China does. This only true for the most recent years too, as in earlier parts of the graph our energy usage per person is even greater compared to China's.\nAnother thing I noticed was how the type of energy the United States uses changed. We can see a gradual increase in both oil and wind and solar starting around 2010, with a decrease in coal around that same time. While it is good that  the United States is using more wind/solar energy and using less coal energy, I wonder if that will be offset by the increased usage in oil. These shifts in the graph are something that I can connect back to own community. My hometown is a suburban area in California, where over the past 10 years I have observed many households add solar panels to their houses, including my own. So that increase in the graph I can definitely reflect. However, on the other hand, the suburban landscape also dictates the necessitiy for a car, which increases the use of oil. So that is something in the graph that I can also unfortunately reflect in my hometown. What this graph should tell us is that we should limit our oil use, whether it's walking to places or using public transit.

      "comment info": "First examining the “World electricity generation” graph demonstrates an evident increase in electricity generation with fossil fuels dominating a majority of the sources of that energy. Of the clean energy, it’s interesting to note that hydroelectric and other is the greatest source of clean energy compared to nuclear and wind/solar. Of the fossil fuels, coal is the greatest source of fossil fuels compared to gas and oil (and other). Another intriguing thing to note is that clean energy seems to be increasing faster than fossil fuels, however, with clean energy sources taking a bigger share of the total world electricity generation as time passes. I wonder how this increase in clean energy will affect the countries’ totals since China seems to follow that trend of clean energy’s greater share of the world total, but the United States’s and India’s totals seem to be changing at slower rates than China’s. With the rise of clean energy, I hope that statistics like these cause us to reflect on how our communities and we use electricity and where our electricity is coming from. I strongly hope there are more talks especially regarding sustainability when it comes to unrenewable sources of energy such as fossil fuels.

Fossil fuels surpassed 15 million gigawatt hours and renewable sources of power present a positive increase that surpassed 25 million gigawatt hours. Countries like China, the U.S., and India differ in the amount of electricity generation used, the U.S. demonstrates leisurely decreasing its use of fossil fuels while slightly increasing the use of renewable power sources. As China uses the most clean energy out of the U.S. and India they also use a large mass of fossil fuels.

This means that the average energy usage per person in the US is significantly greater than China's and especially India's. I then noticed the change in the type of energy the United States' has used over the years. From 2000 to 2020 there seems to be a decrease in coal, an small but noticeable increase in wind and solar, and then an increase in oil. So while the increased use of the clean wind and solar energy, and the decrease of coal energy looks good, I wonder if it is offset by the dramatic increase in oil. \nAs the graph depicts energy usage from 2000 to 2020, I am able to observe if me and my family's energy usage coorelates with the graph. Over the last 20 years many families in my neighborhood, including my own, added solar panels to their roofs, this lines up fairly accurately with when solar and wind power starts to increase (around 2010). I am glad to see this change, however I unfortunately also observe that with the layout of my suburban town, driving is almost essential to go to places so seeing an increase in oil also makes sense. These graphs should encourage people to cut out oil, if they need to go somewhere close and walking/biking is a feasible means of travel then they should consider that instead.

In differentiating between clean sources and fossil fuels, clean sources seem to be much more prevalent in use than fossil fuels, which is a positive consequence. Diving even further into detail, I noticed that the United States has a much more gradual increase in electricity generation than that of China, which has a much steeper slope and more rapid increase in electricity generation.\nI wonder why exactly China's electricity generation has increased so much faster than that of the United States. Both China and the United States are massive centers of economic and industrial growth, so it is interesting that China's change in electricity generation is far more drastic than the United States.\nEnergy sources have a huge impact on me and my surrounding community. It is highly important that we steer away from using fossil fuels as an energy source, as they are detrimental to the environment and the world that we live in, and create more sources of clean energy. The United States' electricity generation increasing at a much slower rate is both good and bad for my community- good in the sense that less fossil fuels are being used, bad in the sense that less clean energy is used.

      "comment info": "I noticed that worldwide clean electricity sources such as nuclear, wind, solar, and hydroelectric have experienced a greater increase in output of electricity over time compared to fossil fuels. When examining the individual countries' graphs we can see that, for the United States specifically, clean electricity sources have only experienced a relatively slight increase over time. Meanwhile, the United States’ coal usage is the only source that experienced a decrease in generation. \nI am curious as to why the US is less reliant on coal, if it has something to do with the cost of mining coal, or if the US is choosing to prioritize investing in clean sources instead. If the US is in fact choosing to spend more on clean sources of electricity this would mean, policymakers are becoming more conscious of the need to take steps to protect the environment so our planet can be habitable for the next generation. I would title this graph: “Electricity Generation for our Next Generation”.",

I noticed that this increase isn’t necessarily equal amongst all countries as seen in the graphs of India, China, and the United States. China’s electrical production has grown at a high linear rate every year from 2000 to 2020, while the United States has only slightly grown over the 20 year time span. I also notice that each country’s main source of electrical generation is coal, but the United States has been decreasing coal use over time while the other two countries both have been increasing theirs. \n\nI wonder how the United States has been able to keep their electrical generation steady while growing in population and economically, but China’s has grown by almost four times. Of course China’s population is much greater but the large discrepancy in electrical generation is puzzling. This leads me to wonder if other countries outside the United States have environmental laws and acts put in place.\n\nI live in California and this relates to my community because we are constantly passing new laws to preserve the environment and eliminate the use of fossil fuels. I have lots of family in India, and that community is being affected by the fossil fuels being burned, changing the climate. Farmers in India have been forced to move from their hometowns because of climate change and resources have been scarce.\n\n“Electrical Generation: Why Nuclear is Good, For Once.”",

I also wonder if the growing movement to protect the environment has had any effect, as more and more people are realizing how much these fossil fuels harm the planet.

China's generation alone accounts for about 8 million GWh, with India accounting for about 1 million GWh. Furthermore, we see that worldwide nuclear generation has barely moved at all, while hydroelectric looks like it's about doubled. Wind and solar has gone from no generation to about 3 million GWh, gas looks like it's about doubled from 3 to 6 million GWh, and coal has risen from 5 to about 8 million GWh.\n\nI wonder why China's generation has increased so much while the United States remained so similar. China has certainly been developing, but more than quintupling their electricity generation seems absurd. What were they doing before they were generating it themselves? Were they importing all of it? I also wonder why no new nuclear energy is being produced when we know how safe and reliable it is.\n\nAs the world looks to move towards renewable energy, we see that fossil fuel consumption is still only increasing worldwide. With climate change impacting the world more and more, we are seeing more extreme weather like the polar vortexes that sweep across the US in winter, plunging the Midwest into wind chills below -40 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\"Electricity Generation in China Soars to More Than Double the United States\"",

The graph also depicts how the world still relies heavily on fossil fuels for more than half of its electricity generation, with coal and gas usage slightly rising. On the other hand, clean energy usage has increased with wind and solar power accounting for a higher proportion of electricity generation.\n\nThe other graphs depict how diverse the composition of electricity generation is in various countries. For example,   the US population is relatively small compared to China and India, but the amount of energy generated by India is much lower than the US. \n\nThe graphs create many questions including the reasoning behind the fluctuations in world electricity generation. There are dips in certain years like 2019 and 2008. I wonder if the decline in 2019 could be due to the COVID-19 pandemic and if the dip in 2008 might relate to the economic recession.\n\nSince living in California I have seen a shift in energy consumption just in my hometown. In the last few years, there have been decisions to decommission oil rigs off the coast and developments of new battery storage systems that are working towards being emission-free. Overall, the graphs help depict the story of how electricity generation has changed over the years, therefore a catchy name could be “The Megawatt Movement”.",

I wonder why everyones wind and solar sections haven't drastically increased in the last couple of years. All we ever hear is how good solar energy and wind power is and I would think by now it would have drastically increased in other places.

These electric generators have been leading since the graphs origin point which started in the year 2000. In comparison natural fossil fuels like coal and gas are on the low end of generation being the two lowest used forms of electricity generation in the world. I wonder about the history behind this graph? Can the growth of the types of electrical generation on this graph be put in a linear model or was there some point in time that coal and gas were leading electrical generation? This relates to my community because as I grow older technology is becoming more and more engraved in human life, which means more and more electricity is being taken in.

If any of these countries are net importers of energy then their total consumption would be higher, whereas if they're net exporters it then it would be lower. \n\nWe can figure out something about the trends in production though. Overall, energy production has nearly doubled in 22 years. Coal and gas still by far make up the largest part of the market however wind and solar production is increasing at the fastest rate. Nuclear and other seam to have slightly reduced in production and hydro slightly increased.\n\nThere are two dips in production at around 2008 and 2019 (less pronounced in coal). I wonder what caused them. Something to do with the GFC and COVID19?\n\nIn terms of country level, China is by far producing the most coal and its coal production has increased around 4 times since 2000 and it looks to be the biggest coal producer in the world.\n\nIn the US by comparison, coal production has decreased by more than half and oil has increased. Oil and gas combined has stayed fairly steady and still make up more than half of overall production. Overall US energy production has stayed fairly steady over the 22 years.  \n\nIndia does not produce very much energy at all compared to the other countries and it is mostly coal.",

India is the second most populated country on Earth with about 4 times the population of the US, but it's still VERY underdeveloped. More than 10% of the country is below the world poverty line. India doesn't have much industry, so that's likely why it doesn't generate so much energy despite being so big and populous.

For example, China exhibits a strong and fast linear growth between the years 2000 and 2020, whereas India’s is more gradual and the United State’s seems to be staying relatively the same. However, overall all countries seem to be using more clean sources, such as nuclear, than they do fossil. This makes me wonder whether the world is truly getting ‘cleaner’ or if these countries are slowly straying away from using fossil fuels to generate electricity.

Do you think we will achieve our increase in temperature limits  given what you see in these graphs.  \n\nYou may want to look at the March 13, 2024 New York Times article “Energy Appetite in U.S. Endangers Goals on Climate.” A free link to this article will be shared on Friday.",
