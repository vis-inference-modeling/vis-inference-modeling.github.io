For someone to be so good, so old, and so dang handsome is true skill. Is this level of skill naturally achievable, or are his superhuman abilities genetic? LeBron will have a chronicle impact on the NBA for being known as the man that couldn\u2019t be beat. His work ethic and constant effort allows him to always out-compete his opponents.",

If we take a closer look at LeBron james has been demolishing the competition by being consistently higher in lifetime career points for the people of his age, he has always been at the top of the game. I also notice that there are these points in time where the line stays stagnant and then gets a surge in points, and as age increases those boost in points decrease. \n\n2. I wonder what makes the patterns of these graphs, for example if we compare LeBron James to Kobe Bryant there's clearly a similarity in the pattern. Both lines seem to rise and stay stagnant at nearly the same time, is it the basketball season that impacts this, if so why do some players have longer breaks than others?\n\n3.

Could it have been that starting at a younger age helped get the title at an earlier age. \n\nThis relates to me and my community because I know there are many basketball and Lebron fans that look up to him. Also, many would want to become one of those players and I think this inspires them to be better, and probably train from a younger age.\n \nHeadline: Lebron surpassing all and becoming... the one, the legend, the King!",

The closest to 40,000 points are Lebron James (38,390) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (38,387).\u00a0 On addition to having a better score, LeBron also has a more linear graph and achieved this earlier in his life (38 years old)\u00a0than Kareem (41 years old). The most frequent scores are around 5,000 to 20,000 points.\n\n2. I wonder if any\u00a0future basketball players will surpass LeBron's scoring\u00a0record that was previously held for 38 years. The game of basketball has changed incredibly over the years and the competition is just getting better and better.\u00a0 As someone who has been playing basketball since I was 4 years old, I understand the game and am truly amazed at how Lebron broke this unbelievable record. If anyone ever breaks it in the future, it will not be easy.\u00a0 However, given that LeBron James put in a lot of hardwork and dedication to score\u00a038,390 points in his career, I question whether this will actually occur.\n\n3. This relates to me because I have been playing basketball since I was 4 years old and am a big fan of Lebron. He is an inspiration and is definitely one of the best athletes of all time. I personally have seen a lot of his games and actually watched him break the record on TV. \n\n4. Lebron James: The King Conquers Scoring",

LeBron and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar both have identical overall scoring totals, however Abdul-Jabbar didn't catch up to LeBron until he was about 42 years old. One can see\u00a0 that from his rookie season to year 20, Lebron has been the most consistent scorer.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nWhen Lebron reaches the same age as Kareem from the moment in his career when he scored the most points, I wonder what his point average will be. I also wonder if the players on your squad have any bearing on your ability to score points. Lebron and Kareem were receiving assists and support from others, so they weren't scoring all by themselves. I'm curious to know if their scoring streaks reduced after being traded or switched to different teams.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis is relevant to my town because many young people in my city aspire to play in the NBA, and it demonstrates that you can surpass the scoring leader you were raised knowing if you put in a lot of effort and dedication. It relates to my generation and how we are innovating and growing younger while achieving goals that others who came before us accomplished at a more older age.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?

This is crazy to think about, as I have watched LeBron James almost half of his career, and have watched him play since I became a serious basketball fan in 2015. Another thing I noticed is that Rudy Gay is on this list. It's interesting because the graph claims he hit 17,500 points at age 36, and he is 36 right now. Rudy Gay is only currently averaging 4.8 points per game for a struggling Utah Jazz team, and is not playing too many minutes per game (15 on a good night). The point I'm trying to drive home, is that you wouldn't expect to see Gay on a list with LeBron, Michael Jordan, Kobe, Curry, etc. I also remember the night LeBron passed Kobe. It was an exciting night, but tragedy ensued the next morning when Kobe Bryant unfortunately passed away at everyone's surprise.\n\n2.) I wonder where Russell Westbrook lands on this list. He was a really good second fiddle to Kevin Durant for awhile in OKC, and then was their leading scorer for a couple of years. I also wonder if anyone will ever break LeBron's scoring record (My guess is Luka Doncic or Victor Wembanyama IF it happens).\n\n3.) This has an impact on me and my community because a lot of people from my town watch basketball. Even people from my Stats class watch it, such as my great teacher Mr. Hibino and some classmates such as Charlie and Enzo.\n\n4.) Catchy title: LeScoringTitle",

The previous scoring record of 38,387 points was held by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  The main thing I noticed is how LeBron James reached this high amount of points at a younger age in comparison to the last record holder.  He reached 38,390 points by the time he was 38 years old.  Abdul-Jabbar did not reach his point total until he was 42.  I wonder what other factors play into these results.  Did they suffer any injuries that stopped them from earning more points? How many games did it take them to reach these totals?  This relates to me and my community because many people are fans of the NBA, and specifically LeBron James.  It is also interesting to watch history be created.  I would entitle this graph: \"Record Breaking Scoring.\"",

This means that he was able to accumulate the most points in the least amount of time. The longest careers also seem to correlate to the  highest career scores. This makes sense since the longer that people are allowed to play, the most points they are able to accumulate. \n\nThis relates to me and my community, as the graph seems to show that starting a career in professional sports young, can lead to being successful.\n\nHeadline: The Rise of NBA Stars",

Since LeBron was around 20 years old, he was at the top of the charts for having the most points per age. \n\nI wonder if NBA had better quality in the past than now because most players in the graph are retired. Since 34 years had to pass until someone broke Kareem's record, how much time has to run until someone broke LeBron's record? \n\nThis graph relates to my community because we in Perth Amboy have many young people who love to play Basketball, and seeing LeBron breaking records can inspire them to follow their passion. \n\nNew NBA star leads the points record.",

In addition to starting so early, Lebron was an elite scorer early on, amassing 5,000 points scored before the age of 22. Lebron was the most hyped of prospect of all time, many believing that he would become elite, but others thinking that he would not be able to live up to the massive expectations being put on him. Clearly, he was able to live up to the expectations. At 38 years old, playing 20 seasons in the NBA, Lebron has become the all time scoring leader for the regular season. Not only this, but despite his age of 38, Lebron James is still averaging an astonishing 30.7 points per game. He is undoubtedly one of the greatest players to ever play.",

Another thing I notice is that Lebron James started his career earlier than most of the other players in the graph. This explains why he reaches the top scorer player younger than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Another important factor I noticed is that compared to player Micheal Jordan, there are no extended periods of time with no growth. \n2.I wonder how the graph would differ if the x and y axis were switched? It took 34 years for James to break Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record so I wonder if this new record will be broken in a shorter or longer period of time. \n3.This relates to my community because as a black person in America basketball is one of the most influential sports.

    "comment info": "1) I've noticed that LeBron's point productivity throughout his career has been significantly quicker and greater than that of other basketball players; additionally, he's acquiring these points at a younger age. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone did not reach their total career points total until the age of 42. Another thing to note is that the line graph indicates areas where there is no growth, such as the line graph for Stephen Curry, which might be due to athletes suffering injuries that impacted their overall career points. \n\n2) I'm curious if players' chances of competing against LeBron James for the most points in history have been hampered by injuries. How many career points would Kareem Abdul have scored if the three-point line had been in place in the 1980s? Does the graph account for an 82-game season and the break when COVID 19 forced a nationwide lockdown?\n\n3) This is relevant to me and my community because many youngsters of the new generation have observed an athlete who has committed his life to the sport and may serve as an example to many future NBA players. His narrative is similar to that of many students in our community who come from low-income households and are working hard to get recognition in the sports industry and find opportunities to not only support themselves but their family via the sport that they love. \n\n4) The Crowning of a New King: LeBron James Sweeps the NBA to become the NBA's all-time leading scorer!",

Jordan who is an NBA star reached Kareem's level. Also, the carer points in total for Kareem were achieved at age 42 while Lebron is 38 and still has years to play in the NBA and years to advance. It's incredible where Lebron has gotten. You can tell the hard work paid off because there wasn't a moment in the graph where he wasn't improving he is constantly becoming a better player. \n 2. I wonder if Jordan never took that break and if he would have been up there in score with Kareem and Lebron. I wonder if LeBron ever took a break or wasn't improving for a while and if he would have ever passed Kareem. It takes so much passion to get to that level. \n3. I think this can relate to my community because there are so many kids in my community who want to be great one day. I personally am a basketball fan and have many friends who play ball. One thing about any sport is that it takes hard work and dedication you can never give up or take a break you have to keep improving.

He was able to get the same amount of career points at age 38 from when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was 42. He along with some others were consistent in getting the same amount of career points at every age. It is also noticeable that Lebron is one of the only current players for the top 250 scorers that have passed the amount of career points from previous players. \n\n2. I wonder what caused Lebron to get so many career points at such a young age. Were there different motives or techniques he used to achieve his goal? Will Lebron James continue to gain a number of career points until he retires? \n\n3. This relates to me and my community because someone of color being successful can motivate many others to continue working hard for their dreams, especially the people who want to continue basketball in the future. It could also mean that there could be more good basketball players in the future. \n\n4. Lebron James is On Top! Can He Be Stopped?",

Kareem came in a close second with a similar amount of points only about 4 years after him. Besides this, I also notice the men in the basketball league reaching the high points in their career are incredibly close in age, making 33-38 the most common age for the highest career t points in this graph. \n\nWhat do I wonder?\nI wonder what about Lebron James makes him different enough to have an unbeatable score. Was it his upbringing? His education/ practice? His team? Or simply his dedication? I also wonder what the grey streaks in the graph represent. Could it be other upcoming players? and what distinguishes the blues from the grey in the chart?\n\nHow does this relate to my community and me?\nThis relates to my community and me because sports, basketball specifically, surround every community.

Looking at and analyzing the graph above makes me wonder if there is a proportional relationship between the players' ages and the number of career points they score. Is it possible that the older the players get, the more likely they score high points than someone about a decade younger? Or is there another factor in play that allowed both Lebron and Abdul-Jabbar to achieve the highest career points? \n3. It\u2019s cool not only to witness such an accomplishment but also to say that I was alive when LeBron James scored the highest career points after thirty decades.

We get to look back on LeBron\u2019s journey, as there are films from his high school career all the way to the NBA, and we can watch him reach new limits in live time. The ability to witness history is a gift and an inspiration for many to continue making history in the future, whether it's athletically or within other career areas. Looking at the multiple athletes that have shown exponential career-point growth on the graph, I realize how big of an accomplishment this really is for LeBron, as he breaks a record that has remained for over three decades.",

I noticed that since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is no longer an athlete for a professional team, James hitting the record at a younger age than Abdul-Jabbar means that James is the youngest player to reach that accomplishment. I can make the claim that LeBron James is more successful in basketball than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar because he surpassed Jabbar\u2019s career score at a younger age. \n\nWhat do you wonder? I am interested in discovering the outside factors that led to the graph. I understand that there are dozens of factors that enter into someone\u2019s scoring statistics, thus I wonder what factors affected this data. I also wonder if James would have still surpassed Abdul-Jabbar if any of these factors came into play. \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?  I have grown up in the college basketball community. My father is an alum of Villanova and as a result of Villanova having one of the top basketball programs in the country, my family has always championed the team.

The evidence supports this claim because the blue line tracking his points is clearly above others. Although it may seem close to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the graph clearly states that LeBron James scored 38,390 points while Kareem Abdul-Jabbar only scored 38,397 points. After analyzing the graph, I wonder how many career points LeBron James will account for throughout the entirety of his career. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was 42 years old when he retired and set the previous record. LeBron James is only 38 years old now when he sets the new record. If he continues to play for a few more years how many more points will he score? Will anyone beat his record? This relates to me and my community because it shows people that someone is always able to create a record. New records motivate thousands of people to work harder just so they can have the highest record. About 34 years ago when the previous record was set, people thought that was the record for life, until, LeBron James came to set the current record. This refers back to the previous article we read where we cannot label someone as the \u201cG.O.A.T.\u201d (Greatest Of All Time) because there will always be someone better in the future.

There are also a bunch of names underneath Lebron James with some of the most well-known NBA players of all time. I also notice that the ages of the NBA players are on the x axis and the total career points are on the y axis. My claim would be that Lebron James will pass 50,000 career points by the end of his career. The evidence supports it because the graph shows Lebron is 38 years old and has scored 40,000 career points. The NBA player, Kareem Abdul Jabar, played until he was 42 years old and he has less than Lebron\u2019s career points. Therefore, I believe that in 4 years time Lebron could score 10,000 more career points.\nThis relates to me specifically because Lebron James has truly been one of my all time favorite athletes. He comes from an incredible background and the fact that he is now the ALL-TIME NBA leading scorer His dedication, hard work, and his overall attitude inspires me to be better and work harder. Lebron James passing this record affects the entire NBA community and gives him an even higher point in the debate of the best basketball player of all time.",

With the age of the player being on the x-axis and the number of points on the y, we can see just how amazing Lebron James was. The former leader in points took until after the age of 40, unlike Lebron who took the record around the age of 36. I also notice how the graph includes current players such as Stephen Curry, James Harden, Kevin Durant, and Rudy Gay. Lebron, in this graph, is showcasing the utter dominance he held over the NBA leading him to become the all-time scoring leader. This graph makes me wonder what Michael Jordan could have accomplished with a full career. Jordan took a considerable break from the NBA, as shown by the graph, and looks like he would have been on pace to also pass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. It also makes me wonder if Kevin Durant has a shot of coming in at third on the all-time leaderboard as he is also on pace with Karl Malone and Michael Jordan. The addition of Kobe Bryant also makes me question if he didn\u2019t get hurt could he have possibly passed the record? Per the graph, it seems so as he was extremely close to Lebron James before his long break. \nLebron James' utter dominance demonstrates why he is the greatest player of all time",

Lebron is on his way to becoming one of the best basketball players of all time because of his career points and the fact that he was the youngest player to ever reach those points. In the graph, my evidence can be supported on the x-axis where it says different ages. If you look at the plotted points and how Lebron\u2019s line continuously increases you can see that he has scored the most points out of anyone in each age range. \n2. I wonder if there will ever come a time when someone is able to beat the highest score for career points at a younger age than Lebron did. We know that Lebron has kids who play basketball and there are many more generations to come with basketball prodigies anxious to beat the top scorer. \n3.

My family isn\u2019t as big with basketball as they are football but there have been countless times when we have talked about basketball and even Lebron James.

He broke this record at a younger age than Abdul-Jabbar did, and is currently still playing, which means this record will only continue to increase and will become more difficult for other players to beat. This graph supports the claim that LeBron James is the best basketball player of our time.\n\n2. I wonder how other players would react to this information. LeBron James joined the NBA at just 18 and has beaten so many other talented players in reaching such a lofty goal. The closest active player to reaching this goal would be Kevin Durant, and according to this graph, Durant has a way to go before he even becomes close to LeBron\u2019s stats. I\u2019m assuming this information would be a motivating force to push players harder in order to break James\u2019 record.\n\n3. While I don\u2019t follow the NBA myself, I know several fans who have watched LeBron James from the beginning of his career. This record is astounding and would be celebratory to any of his fans who have supported him since his young start of just 18 years old.

I wonder if there will ever be a player who has a dramatic increase that changes the slope of the line. What would you have to do, training wise, to change your point growth perception. Also, what are the outside factors that make LeBron James slope so much steeper than Stephen Curry or Ruby Gay? Were they taller or had more training, etc. This relates to my community because in my high school teams basketball program, you can see that as a freshman, even the best players have lower career points than they did their senior year.

But, on the other hand, Lebron has scored more than anyone, and he is certainly invoked in this debate against Jordan more than anyone. \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?

The only other player to come close to that number of points was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who played in 1989 but did so at a much later age. All of the other players who came close to those points were in their late 30s or early 40s. LeBron James and a few others have significantly more points than the average basketball player.\n\n2. I'm curious if anything has changed in the sport since the early decades when it was played. Sports, whether it's the rules of the games, the physique of the players, the number of games played, or the circumstances and extra factors, usually evolve as generations pass and better ways of playing it are discovered. So, has anything changed in basketball to allow LeBron to break a record held by a much older and more experienced player?\n\n3. Many people in my community enjoy discussing who the best basketball player is.
