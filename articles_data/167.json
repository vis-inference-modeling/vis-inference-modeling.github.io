As a child of two immigrants who came here for more opportunities, I can personally attest to this. Immigrants do not come to this amazing country to do harm to society or exploit our resources, they come here to build a better life for themselves and their families with the increased opportunities that America has to offer them.\n\nSadly, we live in a society where the current political warfare and stubbornness of people disallows graphs like these to even be looked at or considered. People's opinions are so set in stone that even when looking at facts like this, their minds are not to be changed. I can say that I am guilty of this, and have not been very open-minded in the past.

Not only that, the statement is blatantly not true, as shown by this graph. Now I know not everything is considered, such as the graph not including more rural areas, and that it also doesn't show the change in crime, but this graph disproves any stereotyping you could come up with. The graph shows a simple fact: More undocumented immigrants does not mean a higher crime rate, and it some cases it even lowers the crime rate.\nAmerica was a country built on immigrants, literally, so why are we so adamant to prove that a growing problem with our country is attributed to immigrants rather than accept the blame?",

I'm not even sure why I would say this, because I think of most immigrants as hard workers who come to America to support their families in a safer environment. \n\nI've always struggled with the idea of illegal immigration, although I know that I never have enough facts to back up any claims I would make. To me it seems irresponsible and even lazy, which is maybe why I would jump to the conclusion that immigration brings in crime. However, I know that it is never as simple as that, and that the process of becoming legal can be difficult. I've learned that just because someone struggles going through the process of legalization, it doesn't mean that they have any ill intentions.\n\nThese graphs are eye openers, as they disprove many stereotypes that immigrants are criminals. They also teach me that I can't be so quick to judge, and that it's important for everyone to check statistics before fully developing their opinions.",

Now that I have taken the time to analyze and understand the graph, I notice that it displays a data trend that is contrary to the general public\u2019s belief. It\u2019s actually quite the opposite. I see that this graph show a negative correlation between the number of undocumented immigrants in our country and the number of crimes committed. This graph and the ones accompanying it reveal that as the number of undocumented immigrants in our country rises, the number of crimes committed actually decreases. \n\nI also noted that there was one outlier in the general observation of a negative correlation. The individual graph specific to murder actually has a slight positive correlation. This leads me to wonder why this is a positive correlation and why murder? \n\nOverall, I noted that this graph displays a different relationship between undocumented immigrants and crime rates then what most people believe to be true. Because of this, I think a title that could fit under the category of a \u201chook\u201d or \u201cattention grabber\u201d would be effective. Often times the titles that attract the most people are the most controversial ones. Perhaps a title like  \u201cIllegal Immigrants and Crime: What Does the Data Say?\u201d would do the job.

After reading the revealed article, my presumption was correct, and in fact four of the five categories showed a negative correlation. Logically this makes sense because if they are here illegally they would do their best to stay under the radar of the authorities. Clearly there is a misconception with illegal immigrants being \u201cdangerous\u201d for the citizens of America, but I can understand why they receive some resentment from people. For some people they this as unfair to the people seeking legal status. However, to characterize an entire group for the actions of the minority is absurd and does nothing to fix the problem. \n\nWhen my roof was damaged from Hurricane Florence a few years back, we hired a contractor who employed Hispanic workers. I cannot prove that they were here undocumented, but a lot of the times they will unfortunately be, due to their cheap labor. Regardless of their legal status, they were some of the nicest and hard-working people I have ever met. I remember one worker in particular who would have his wife and kid come over each day so that they could eat together. It was clear to see that this man loved his family more than everything, and I imagine that they are so many other people out there just like him. I hope we can leave this degrading stigma and see people as people, and not a crime.",

The rate of crime in general stayed about the same as more migrants entered the country; the over all violent crime section even went down slightly.\n        The thing that is criminal however is the deplorable actions of our government in response to immigration during these last few years. As far as American hopefuls along the southern border go, people who wish to apply for asylum must stay in camps on the Mexican side of the border until they are able to apply. These camps are extremely unsafe, comprising of mostly tents and rent a john's. If they haven't been robbed, raped, or kidnapped by the time that the US government gets around to them even then it is much less likely to get a lawyer which will help them move more smoothly through the asylum process from Mexico opposed to if they were waiting on the US side. As of January 9th 2019 according to a news report by NBC 24 people have died in US custody. \n        All of these things have been put in place to discourage immigrants from applying and to convince them to just return to their gang-ridden war-torn countries.

The process of gaining citizenship is made incredibly tricky and quite expensive. It costs about $725 per person, and if you had a family of four, the cost is almost 3,000 dollars. \n\nOf course, an impoverished person escaping a country and trying to gain citizenship is going to have 3,000 dollars lying around. The requirement is unrealistic and crazy to expect someone to pay that price. Most immigrants want to start over and live peacefully in a stable country.",

This data is a good win for the side for illegal immigrants, and dismiss many prejudices placed on them, but should not swing anyone to want illegal immigrants in our country.

I believe the tension on this subject could be resolved with immigration reform. I think illegal immigration should not be tolerated and be dealt with seriously, but compassionately. However, legally immigrating is a long, difficult, expensive process for many people who are simply seeking asylum from the dangers in their own country. That said, immigration should be made easier and cheaper, but still have certain requirements (like extensive background checks, a sound reason for coming, and valid identification).",

I don\u2019t believe our country needs another reason to discriminate against people of color, so for this claim to be made without evidence is irresponsible. I\u2019m sure there is some relation to violent crimes and undocumented immigrants when it relates to something like selling illegal drugs, but I believe this is a small percentage of these immigrants.  The majority are coming here to escape violence and to make a better life for themselves and their families. I\u2019m sure most are trying to stay unnoticed, so they wouldn\u2019t be committing crimes that would possibly get them arrested and deported. I\u2019m also not sure that this can even be measured.  No one knows how many undocumented immigrants are in the US, so this is all just guess work.

This could mean that, despite popular belief, the number of undocumented immigrants could mean less crime, instead of more.  However, the trend is only ever so slightly negative, and the points on the plot are very spread out.  This means the decrease could be purely coincidental, not very strongly supported by the evidence.  \n\nHowever, the graph gets broken down into 5 different categories: Assaults, Robberies, Murders, Burglaries, and Larcenies.  If the negative trend was a coincidence, the trends in the split plots would be, well, split.  Some would have positive trends, some would have negative trends.  This wasn\u2019t the case.  Murders were the only category that saw an increase with a higher immigrant populations.  All the other groups saw a decrease, even if slight.  \n\nSo why was murder increasing?  Well I\u2019d like to point out that yes, it had an incline, but a very slight one.  I believe this is because the immigrants are the ones being murdered.  Being undocumented, they\u2019re vulnerable, and it seems like a fitting explanation for why murder is the only positive graph.",

However, after a few minutes of thinking about it, I had a few observations about how this survey was done. \nI wondered how they could find these undocumented immigrants to take the survey from since the majority of them would be hiding from the law in the first place. Also, since many of the big cities in America have declared themselves sanctuary cities, they would not cooperate with the Federal government by providing information about the immigrants. In addition, the sanctuary cities do not charge many undocumented immigrants with crimes because they do not want to risk them being deported if they have to go to court.

This graph disproves that archaic assertion. This graph proves that despite the president\u2019s claims, undocumented immigration is not dangerous. This graph proves that it is wrong to put children in cages and seperate families for crossing \u201cillegally\u201d.",

They all appear to have a body of points right before the number zero, and looking at it trying to figure it out just seems to me that they have no common theme or correlation to better put it. These graphs are about crime rates and immigrants traveling into the country and frankly, I do not see how these graphs are helping to prove any certain point. \n\nI do not see any increases in the graphs, I mainly see decreases. As you look at the grah you can see that as there are more undocumented immiggrants the crime rates go down actually instead of up. I have never been good at reading graphs so taking a stab at this one is very hard. Some of the graphs seem to show differences that do not make sense relating to the article. Overall I think that these graphs actually disprove the statement that immigrants are causing illegal crimes.",

On all of the graphs, the crime rates show a slight consisty on the amount of crimes happening, in one of the years, all the types of crimes went up, but eventually all went down. In my opinion, the rise in undocumented immigrants don\u2019t have much to do with each other, not saying that they don\u2019t play a role at all but to just put two labels on this would be arrogant, we don\u2019t know what race or background the people who are commmiting these crimes are. We get a small grasp of what caused these crimes and the people behind it too. Without any proper details we are left with our assumptions which can create a worse stigma for others who have to deal with the association that being undocumented means they are dangerous in some way.",

Almost all of the graphs except for the Murder one show a trend line going down as immigrants increase. And sure murder isn\u2019t good at all but it\u2019s not a trend that is really noticabe enough for illegal immigrants and murders to be associted.\nIt makes sense that violent crimes go down as Illegal immigrants increase, since many are seeking to get away from a horrible situation back home. They\u2019re looking for a better life, that\u2019s enough reason not to go around and committing crimes left and right.\nIt is in bad nature to assume one a criminal just because they\u2019re an outsider we do not like. Especially when most of them have good intentions but are just desperate. Unfortunately most people don\u2019t buy that. As soon as you crossed the border you\u2019re a criminal. I guess I could see the viewpoint of that, after all they are illegal immigrants, they broke the law just by getting here, therefore they are criminals. But there\u2019s a difference between someone who crossed the border seeking a better life and someone who assaults, murders and steals.",

The United States has discriminated against certain groups of people for nearly the entirety of its history. One of the groups that have been treated brutally are undocumented immigrants. Even though there may be a few immigrants who do increase the crime rates in their neighborhoods, the majority of them only come to America hoping to achieve the American Dream. They are ordinary people who were born in terrible conditions and wish to improve their lives by coming to America and finding a job. We should give undocumented immigrants the chance to receive the opportunities offered in America and accept them into our society.",

In the United States, we stereotype undocumented immigrants as people who are likely to harm our country. Ironically, the exact opposite is true; places where a higher number of undocumented immigrants reside experience a lower frequency of violent crimes. These statistics demonstrate that the majority of people in America have been incorrect in their judgement of immigrants and that they do not harm our society. \n\nNot only do the number of violent crimes decrease with an increase in undocumented immigrants, but there is decrease in burglaries, assaults, robberies, and larcenies. With the exception of murders, the frequency of every crime diminishes with a higher number of immigrants. Instead of being a threat to our society, undocumented immigrants seem to help our society. As proven by these graphs, we should deflecting the blame upon undocumented immigrants for crime that occurs in our country.",

A lot of these crimes are happening because of immigrants, but the crime rate seems to be going down for everything except for murder, on a slight rise. These crimes also don't seem to be as extreme as they used to be, the people are getting more docile in their attempts. The second thing I notice is that while murder is on the rise, those murders are getting more severe (I know that the murder graph is smaller in size).  I'm curious about why we are more efficient in stopping crime, but less able to stop murders any more than we already are. Sure, we still have a lot of crime stemming from immigrants, but why are we more diligent in stopping a crime rather than a soon-to-be killer.

I would like to see a similar graph with only American citizens living in the same cities for reference, and even get as specific is seeing the crime in different parts of the cities. I do not know if this amount of crime is normal for any group of people, or lower or higher, so having those statistics to be able to analyze would add meaning to this graph. Every other graph (assaults, robberies, burglaries, larcenies) show a similar trend, all except the graph on murder statics. Even so, I would not say that this graph is at its peak or even very high; the data is too far spread out to really draw any conclusions of a positive or negative correlation.

It is ridiculous that we are even debating the subject of open borders even though that isn't what the article focuses on. In almost any country, it is a federal crime to be an illegal immigrant. If you want to leave and become part of the american economy become informed on the country itself and learn from what you left. If you are coming from as a refugee you are coming into a democracy, and if you are going to come legally. I know it might take a while to deal with your papers and ect but if you want to be and american you have to do it the right way. If we had open boarders there would be an insane amount of sex trafficking, drugs and illegal operations coming into our country. A closed border keeps our citizens safe. If you come here you should have to take on the responsibilities as everyone else and not live off government welfare and the peoples of Americas taxes and free health care, it is a privilege to live in such a great country and a right you need to earn.

The graph shows neither a strong positive correlation nor a strong negative correlation, as the points on the graph are mainly scattered, with some points below and above the trend line. What interests me is that the point with the lowest amount of illegal immigrants has a high violent crime rate, but the point with the highest amount of illegal immigrants has a lower violent crime rate. The points seem to represent both the amount of crime and undocumented immigrants, but I wonder if they also take into account the year the information was given, as the years are not explicitly labeled on the graph. I also wonder if the results would be drastically different if the statistics given were not taken from the 180 metropolitan areas from the graph. Title: \"Illegal Immigration and Metro Crime\"",

In fact, while this is likely due to external factors, it appears that metropolitan areas with a higher increase in undocumented immigrants had fewer crimes. It's possible that between 2007-2016 certain highly populated areas expanded their law enforcement, but as this graph only touches on correlation and not causation, it leaves the topic up for debate. As we can see in the other four graphs, crime has diminished with the turning of the decade.

Also, as you wrote, there are many other variables, including changes in policing that may have affect the variables.  By including 180 metropolitan areas \u2013 a rather large sample, we have reduced the effect of these variables. \n\nRegarding how the study determined the number of undocumented immigrants, come back tomorrow in the late afternoon.

What evidence do you have that supports your claim that \u201cas more undocumented immigrants are present, then the less violent crimes there are?\u201d   Careful with the labels you use for undocumented immigrants and violent crimes.  (Take another look at the title.  Titles can be very informative.)\n\nI wonder what the association between undocumented immigrants and crime is. In the United Kingdom.    Maybe an internet search would come up with some research.\n\nHow about a catchy headline that captures your noticing?",
