I notice that most war headlines usually are at their height in the middle of the war as opposed to the beginning of the end which is surprising to me because I would think that the announcement of a war beginning or ending would make a lot of headlines.

Aside from interpreting the graph itself and making inferences and educated guesses, I have seen this desensitization firsthand. Many young people (younger than 12 years old) aren\u2019t aware that we are at war, and have been since before most of them were born. This, alongside the graph shows a change in America towards not only our ignorance of war and its atrocities, but our indifference to it, and that is more horrifying than any war crime.",

This may be because of the disinterest of the American people in wars that don't affect them or seem far away because WWI & WWII both have much more headlines than recent wars.\n\nFinally, I noticed that at a similar time to when the Vietnam draft occurred, the coverage decreased. This could be due to the fact that people do not want to read about the danger their sons and husbands are undergoing. Another idea that is people dislike the draft and want to pull out, influencing the media to talking about the war less. \n\nSome things I wondered about was what factors resulted in the Iraq war being covered more than the Afghanistan war and what this graph would look like fro sources other than the New York Times.",

Many newspaper and reports were made on this war, as the world was shook by this terrifying war that lasted for 4 years. As the years passed though, many more wars occurred, and there was even another second World War. But as the years passed, there became less headlines. But why is that? Is there a lack of interest in wars? The truth is, they're just not put on the front covers as headlines that much. In fact, a lot of information on these wars could be recorded on something of recent innovations: social media and the internet. The internet is a vast source of knowledge and communications, and is a great way for the younger generations to discuss and create content. An example would be in January, at the start of 2020. Many memes on World War 3 was being made, and all of them were mainly put on social media. The ease to record and talk about these issues, making them a big topic of discussion, doesn't have to be covered on the headlines of big newspaper to gain lots of attention. So it makes sense as to why there's a lack of headlines on these wars.",

For example, maybe headlines decrease because people do not care so much so it is not often spoken about, wars occur often and its has grown into such a common normality that people are no longer surprised or effected by the wars. I would like to add that for many of the wars, the headlines decrease as the war comes to an end, which is quite interesting to me because, I would also assume that as the wars come to an end people would more likely celebrate or spread news. I also believe that these wars are no longer used because even with the large amount of news article in the world, New York Times as well, and it makes me wonder why does it no longer appear on headlines, and lead me to assume that they understand what the audience likes, and what the headlines are in order to gain attention from the media. <3",

Another interesting trend is that as wars go on, the later years of the war start to receive less coverage by the New York Times; the majority of the graphs are skewed right. \n\nThe most pressing question is why the number of war-related front-page headlines has largely been decreasing over the past century. One answer could be that as society has industrialized and modernized, more issues have started coming into focus in our society -- for instance, the coronavirus today or global warming may be taking away from war coverage. Regardless, the impact of this graph and it's conclusions is profound, because media is the way most people get their information, and understanding how our media describes events differently is pivotal for us in shaping the way our society thinks.\n\nTitle: War-Coverage Falters Over the Past Century",

Since this data comes from The New York Times, possibly, is the reason for more headlines during certain wars because it was closer to America?

These wars include World War 1 and 2, the Korean, Vietnam, and Gulf Wars, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. WWI had the highest number of headlines, which was over 75. The number of headlines peaked in the second year of the war and then continued to decline. WWII had less headlines than WWI, with just over 50. After these wars, the number of headlines got significantly smaller, with the exception of a slight increase at the beginning of the Iraq war. I wonder why the number of headlines decreased. It could be because at the time of the world wars the United States was not used to fighting in these kinds of wars and thus it was shocking to the public. Maybe American values changed and they started to care less about war as time went on. One possible title for this graph could be \"War Headlines Every Year.\"",

The Iraq and Afghanistan war have the lowest amount of headlines. I also notice that World War 1 has the highest headline. I notice that Afghanistan has the lowest headline. The Gulf War is the shortest war. I wonder if the data collectors used subset groups to create smaller groups because other wars are not mentioned in the chart. I wonder why the news is only interested in war when it first starts. I wonder why the news isn't as interested in the war once it's over.

I don't think that anybody wanted to hear or see these evil acts repeated again so they choose to ignore the crimes happening all over the world. The least amount of headlines were in the Gulf war.

I wonder why that as time has passed, headlines involving wars have decreased. This is possibly due to a shift in values from the government and the people. For instance, WWI was the first large-scale world war the United States became involved with, and an emphasis was placed on propaganda and funding through war bonds. Although war still plays a role in American life, attitudes in reference to the direct and looming urgency for unity and military funding have somewhat lessened over time.

Afghanistan has the lowest number of headlines. The decrease might have to do with the lack of physical newspapers and digitally there are more headlines. People are also probably less concerned with more recent wars because there was no draft.",

In addition, while this may be more applicable to the mid-late 2000s, perhaps technology and online news sites contributed to the decrease of front pages in general, as many began to receive their news online as opposed to physical newspapers. \n\nTitle: \"No New News\"",

When Americans do watch the news they want it to be something new, or groundbreaking. This is unfortunate because news on wars today is just as relevant as it was over 100 years ago during WWI. I wonder if this data includes online headlines.",

Maybe they don\u2019t want people to worry, or they don\u2019t have a lot of information to give, or maybe the war has just been going on for too long and people have lost interest. Either way, wars are an unfortunate part of our lives at the moment, and I think news articles and magazines should report on them more.",

Is it because after a certain amount of time it becomes old news? Is it because they're not as big of a deal as others? I have many questions about this graph, and I am curious about the real reason the coverage declined.",

WW1, the first major war of the world, has over 75 headlines, while the Afghanistan/Iraq war has an extremely low number of headlines. I think this is happening because people are getting used to always being at war. I also notice that for most of these wars, the shorter they are, the more coverage they have. I think this is because people lose interest in the event. People stop caring to read about a war that has been going on for 15+ years.",

        "comment info": "@Jude Lucido \nI totally agree with so many of your points. The amount of coverage for each event has decreased as the years have increased because of the short attention span that people have. Relating to today\u2019s wars, there\u2019s just so much stuff happening in the world like new technology and inventions, school pressure, and disease outbreaks that we\u2019ve been distracted from the supposedly large issue that is a war. The low headlines you mentioned could be an effect of news reporters not wanting to continue reporting on the same issue for 18 years straight. There\u2019s 6570 days in that span of time and I\u2019m guessing only 20 of them would be dedicated to coverage and updates on a war. Even that\u2019s generous. \n\nOn your point about people becoming accustomed to war, I\u2019m not sure that people get used to being in war, I think we just forget about it. There\u2019s been no sudden draft since 1973, so men and women in America don\u2019t have to worry about anything relating to war anyway. This is especially true considering every single one of the wars mentioned was fought in another country. America was never directly affected by any of them, so there\u2019s no need to go all out on media coverage. Even if reporters were to want to cover the issue, they wouldn\u2019t have enough video footage since they would have to travel to other countries in dangerous war time, something I bet not many would do. So yes, everyone including the reporters stop caring, but I don't think we get used to war altogether.",

From WW1 to WW2, the headline quantity significantly decreased and has decreased in a linear fashion ever since. In Vietnam, it can be noted that during the beginning of the war, there was much more headline coverage than at the end of the war, in which you\u2019d expect there to be war conclusion stories bombarding everyone. This graph has an underlying message that the significance and importance of war has drastically decreased ever since WW1, highlighting American\u2019s ignorance towards recent war efforts.

What i am trying to say is: 1. Humans don\u2019t learn from other generations mistakes 2. Not only they do not learn, they keep on going bolder in repeating some attrocities like afghanistan/iraq. On top, vietnam and koreea wars seem rather fair in number of war headline coverings,  because they were rather close in time to each other, and rather on the same east side of the globe compared to usa/europe, and had a smaller number of headliness thus, because it seemed not to affect directly the populations carrying the wars.

And, together we\u2019ll go even further in our understanding.  \nThese are the headlines that were published during each of the wars.  The ones afterwards are not shown.  \n\nBe careful of the x-axis.  It does not have equal intervals.  For example, there should be a bigger space between WWI and WWII than between WWII and the Korean War.\n\nPlease return tomorrow late afternoon when we will release the link to the article that includes this graph and several others that compare the wars that the US has fought in since 1900.  There, you may get more insights to your wondering about why there are few headlines for the most recent wars.",
