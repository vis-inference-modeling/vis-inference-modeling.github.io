The graph shows that we had a high percentage (10-15%) of foreign-born Americans between 1850 and 1910 (most of these immigrants were Canadian, Irish, and German). Then in 1921 Congress introduced quotas per country on immigration. This put a limit on the amount of people from each country that could be granted citizenship per year. This saw a plummet in all immigration until it was rolled back in 1965. After 1965, through to 2010, the percentage went back up to 10-15. The immigrants, however, were from different countries.

I would like to know your thoughts on this!\n\nI can't help but wonder if people from foreign nations became wary about immigrating to the US because they thought the American Dream was a myth. Plenty of immigrants in the early 1900s faced incredible hardships and a surprising lack of opportunity when they arrived in the US, so my thought is that it's possible they were worried about how much success they would truly have here.",

Did other countries take similar courses of action during these times? \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nI come from a family of immigrants, and I live in a community that is primarily first or second-generation in the US.

But over time immigrants from Europe began decreasing starting at the year 1950 meanwhile the people from other regions of America mainly from Mexico started coming to the U.S.  I wonder why people from Europe stopped immigrating to the U.S. as frequently as they used to and why was there a sudden increase in the people from America mainly from Mexican people. My main question is what factors affect the people from these countries to immigrate and what causes them to make them not want to immigrate anymore, or reduce the amount of people that immigrate. This relates to me because I am a Mexican citizen and I want to know more about  why so many people from my country have decided to immigrate to the U.S. and if I ever have to consider that as an option in my life. Maybe it's because the U.S. has so many opportunities that maybe the people of my country dont have or because of another factor that makes us want to leave that I should be aware about.

    "comment info": "This graph demonstrates the change in immigration from the year 1850 to after 2010.  In the 1800s, there was a large amount of Irish and German immigrants and a small amount of Canadians.  In 1920, the US government implemented an immigration act that set quotas for how many immigrants could come from each country.  In the 60s, this quota was taken away and immigration began to rise again.  On the right side of the second line, the largest group is no longer Europe, but rather Mexico and Canada.  The main thing that stands out is the large decrease after the quota was put in place.  It was probably very difficult for people to come to America at this time.  I wonder what caused the shift in what people were immigrating.  I wonder if wars in Asia had anything to do with this increase in their immigration after the quota was dropped.  Immigration is relevant to the community because people from new places are constantly coming to America and it is important to be aware of the situation.  I would call this, \"A Shift in Immigration Demographics\"",

This makes me wonder how the government came up with these cap numbers. I imagine they would use country population sizes and percent of immigrants already in the US population to decide how many more immigrants they can accept from each country every year. However, I wonder if racism also factored into this decision. For example, we learned about the Chinese Exclusion Act which prohibited all immigration of Chinese workers for ten years. Perhaps this accounted for why the population of Asian immigrants is lower than immigrants from other continents. I also noticed that data about African immigrants doesn\u2019t go all the way back to the 1850s and seems to start as late as the 1970s. This makes me wonder if data on African immigrant populations doesn\u2019t exist before then. We learned about how African Americans' lineages can be very difficult to trace. This is largely a result of slavery since many slaves didn\u2019t have birth and death certificates. This graph relates to me because both my parents are immigrants. My mom is from the Philippines and my dad is from England, and it\u2019s interesting to see where they fit into the graph when they immigrated in the 1990s.

I wonder what may have changed to cause them to not immigrate as much later, for example, from the 1960s to 2020-ish. There aren't nearly as many immigrants after Congress rolls back quotas. However, we do see a huge rise in immigrants from Mexico, but not that many earlier on. This inverse correlation is interesting, and I wonder why there aren't as many Canadian immigrants later. Also, earlier, there were lots of Irish, German, and other Europeans recorded as immigrants. To top it off, there are many more Middle Eastern, African, and Asian immigrants near the end. I can see the line for Asia, and I think I can hardly see, but still kind of see, the line for Africa and the Middle East. This relates to my community because my community is made up of people. If more people in my community are immigrants, they bring with them things from their culture, religion, they bring customs, and they influence other people with their ideas. This is actually very important. If we never see or get to know people from other countries, cultures, and religions, we might make incorrect judgement on them and misunderstand some things they may do or believe.

Also, the German population in America seems to have been at a height in the late 1800s before thinning out in the 1900s. The Canadian population in America had remained consistent until recent decades. Also, when Congress passed quotas all of the populations of other nationalities fell down extremely low.",

    "comment info": "After studying the model, I considered the most noticeable change was the decrease in population born abroad after congress enacted the the immigration quotas in 1921. Furthermore, the country with the most population born abroad is Canada.I do wonder why the rest of the countries are specifically Ireland and Germany in 1850- 1910. Why were so many Germans moving, why were so many Irish people moving? I also wonder why middle eastern immigrants and African immigrants began to pick up in the early 2000's as well.  All of these immigrants are somehow related to someone in our town. The reason so many people have Irish and German in their blood is because of the vast amount of immigrants coming from those European countries in the 1800's to early 1900's. The graph captures the percentage of people born abroad, and predicts how many people will be born abroad in the future. \"How laws effect population diversity\" would be a good title for this graph.",

Prior to the enactment of the 1921 country-based Immigration Quota, there was a larger proportion of Irish and Germans immigrants. This is sensible considering that during the latter half of the 19th century, the Irish potato famine resulted in a mass exodus of people seeking a better life in the US. Same with Germany, as economic hardship, religious persecution, and violent revolutions have caused millions to flee during a similar time period. Immigration remained consistent after the enactment of the quotas until the quotas were lifted in 1965.What is interesting after 1965 was that the primary country of immigration was no longer dominated by the Europeans, but rather by China, Canada, and Mexico. This is indicative of the shift in economic hardship that took place in the world of the past century. While Europe was stabilizing, Mexico and China began to falter. A major increase of North American immigration started to pick up during the 1990s during the commencement of Industrial Westernization, otherwise know as the process of moving factories form North America, to China. Mexico's economy collapse after this, and many sought better economic opportunity in the states.",

It could be attributed to the fact that the US was still a relatively new country, and many perceived the U.S. to have lots of opportunities. I notice that in the earliest 50-ish that the graph depicts, a large chunk of the US population that was born abroad came from Ireland. I wonder if it was because of the potato famine at that time. I also notice that following a spike in immigration during the 1910s, Congress established immigration quotas that directly led to a significant decrease in the share of the US population that was born abroad. I noticed that after Congress rolled back the immigration quotas, there was a drop in the US population that was born in Europe, and an increase in immigration from the Americas and Asia. I wonder what led Congress to enact and eventually revoke their immigration quotas; what kind of measures were they looking at that influenced their decision? I see that starting around the 2000s, there were more immigrants from the Middle East and Africa when prior to that time period they weren\u2019t even visible on the graph.

Though, this plot hides the percentage of illegal immigrants.\n\nA few comments about what happens after 1968.\n\nI don't think that we can reach conclusions about the mechanisms of the changes without looking at the absolute numbers that make the percentages. A change in the percentage can be due to increase/decrease of the immigration rate and/or to a decrease/increase of the native population (e.g. due to changes in the birth rate). \n\nIf we had to assume that the US native population is constant over time (i.e. population growth is due only to immigrants, at least in the post WW2 time), and in the context of growing world population (doubled in the last 50 years) we see that Europe (no population growth) has an apparent decrease in the share of immigrants compared to other regions (e.g. Asia and Africa) whose population is growing rapidly. This may indicate that the change in immigration pressure is simply due to changes in demographic pressure. \n\nWe may also attribute the growth in the share of immigrants from the Americas as due to the bad economic conditions in most of the latin-american countries after 1990.",

At one point in time immigrants made up about 15% of the US population. Immigrants of color and minorities did not start showing substantial numbers on the graph until after the quota roll back in 1965.\n\nFor most of the time I used to analyze the graph I wondered what the influx lines on the graph were but then I came to the realization that they represented different countries from the categories given. I also wondered what countries would fall into the \u2018other\u2019 category and I also wondered what world events played a significant part in the population of immigrants in the US\n\nBeing from NYC we see a lot on the news about new immigration laws or new housing debates to help these people looking for refuge from warring countries or those just looking for a better life. For example, in our city there is currently a debate about a new housing center on Randall\u2019s island for immigrants that are having trouble finding housing. This center is supposed to only house them for a week but the opposing side of the debate is concerned with the lack of proper heating on Randall\u2019s island and the lack of housing, which will make it very difficult to get immigrants into better homes in under a week.\n\nAmerica: the country of immigrants and immigration quotas",

I also see that beginning in the 1970s, Africans begin to immigrate to the United States.\u00a0I see that for almost a century, Europe dominated with almost 15% of the U.S. immigration population for about a century.\n\n2) I wonder whether there was any connection between the events in Africa in the 1960s and 1970s and the immigration of people with African ancestry in\u00a0addition to the expanding numbers of their populations and cultures. I wonder what events led to a majority percentage of Europe migrated within the span of a century. I wonder why the U.S. Congress pulled back on its pre-established quotas.\n\n3) The majority of people in my community, including myself, are Hispanic, therefore it pertains to us. A majority of Perth Amboy's citizens have immigrated to the Americas from their birthplace. I have grandparents who were immigrants themselves, and Hispanics make up a sizable portion of the population who immigrates to the United States. Some of my closest friends immigrated from Mexico or the Dominican Republic so it's fascinating to see how large 15% really is in the scope of the population. \n\n4) \"Two Decades of Diversity: Countries Share in U.S. Population\"",

An example of a passed act included the Refugee Act in the late 1970's. Another probable cause could have been the Nigerian ad Ethiopian wars that occurred during the 1960's and 1970's, which also could have led to the immigration of Africans. After these events the Africans started to increase in population in the United States.\n\nI wonder if the events in Africa during the 1960's and 1970's had any influence on the immigration of African-born individuals.

Maybe congress created quotas because they feared too many immigrants would move to the United States. As for why there were less immigrants from Germany and Ireland, it might be because it was around the Depression and World War II. Lastly, I completely agree with what you said about how it impacts us. The United States would be nothing without immigrants as they bring new cultures and perspectives.",

Lastly, immigration quotas resulted in a drastic drop in immigration to the U.S., until those quotas were rolled back.\n2. I wonder what caused the huge influx of Irish, German, and Canadian immigrants to the United States. What political or economic circumstances caused all these people to leave their homes, did all these people positively or negatively impact the United States, these are things I wonder about. I can relate this to statistics in the sense that the more instability a country is experiencing, the more likely it is that people are to leave. \n3. This relates to my community because the increase of Mexicans to the United States probably resulted in me being an American citizen. My parents immigrated from Mexico to here, and that is why I have the privilege of being an American citizen. They probably took note of everyone else leaving their homes and making their way to the U.S. and decided to go as well.

One thing that this graph also shows is the effects that were made after congress's decision on creating country-based immigration quotas. This decision led to a drastic change with the percentages decreasing. By 1965, once the quotas were rolled back, more immigrants came to the US causing the graph to shift. Overall, the graph alone looks like it fluctuated. \n\nI wonder what led congress on creating country-based immigration quotas in the first place- was there a huge conflict that the graph doesn't cover? \n\nThis relates to my community because I live in a city that is heavily populated by immigrants as well as immigrant descendants.

Then from the time After the quotas were established in 1921 to 1965 there is a decrease in percentage for the U.S population that was born abroad especially with births in the Americas and Europe. After 1965 when the quotas were rolled back an increase in the Share of the U.S Population increased from 1970 and onwards saw an increase from the lowest percentages all around. So it would be said the quotas from 1921 aided in the decline in the U.S population born aboard since when it was established the percentages decrease and after they were rolled back the percentages increased once again.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nHow did these quotas affect the entry of foreign born peoples into the United States?\nDid the Wars affect the entry of different people?\nWhat was Immigration like?\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to our community in the way that many of our parents or grandparents came to the U.S seeking a new life making them part of this graph of the U.S population born abroad.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?

Mexico started immigrating more to the U.S. after that. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder what were the reasons for people to immigrate to the U.S. and if they had similar situations. For example, could it have been that they wanted freedom? Not only that but if the immigration quotas weren't created, would the share of U.S. population percentage have gone past 15% for a country.

Then after Congress creates the quotas, the immigrant population decreases dramatically until it's at or less than 5%. Immediately after Congress rolls back quotas the population increases dramatically again, and this time with immigrants from other continents such as the Americas, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. \n2. I wonder if Congress rolls back the quotas because the lack of immigrants might have had a negative impact on the country and that is why they immediately decided to roll it back. I also wonder why the European population decreased at the same time America's population increased. \n3.  This relates to my community because of the fact that so many of us come from immigrant families that are largely from the Americas. The reason we have such a community is because of the Congress rolling the quotas back. \n4. This graph shows the percentage of the population that was made up of foreign-born people.

I believe the percentage of immigration is different, because of some factors related to the country of origin such as the quality of life, war (world war 1), and internal problems. Also, it depends on some factors about the U.S, such as the hospitality, and acceptability of the country of destination, and the U.S towards such immigrants.\n\nWhat do you wonder?  I wonder what was the motivation of such immigration from the countries of origin, was it mostly to financial problems or related to the factors such as freedom of speech? But my main question is that if it was not a policy between 1921, and 1965 was it possible that we have seen another peak, such as the peak that we can see in 1914? If the policy was the main reason for the reduction in immigration? Is this graph includes illegal immigration?\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?  It explains the current diversity of U.S. The percentage of immigration from Canada decreased.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?  Is the United States really diverse?",

Along with that, before the decrease, a majority were born in Europe, whereas after the drop Mexico/Americas became the largest. \"Other\" countries were also on a gradual increase over the years. The smallest share comes from Africa and the Middle East.\n2) What do you wonder?\nI wonder how much the decrease in immigrants in 1965 affected the economy?\n3) How does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to me and my community as many of us/our families are immigrants from the Americas.\n4) What\u2019s going on in this graph?\nThis graph shows the share of U.S population born abroad over time.
