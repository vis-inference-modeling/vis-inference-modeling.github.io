Releasing a music video within the time frame observed would elevate an artist's popularity levels all over. Even those who aren't fans might watch a new music video just to be up-to-date with the current pop culture. How could the race of artists and the demographic of an area relate? Rihanna and Drake are popular is metropolitan areas, cities. Rihanna is especially popular in the south and along the east coast. Taylor Swift is popular in the wheat belt and mountainous west. It would be interesting to know the exact correlation between the popularity and the racial demographics.",

I also noticed that based on the key below each of the graphs, we can easily see the areas in which each artist is most-least popular. What\u2019s interesting is, the physical placement of where these artists seem to be popular/unpopular are solely based on the way of living in these different States. I was surprised to see that Rihanna was actually more popular in the South than the North\u2026 It\u2019s really evident that there are major differences across our country when looking through music.",

Also, referring to the previous comments, the artists do appeal to different regions of the United States based on the genre of music. At the same time, artists like Drake and Rihanna have similar genres in music because they both sing Hip Hop and R&B.

Taylor Swift and Luke Bryan are considered to be country artists, in which their darker areas are in the rural or country parts of the United States. Rihanna and Drake are not as popular as someone would think in the United States. Drake is more popular in the West than in the East, and for Rihanna, it is the exact opposite.  The Billboard Top 100 are bias because it shows that Rihanna is the number 2 person who is the most watched on Youtube, but the graph shows that she has less people across America not listening to her music. Artists like Taylor Swift and Luke Bryan have more of the United States covered than Rihanna or Drake. It can be speculated that these may have paid of Billboard to help them sell more of their records.",

I also wonder how they differentiated between different users who played the video more than once.\nThese details imply that we as a society have certain social norms. For instance, we expect Luke Bryan to be listened more by the Southern States, but he is not. The same goes for Rihanna because I expected her to be extremely popular in California due to the type of music she puts out. This shows that we automatically associate certain music to certain areas based on stereotypes.\nRihanna is the most popular artist on the graph; however, she is less popular throughout the states. This is due to the fact that Rihanna is more popular in densely populated states. While Taylor Swift is more popular by state size, the states she is popular in are not highly populated; whereas the East Coast is. The claim that can be made is the Rihanna is number 2 because she is popular in more densely populated states.",

Drake also seems to have that issue being ranked 13 and still falling short on the popularity scale to Taylor Swift.What might be occurring on the graph is African American artist being compared to Caucasian artists. Given that Rihanna and Drake are similar in genre of music, they are being compared to Taylor Swift who in 2012 was labeled a country singer at the time and Luke Bryan who is still a present country singer.

It is very strange why most southerners would not listen to country artists like Taylor Swift and Luke Bryan, yet in a way, it makes a lot of sense considering most of the southern states listen to Rihanna where there is a higher percentage of African-Americans. Stereotypes are all around we should not expect certain people in certain ares to listen to a specific type of music.",

You will also notice in the graph that the Southwest listened to mostly drake while the mid-west is all about Taylor swift. Luke Bryan is also popular in the mid-west which makes sense because Taylor and Luke both started out within the same origin of music. Rihannas fan base is very  distant  from the others which is located in the south-east.",

Rihanna and Drake are know for their Pop/Hip-Hop songs, so they both seem to be popular in the Southern portion of the US. Their popularity moves up the East coast, going all the way up to the New York area. Taylor Swift and Luke Bryan, known for their country music, tend to be more popular in the Mid-West and places like Kentucky and Tennessee. Another thing that could cause this is the races most prevalent in each area. In the area where Rihanna and Drake are poupular artist, there is a more diverse population. In the areas where Taylor Swift and Luke Bryan are popular, there is a whiter population. The whiter the population, the more popular the country stars are.",

However, some regions may be more densely populated than others, so I wonder if that effects how it appears.\n- Two of the artists, Rihanna and Drake, are POC and make hip-hop/rap/r&b music, and two of the artists, Taylor and Luke, are white and make country music.\n- Rihanna appears to be more popular in the North East coast area and around Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas. Taylor Swift appears more popular in Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada and Colorado. She almost appears to have an inverse popularity of Rihanna\u2019s. Where she is popular, Rihanna is not and vice versa.\n- Drake appears more popular in Nevada, California, Southern Texas and North East coast area. Luke Bryan appears more popular in Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia. Again, Luke Bryan appears to be popular inversely to where Drake is popular.\n- Rihanna is popular in Democrat states in North East but also in some Republican states in the South. Taylor is popular mostly in Republican states, Drake is popular mostly in Democrat states and Luke is popular mostly in Republican states.\n\nI wonder:\n- What characteristics of an artist makes them popular in one region and not another? And do people listen to artists that they can relate to more?\n- What impacts an artists popularity? Music genre? Race?",

In the spots where Rihanna's graph is dark purple, Taylor's same location spots are white. \n\nI wonder why in some states, such as Nevada, and on some graphs, such as Drake's, only one small section is different shade from the rest of the states. \n\nThe story these graphs are telling is that different regions of the country listen to different genres of music and most regions are in the same shade range, which means it is either very popular and not very popular.",

It definitely should not be like this but our world today has taken on these ways. I think this because Taylor Swift, who is ranked 18, has more views on YouTube than Rihanna, who is ranked 2.",

These details imply that more people would rather listen in rap and pop music than counrty and rihanna.\n2. I wonder why people have to keep count on how many people watch a certain artist. I am curious about this because the artist make it look like a competition for who can get the most views and etc.\n3. The story these graphs are telling is that if more people watch Luke Bryan on youtube then he gets a lot of views and gets to continue rising to be the top music artist in the world. You could also notice that people votedor wartched their music videos so that they could grow and make it to the top fifty artist. With the help of other pele we continue to help the artist grow and learn more about what they can do with their talent.",
