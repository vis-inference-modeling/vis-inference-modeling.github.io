What factors determine the rates of euthanization and adoption? Are the factors the same? \n\nCatchy headline: Lucky Dog: A Look at Outcomes for Dallas Shelter Animals",

Then also its showing the amount that were returned to their owner or that also been rescued. Adoption numbers are increasing, which is so good because you see more of the animals having homes. But my question is why in 2009 did people adopt more pets than instead of earlier?",

This could be due to individual events that happened to cause such drastic changes.

Another thing to notice is the amount of animals being euthanized is on a steady decline. Pet stores are now selling more shelter animals as opposed to purebred.

Overall, the downward trend is due to a decrease in animals going to this Dallas shelter. This can be attributed to movies like A Dog's Purpose and the cost of pet food. The sudden increase of pets in 2017 is due to Hurricane Harvey. The hurricane did not hit Dallas, and so, animals from shelters in the area that was hit were transferred to other shelters around the country (and even more so through the state). As a result, people were moved to adopt more sad, poor animals homeless by the hurricane. We wonder why there was an increase in animals who were released and what that means. We also are curious to know what this graph would look like today. Would there be an increase in adoptions? Would there be a decrease in animals arriving to the shelter?

In more recent years, most likely due to animal adoption and rescue awareness, more cats and dogs have been returned to their owners or adopted. Because of the surplus of adoption, there have been less animals euthanized than in past years.",

Other things that are notable could be the increase of released animals starting from 2014 and the spike and fall of transferring animals to rescue from 2017 to 2018. We wonder if these things could be affected by weather outbreaks and modern social influences. Outbreaks of tornadoes and hurricanes could affect the population levels entering into the Dallas animal services because of the destruction of houses. The destruction brought with these natural disasters could misplace thousands of animals from their homes. The loss of their owner's life during these events could also be attributed to this as well. This could explain the spike in population as well as the rise in the returning rate. Modern entertainment, such as movies could affect this as well, such as the release of the movie \"A Dog's Purpose\" in 2016. Movies similar to the previous one could influence the viewers to make the decision to adopt as well as influence society to be open to rescuing animals.",

These points are symbolized with the blue representing animals that were euthanized, the dark blue line representing animals that have been lost, died, or released, and the tan color representing animals that have been adopted or transferred. The y-axis represents the amount of animals in the shelters and the x-axis represents the year. I wonder what might have caused these results, and why the statistics for both cats and dogs have been grouped together? Maybe as time passed more awareness for dogs and cats in shelters has been raised and therefore adoption rates have increased.

However, regardless of the year, very little dogs or cats were released. If this graph is linear, then the trendline shows that soon there will be no need to Euthanize. I wonder if this is only a problem in Dallas, or if there used to be so many killing of dogs and cats elsewhere.",

In the case of the latter, I think it might be interesting to know why.",
