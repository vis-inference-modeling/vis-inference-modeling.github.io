In fact, the brutal heat continued day after day last year. According to my junior high school Japanese teacher, temperatures over 30 degrees were extremely rare when he was a child. \n2. I wonder why the average temperature during summer rose rapidly. I think the various developments around the world worsened global warming.  I also wonder why the data showed a wider range of temperature differences for about 30 years. \n3. If the average temperature in summer continues to rise, many people will get heat stroke. Especially, there are many elderly people in Akita, where I live, so the preventive measures should be necessary. \n4. Catchy Headline : Protect Ourselves From Extreme Heat!",

The frequency of extremely hot summers as gone from barely any to making up a significant portion of the total years sampled. The summers are also more varied. In the 1951-1980 graph, the summers are very concentrated at one peak, but that peak turns into more of a hill with how spread the temperatures are. It also appears that the entire first standard deviation or so from the mean fits into the hot section of the graph, instead of being centered over the normal. I do wonder how many degrees of temperature away from normal is considered extreme. Is it +- 5\u00b0c? +- 1\u00b0c? The graph calling it \"Extremely hot\" or \"Extremely cold\" could be mostly sensationalism. But I agree that the temps have been getting hotter.

One of those being how much the graph has moved over to Extreme heat and moved farther away from the cold. This will indicate that the heat will most likely continue to rise in the extreme rather than the cold. One thing I was wondering about was how far can the extreme heat move over before the cold temp is completely gone. This is a big problem for me and my community considering I live somewhere where it is mainly winter for most of the year and that's what my town is used too so taking that away and having hotter years rather than colder and really cause a big change. For my headline I would make it would sound something like \" Extreme cold to Extreme hot\" I feel like this is pretty straight forward but also the change from being cold to being hot is a big crisis not just for me and my town but also for the world as a whole.",

From 1951-1980, the distribution of summer temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere was approximately normally distributed with the majority of days within the \u201cnormal\u201d temperature range. However from 2013-2023, the graph has drastically shifted to the right with the majority of days in the \u201chot\u201d and \u201cextremely hot\u201d temperature categories. This graph is right skewed. The first graph spans over 29 years while the second only shows data from a ten year period. I wonder, if the graphs were created on a ten year basis (for example, 1991-2001, 2002-2012, 2013-2023) would the graphs change as dramatically? I wonder what major inventions have led to this climate change? Could it include farming, cars, increased production? I wonder, is this data reflected similarly from other nations? Does this data match that of the southern hemisphere? I also am wondering, what specific temperatures constitute the categories \u201ccold, normal, hot, and extremely hot\u201d? As a New Hampshire resident, this directly impacts me and my community through our climate. The data shows summer temperatures of the Northern Hemisphere are increasingly warming up, impacting our lives in the summer.

The extreme temperatures go from being very minuscule, thin tails of the graph to the extremely hot temperatures nearing half of the data and frequency. The cold temperatures die out, changing from \u2153 of the frequency to an outlier amount of data. Another graphic that stood out to me was the color-coded map of temperature change over the Northern Hemisphere. The red extreme heat along the equator and mediterranean plus almost the entirety of the United States and Europe in abnormal yellow hot temperatures contrasts with the temperature map of 1951, showing yellow only in the desert regions of the United States and along the equator. \nI wonder how it would look to show the change in frequency of winter temperatures. \nOur area deals with heatwaves and other effects of climate change, like flooding and big storms, and our infrastructure and natural environment cannot handle the changing climate. The trend of the standard distribution of temperatures rising so significantly from 1951-2023 shows a disturbing rate of change and projected future.\nI would title the graph: \u201cRising Temperatures and Rising Climate Concerns.\u201d",

The 2013-2023 data demonstrates how the temperatures have frequently become extremely hot.

    "comment info": "1. I noticed that in the graph that summer temperatures have drastically changed in the sense that summers have gotten significantly hotter. In years 1951-1980 the temperature was roughly distributed normal throughout June-July- August in the Northern Hemisphere while in 2013-2023 the graph has shifted to the right meaning that temperature has gotten hotter. \n2. If the temperature in the future keeps rising, what can we expect for future generations? How much will temperatures rise if nothing is done? Why, in my opinion, isn't anything being done to at least lower temperatures? \n3. Even though it's only May, the temperatures are already rising, thus this is important to me and my community. Summer is coming. These heated, intense temperatures that are becoming higher every year are probably going to make this summer the hottest one yet. \n4. The World's on Fire",

In the first graph displaying the temperatures from 1951-1980, I noticed that normal temperatures were the most frequent, cold and hot temperatures were about the same frequency, and extremely hot temperatures were at a very low frequency. I wonder what temperatures are considered normal and how that is determined. However, when looking at the other graph measuring the temperature during years 2013-2023, I noticed a significant difference in the temperatures in comparison to the first graph. For example, the most frequent temperature was hot, the normal temperature\u2019s frequency significantly decreased, and the extremely hot temperature\u2019s frequency increased significantly whereas the cold temperature decreased. I wonder why this trend occurred and think that is caused by global warming. This relates to my community because I have noticed temperatures rising more and more and climate change is definitely a very prevalent issue.

    "comment info": "These graphs show how the average summer land temperatures across the northern hemisphere have changed over the past 72 years (1951-2023). In the first graph (1951-1980), it is apparent that normal temperatures occur most often. However, cold and hot temperatures are both still very frequent and their frequencies are just about equal. Extremely cold and extremely hot temperatures are very rare during this time period. In the second graph (2013-2023) cold and even normal temperatures become significantly less frequent than they once were, and extremely cold temperatures are very rare. On the other hand, hot temperatures become more frequent, and extremely hot temperatures which were basically nonexistent in the first graph become much more common. I wonder why the graphs are such different shapes. The first graph is very high and narrow while the second graph is lower and wider. I can infer that this difference in temperatures is due to the range of the data because the second graph has a wider range of temperatures included in it. I wonder if climate change will continue to progress until the majority of temperatures are extremely hot. What will we do to stop this from happening? \n\"You Are Going to Need More than a Fan this Summer\"",

    "comment info": "I notice that average summer temperatures in Northern Hemisphere have increased significantly since the 1950s. Over a mere ten year period (2013-2023), the average summer temperature rose to be in the \"hot\" rather than \"normal\" range. Interestingly, the graphs have also changed in terms of distribution. The data points are more extreme, leading to a wider curve. Also, the Northern Hemisphere now experiences \"extremely hot\" weather, when from 1951-1980 this was virtually nonexistent. \n\nI wonder if climate change has precipitated these changes. Anthropogenic activity is known to cause more extreme weather patterns, so I am curious if the wide distribution of temperature from 2013-2023 has the same cause. I also wonder if \"normal\" temperatures are in the context of the Earth's history, or simply 1951-1980. Is it normal for the preindustrial era, too?\n\nThis relates to me and my community because rising summer temperatures makes the Northern Hemisphere less hospitable, especially for those with existing medical conditions. If extremely hot temperatures persist, people might be encouraged to migrate toward the cooler poles. Rising temperatures could also hurt species diversity, as natives might not be able to survive in different conditions.\n\n\"A Midsummer Night's HEAT\"",

In 2013-2023 the average temperatures were hot. There was a staggering difference in how often it was extremely hot between the two graphs. I wonder what temperatures are considered average, hot, etc. The graph does not denote numbers, so it is possible the margin in the temperatures is narrow.

For example, picking the average of 7 days to represent the temperature of the whole week. Because numbers are not shown, there is a lot of room to speculate.

    "comment info": "These graphs illustrate the temperatures during the summer months in the northern hemisphere. It is shown in the shape of a bell curve, showing the distribution of temperatures across the graph. In the top graph, spanning 1951-1980, the mean temperatures are in the normal range, an average temperature, with some outliers being on the cooler and hotter side. In the second graph, the bell curve is skewed with the mean temperatures mostly falling under the hot category. This graph covers 2013-2023, and so one can conclude that this is because of global warming. If the average temperature in more modern days has risen that much as compared to the base period, we can deduce that it is a standard trend. This relates to me because I live in the northern hemisphere, and global warming has an impact across the globe for all people regarding food, water, energy sources, and more. I would title this graph \u201cGlobal Warming: HOT.\u201d",

Looking at the graphs we can see this clearly as the graph from 1951-1980 is more centered and has no tails while the graph from 2013-2023 has a left tail and therefore is skewed to the left, which in this case it means more hot temperatures during the summer.\n\n2) I wonder the extent global warming has been affecting these higher temperatures during the summer and what this means moving forward as our planet becomes hotter and hotter.

In the second graph showing the temperatures for 2013-2023, the graph had a peak in the hot temperature range and around \u2154 of the temperatures for that time period were within the extremely hot range. I noticed that as more years passed, the hotter the days got during the summertime. I wonder where in the Northern Hemisphere these temperatures were recorded, because there is a difference in temperatures during the summer months in New England compared to somewhere like Florida or Texas. I would also wonder what role climate change has had on these temperatures and if there are any correlations between the increasing temperatures during certain summers and the rate of climate change. I also wonder what the graphs define as a \u201cnormal\u201d, \u201cextremely hot\u201d, \u201chot\u201d,  or \u201ccold\u201d temperature. There is no numerical value provided for each category, just a description which can be interpreted differently by each person. With rising temperatures each summer this can have an impact on the environment and the people. With the rising temperatures this can change rainfall patterns which impacts the plants and animals around us during the summer.

In communities around the world, extreme heat events can pose health risks, such as the elderly, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions. Rising temperatures can also exacerbate issues like drought, water scarcity, and wildfires, impacting agriculture, biodiversity, and overall ecosystem health. Additionally, warmer temperatures can contribute to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, leading to sea level rise and coastal erosion, which threatens coastal communities and infrastructure. Addressing the impacts of rising temperatures requires concerted efforts at both local and global levels, including mitigation strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation measures to build resilience to the changes already underway.\nClimate Change is Going to Kill Us All!",

It would mean that the hottest days of today didn't even exist back then. The extremely cold category also reaches out a little further in the 2013-2023 graph, meaning there's some evidence that even the coldest days of today were a little worse than before. \nI wonder if 30 years before the 1951-1980 base period were any cooler. It might help provide some context to the graph we see. I imagine prior to 1951 wasn't that much cooler, but it would still be nice to see it compared to 1951-1980. Another thing I wonder is why the data collected was only in the Northern Hemisphere. Was it too difficult to also collect similar data in the Southern Hemisphere during the base period?\nThis relates to me personally since as the days get hotter in our modern world we all generally suffer more for it. The extremely hot days mean were more at risk for dangerous wildfires (and other fires) since the majority of terrain is so dry for a long period of the year due to the extreme heat. We have to think of ways to adapt in order to cope with the fact our world is hotter.

    "comment info": "I notice from the graphs that the frequency of \"normal\" temperatures has severely decreased in the last 72 years. I've noticed that what was considered a hot average temperature from 1951-1980 has now become what is the norm in the Northern Hemisphere. I also noticed that there is much more variability in the graph now. In the base period the temperatures were heavily centered at the normal temperature with small tails on both sides. While in the modern plot the ranges of temperatures is much greater with a very large right tail insinuating that there are much higher temperatures now than there was then. \n\nI wonder why the shape of the plot has changed and not just the temperatures itself. Knowing about global warming and the production of fossil fuels, the temperature increase does not surprise me but the idea that the distributions are different shapes is puzzling. I wonder if that can be attributed to exponential growth. I also wonder how the Northern Hemisphere compares to the southern hemisphere and if there are similar trends there or if possibly they are opposite trends. \n\nThis relates to my community because from a few environmental classes I've taken, I learned that this massive temperature increase is putting a lot of nature at risk and making habitats and species die. As someone who loves to travel and see nature it is important to me that the animals and plants around us are being taken care of by us. \n\nTitle: \"Got AC?

The next thing I noticed was how the graph started to shift from a visibily normal graph to one that was skewed right. I think that is also important to note that as the graph's peak moves from normal to hot, it also lowers, indicating more that temperatures are varying more. So while colder temperatures are becoming less common, the range of the temperatures is increasing, which tells you just how fast extreme temperatures are on the rise. Something that I wonder is if this animated graph would be similar for the years 1900-1950. I wonder if temperatures were always on the rise like this. \nThis information affects the entire world, and thus also my community.

The graph displaying the Northern Hemisphere temperatures from 1951-1980 appears to follow a normal distribution, where cold and hot temperatures seem to be evenly distributed on both sides. However, the graph below showing the temperatures from 2013-2023 has a right skewed distribution with hot and extremely hot temperatures taking up most of the graph. This indicates just how quickly temperature is evolving to be hotter and hotter and will continue to do so over time.\n\n2. Something I wonder is what we can do to slow down these rapidly increasing temperatures. For example, if everyone switched to only driving electric cars or even\u00a0having hybrid cars, how quickly would we see the results of its impact on the environment?\u00a0\n\n3.

It also seems that the frequency of both normal and cold temperatures has decreased. The animated graph helps provide a clear understanding of the noticeable shift in temperature distribution compared to the baseline from 1951 to 1980. One thing that may provide better insight into the story behind the graph, is including the temperature ranges for each temperature category.  This would provide an understanding of how certain temperatures are classified. \n\nThis graph leads me to wonder about the northern hemisphere's winter temperature distribution. I wonder if extreme winter and storm weather caused by climate change have resulted in a stronger skew in the distribution towards a larger frequency of cold and extremely cold temperatures. This graph provides concern for the future of climate change, as it does not appear the shift is slowing down.

Back in the 1950s to 1980s, the temperature distribution was like a symphony, with most of the notes clustered around the \"Normal\" range. It felt like summers followed a predictable rhythm during that era. But fast forward to 2013-2023, and it's like the music has changed entirely. The peak has shifted to \"Hot,\" and there's this long, drawn-out crescendo reaching into \"Extremely hot\" temperatures. It's like summers have become more unpredictable, with heatwaves becoming the new norm.\n\nI wonder what's behind this dramatic shift. What's causing this sudden change in temperature patterns? Is it something we're doing, or is it nature's own rhythm? I'm also curious about how different parts of the Northern Hemisphere are experiencing these changes. Are some places feeling the heat more intensely than others?\n\nThis shift to hotter summers has real consequences for us because it means farmers might struggle with crops, and we might find ourselves cranking up the air conditioning more often, leading to higher electricity bills.

However, as the time periods move further, the distribution of summer temperatures start centering moving toward \u201chot\u201d temperatures. I wonder what \u201ccold\u201d, \u201cnormal\u201d, \u201chot\u201d, etc. temperatures actually are. Are they measured in degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius? What do \u201cnormal\u201d temperatures mean? As someone who is definitely concerned about the effects of global warming, this graphic really scares me! With land temperatures increasing, who knows what will happen to our world, namely our biodiversity. Especially in California! This state is one of the most diverse regions in both abiotic and biotic realms. What dangers does California face with these increasing temperatures? I just wonder what people in my community and myself can do in this situation, especially since this change in temperatures is mostly due to the acceleration in greenhouse gas emissions specifically from larger corporations.

This depicts the increase in variability of Summer temperatures and indicates an upward trend with Summer temperatures. While the focus of the graph is on increasing temperatures, it is interesting to note that within the 1991-2001 period there is an increase in the amount of extremely cold temperatures. I would like to know the temperature scale used to create each category. Moreover, I wonder about the effect of the overwhelming increase of extremely hot temperatures on day to day life as this graph introduces a larger conversation about global warming. This affects me and my community in terms of wildfires. As the temperature increases for longer periods of time, the risk of the dry brush catching fire also increases. I remember in high school we were not allowed to eat outside during lunch and even had class canceled due to heavy smoke from wildfires.

The distribution follows a normal curve, yet the extremely hot period is experienced in 2013-2023 year-slice is the highest across years with the cold slice drastically reduced. The frequency of the temperature has also reduced with the new entrant category - extremely hot. The visual also indicates that before 1991, the mean/median temperature  was 'normal' and now is in the hot category (new normal).\nI wonder if these measurements are taken at the same geo-location, at the same spot (with/without tree coverage), every time at the specified time (always say at 11am), across the years, in the indicated months. What instruments were used to capture and the metric adopted. What is the benchmark of cold, normal, hot and extremely hot. How did we manage to get the same number (assumption) of data points at each of these locations across years.\nIt is important to understand the landscape changes, the foliage coverage, the habitation growth, the construction/developments, usage of glass/solar panels/tar/cement in the vicinity etc, presence/absence/disappearance of water bodies - that have contributed to the rise in the temperature.

As opposed to the older time frame, a large majority of the summer temperatures now are hot or extremely hot. This is especially noticeable with the \u201cextremely hot\u201d category. Additionally, there is a lot of variability in the distribution of summer temperatures now rather than 70 years ago. Where the older period\u2019s distribution is more steep and tall, the current period\u2019s distribution is shorter and wider.\nMy question is what is the scale of temperature in this graph? The first graph is used as the \u201cbaseline\u201d to determine what temperature is considered \u201cnormal\u201d and the other categories. Due to this, it is easy to tell category differences but what is the actual range of these categories? Knowing the temperatures considered \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201ccold\u201d would help contextualize this graph for readers.\nSince climate change has been a very important topic in recent media, showing actual data about how it is affecting temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere provides clear evidence of global warming's effects on us. As someone concerned about global warming issues, seeing how significantly the temperatures have been increasing over the past 70 years is incredibly worrying and makes the necessity of finding solutions to slow down this issue blatantly obvious.\nTitle: \u201cCan We Beat The Heat?

For the graph between 1951-1980, the graph appears to be normally distributed around normal temperature, with the tails barely in the extremely hot and extremely cold. But for the  2013-2023 graph, we can see it is skewed right, having a larger portion to the right of the mean, or hotter than the average, than the colder side. I also noticed that the peak of the 2013-2023 graph is shorter than the 1951-1980 graph. This makes me wonder whether or not the amount of years comes into play for the height. Since the 1951-1980 graph includes 29 years and the 2013-2023 graph only includes 10 years, it would make sense that if they included the same amount of years, the graphs would be similar heights. This graphic relates to my community in that we are on the forefront of innovation, but we are also the next generation to try and solve climate change.

    "comment info": "The thing I notice is that this is the most effective visualization I have seen since looking at these graphs. The dark red getting more prevalent in the gif as time goes on is extremely striking. Further, the shift from a pretty normal distribution in 1951 to the right skew in 2013 is jarring. These two elements combined make this graph incredibly effective at portraying how summer temperatures have gotten hotter.\n\nI wonder why this was limited to the Northern Hemisphere. The largest reason I can think of is that most NYT readers are likely in the United States, if not the Northern Hemisphere. However, from what I know this is a global issue. I know that summer in Australia and Brazil have also been getting much hotter. When clicking the citation, the data is available for the whole globe.  Was this done to make the visualization more striking? Was it done by NYT editors to keep their readers in mind?\n\nThis relates to me and my community as I can anecdotally verify the truth of this. I am from Los Angeles and throughout high school I worked at a day camp and my last two years were marked by extreme heat advisories. It would be so hot, that it was literally unsafe for us to bring our campers outside for anything besides going in the pool. This graph serves a powerful way to convey my experience to people from other parts of North America which are not subject to this extreme heat.\n\nHeadline: \u201cSpicy Summers, We\u2019re All Feeling Them!\u201d",

In comparison, the temperatures from 2013-2023 seemed to be far more right skewed. I also noticed that while the higher temperatures have gotten more extreme while temperatures on the cold end stay in the same range. \n\nI wonder what temperature ranges correspond to \"normal\", \"Hot\", \"extra hot\" , etc,. The lack of specific temperature ranges make the graph harder to contextualize. Additionally, it makes it easier to be interpreted differently across viewers. I like the movement part of the graph. You can easily see the movement of the distribution across the years because the graph keeps the original data shaded in. \n\nThis relates to me and my community because we are all affected by these higher temperatures, whether we acknowledge them or not. The higher temperatures can be dangerous in California especially because of the risk of fires and drought.\n\nGraph Title: \"Temperature Trends Overtime\"",

    "comment info": "The first thing that I noticed about this graph is that temperatures are rapidly increasing over time. In the first graph that is showing summer temperatures from 1951 to 1980, there is barely any red in the visual indicating extremely hot temperatures. However, there is a very large portion of the visual for 2013-2023 showing extremely hot temperatures, indicating that summer temperatures are increasing over time. The 2013 to 2023 time frame also has an alarmingly low portion of the graph that has normal or cold temperatures-- extreme values are much more common. I wonder what the actual temperatures are recorded on the x-axis. What temperature exactly qualifies as \"extremely hot\", and how does that compare to my own perception of what is \"hot\" or \"cold\"? This graph relates to me and my community because the topic of global warming is widely discussed today, and is becoming an increasingly pressing issue. As a young adult, I am part of the community that will be inheriting the world as we know it, and it is our job to take care of the planet that we live on before we cause even further destruction. I myself have noticed more extreme weather than I did when I was a little kid, 100 degree days are much more common than they used to be. Additionally, in California we have experienced severe droughts more often than we should. A catchy headline for this graph would be \"It's Getting Hot in Here- Rising Temperatures Over Time\".",

The most common temperature occurrences have decreased notably in frequency, and the temperature distribution curve appears broader and flatter. I'm curious about the specific temperatures represented on the x-axis. Notably, around a third of temperatures recorded between 2013 and 2023 fall within the \"extremely hot\" range, which raises significant concerns. Having a clear understanding of the temperature range would help lead to better interpretations of the data overall in my opinion. This data affects me and my community because the impacts of global warming are widespread and affect us all. I can personally attest to experiencing things such as over 100 degree temperatures as well as severe droughts in my hometown throughout my lifetime. These prove to be just a couple of things that contribute to global warming and how out-of-control it has become.\nHeadline: \"Rising Temperatures: A Planet in Flames\"",

    "comment info": "I noticed that over time summer temperatures have increased drastically. More specifically we observe how from 1951 to 2023 the changes in the frequency of different temperatures and the hotter temperatures are now more common. Since 1951 the most frequent among the Summer temperatures from June to August in the Northern Hemisphere was a normal temperature. However, in the present day that's changed to a hot temperature. Then in regards to the extremes back in 1951-1980, both extremely hot and extremely cold were such small portions of the graphic. In the present day both of these extremes have changed the extremely cold portion has managed to get smaller while Extremely hot has become a significant portion of the summer temperatures even becoming the second most common temperature. I wonder what many effects have contributed to this significant increase in Summer Temperatures. I would also like to know how these temperatures were recorded since it's not said by the graphic and whether it's taking the averages. This graphic can show effectively just how significant the increase in temperature has been over the past 72 years. It is a sign of concern for Earth's inhabitants as it shows past trends and ultimately gets you thinking of future trends. It makes you think of how dire the situation of global warming is and how we need to act now to try and prevent such increases from continuing.
