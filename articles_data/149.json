Prior to 1921, a significant majority of the immigrant population was European. In 1921, however, Congress imposed national-origin quotas. These policy changes seemed to drastically lower the number of new immigrants, and diversified them slightly. In 1965, President LBJ ended these quotas and immigration rose. After the 1970s, the percentage of immigrants that were European drastically shrunk and Latin American immigrants became the most common. I wonder what caused the immigration quotas to be passed and later repealed, and if there are any concerns over quotas currently. The second graph shows how the immigrant population has changed in each county across America. There seems to be less growth in the northernmost parts of the country, and the most growth in the southeast and midwest.

It's interesting to see how the vast majority of immigrants were Europeans, and how that started to decrease, and now the majority of immigrants are Latin Americans or Asians. The reason there were so many European immigrants pre and during 1920s was because many of them were leaving their countries to come live and work in the United States, being sold to the idea of the American Dream (ie Ellis Island).

I also notice that after Lyndon B.

I wonder how the different legislations brought about such a significant change? Perhaps the reason for this could be that the quota system decreased the amount of immigrants allowed to come into the country. Once it was lifted, there was a surge in immigration to the US again leading to more foreign-born. Possible Title:\"Immigration Nation: Percentages of the Foreign-Born from 1880 to the 2000s.\"",

It is important to mention that the percentage of foreign born populations almost reached the previous 1880s overall percentage. I also noticed the 40 year-long impact of the Congress imposed national-origin quotas in the progressive decline of the foreign born populations. \n\nI wonder what are the reasons behind the super small amount of Latin America & Asian populations living in US from 1880s to 1921s (taken into account that  with the quotas imposed in 1921 we could not expect an increase of those populations in the incoming years) in comparison to that of European origin, and also I am especially curious  about why if Latin America is closer to US in those previous years that population was relatively small in comparison to that from Europe.

        "comment info": "@Maureen Fonken Thank you for letting us know. Ads are supposed to be removed from The Learning Network. I've made a request to find out why ads are sometimes appearing. Hopefully the issue will be resolved quickly. Sometimes readers see things that we don't see, so it's always helpful when you let us know about things like this.
