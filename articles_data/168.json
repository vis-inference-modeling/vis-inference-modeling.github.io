The highest producer of greenhouse gas was electricity until just before 2017. It had previously almost reached 2.5 billion metric tons. Currently, transportation is the highest producer, followed by electricity, industry, and agriculture. Within transportation, passenger vehicles and trucks produce the most gas. In the graph measuring total production, the number of metric tons has gone down after increasing in the 2000s. The amount produced by transportation also decresed before 2017 but has since gone up. I wonder why the amount of greenhouses gases has decreased overall, especially why electricity has decreased do much.

    "comment info": "Notice: I notice that while many people think that cattle is a major source of methane, a major greenhouse gas, much of the greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere come from transportation in the industry, specifically coming from things such as large trucks, trains, planes, and simply passenger vehicles in general. Plus over time the gas emissions have increased.\n\nWonder: I wonder what we could do to fix the greenhouse gas problem while still having a successful, and thriving economy, because in today\u2019s world everything\u2019s all about money even if It means destroying the very planet that we live on today.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?: \nThe graph is showing the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions, and how it has increased from 1990-2017, and what areas come from such as transportation .",

I wonder if this lack of change in the transportation industry is because more attention in regards to climate change and the emission of greenhouse gases is often focused on those other industries, and the actual adverse impact of transportation emissions is minimized by mainstream media coverage due to the ties and influence that many automobile corporations possess.",

I wonder if the cause for the drop in transportation emissions correlates with a peak in electric emissions, potentially electric cars played a role or there was a larger emphasis placed on electric energy for a short period of time. The second graph on the right shows the transportation emissions by each mode of transportation, this reveals that the leading contributor in transportation emissions are passenger vehicles.
