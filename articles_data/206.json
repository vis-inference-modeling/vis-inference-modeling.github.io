Why were there no numbers on the dashed lines?  What\u2019s going on in Asia?\n\nYou had many catchy headlines including Katie of Eden Prairie, MN whose headline had a double entendre \"Migration in Millions: How the World Moves\".  Good noticing and wondering leads to snappy headlines.\n\nThanks to all teachers and students who responded.  You can continue to post responses. Talk to your classmates and read the moderators\u2019 replies. Dig deeper into what the graph shows.  Perhaps you will find more things to notice, wonder, claim or conjecture. Please check back on Thursday afternoon, September 13 to see the Reveal with a link to the original New York Times article, some questions about the graph, and two Stat Nuggets. And join us next Wednesday, September 19 for the next \"What's Going On In This Graph?\".  I think it might possibly have to do with fast food restaurants, unless we have a Hurricane Florence graph.
