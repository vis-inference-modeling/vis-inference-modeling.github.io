The goal for having a vaccine tested, produced, and ready for distribution by August 2021 doesn\u2019t even take into account any potential setbacks, which would probably be even more likely since scientists aren\u2019t able to spend the proper amount of time researching everything. Even things like building factories to produce a vaccine aren\u2019t as simple as they seem because every factory has to be specialized for that specific type of vaccine, which makes the process take even longer. At every step where the process is shortened, you can see the sacrifices we have to make to get this vaccine. Many phase trials are being conducted at the same time, without even knowing if the vaccine is going to pass the first trial. The vaccine is going to be distributed to some important front-line and essential workers before it even gets approved by the FDA. If we do get a vaccine produced in this time period, there is no way it is as safe and effective as if we had waited 16 years and completed all the steps properly. \n\nThere is no question that we need a vaccine for this virus, and can\u2019t afford to wait 16+ years, but we also can\u2019t speed up the process so much that it potentially does more harm than good.",

Of course, it would be lots of good publicity (and possibly a decent profit) to be the first to make a vaccine, but ultimately, the bottom line is king.Trying to speed up the drug development process could be very expensive and have a lot of associated risks. For example, what if you start clinical trials too early, and your vaccine makes a patient seriously ill. Is the drug company on the hook for that? Are they going to be sued?

Everyone would be tripping over themselves to get everything done in the specified amount of time, inevitably causing setbacks when things don't line up correctly, or if something gets done before something else was meant to get done and they have to go back and do it again because they didn't do it right according to the first task. Also, if they start manufacturing before finishing phase three, there'll be more accidents. Why should we streamline the process at the cost of lives?

Before the reveal, I thought that the first graph was realistic as well because it showed a huge difference in success of the vaccine between phases.

There are large percentages of error for the phases of the drug trials, but when you look at the accelerated timeline, you can see that building factories and manufacturing happens while that's still going on. I wonder if this accelerated, overlapping timeline could lead to a waste in resources, if suddenly they find that a drug is unsafe or ineffective, and suddenly they have to scrap a large amount of work because they didn't take the necessary time needed to effectively create a vaccine.

They're attempting to cut the process of making and distributing a vaccine down to a year could lead to it not being as effective as possible.

A drug/vaccine that will be put into so many people should have many phases to ensure it\u2019s safety. It is also understandable that the percentage of failure could be pretty high in some phases. It\u2019s better if it fails during testing rather than during distribution. However, as I look at the second graph, I am concerned. Everybody is looking for a quick cure for the Coronavirus, but the graph makes it very clear that a quick cure is simply a dream. It takes a lot of time to make a vaccine. By the time trials for the vaccine begin, it\u2019ll be sometime between 2024-2026. And, the vaccine always has a chance of failing during trials, especially phase two which has a probability of 69% for failing. The predicted time for a cure is May, 2036. That is a long 16 years which is why scientists are somehow finding a way to make a cure in just 1 year. All I can wonder is, how? The coronavirus could mutate and change, so how can we make a cure so fast? And, will we just have to make a new vaccine as time goes by? Will it even be as effective and safe as a vaccine that took on the process for 16 long years?",

With each phase, the unsuccessful drags are dropped and the remaining ones go unto the even more rigorous next phase.  Here is how you calculate the percentage that get final approval.  \n\nStart with 100 trial drugs  If 37% fail the Phase I trial, how many move onto the Phase II trial?   Then, take this number of drugs that passed the Phase I trial and put them through the Phase II trials.  How many make it through the Phase II trial?   Do the same for Phase III and the Application process.  How many of the original 100 drugs get approved by the FDA?  Now, divide this number by the original 100 drugs and you have the percent that historically get approved.  What\u2019s is this percentage?  \n\nRight now, there are 254 therapies and 95 vaccines being explored.  Given the historical probabilities, how many could be effective and safe?

Why would we even worry about vaccine when the last pandemic, Spanish Flu, died out after about 6 months in the middle of World War I. Okay, yes people died but it helped control the population. That's why I think pandemics happen to control how many people we have so the world doesn't get overpopulated. We needed a pandemic anyway we have had one about every 100 years, so we need to just let this happen. Honestly when it started we should have just quarantined china when it started in October. What we really need to do is just have people lock us in our homes for four weeks and call it. Like that's the only way there going to be able to fix this. But, who's to say that the government wants us to not get it. Maybe they don't care, maybe they want us to get it. Also in December or January everyone got really sick will flu like symptoms but it wasn't the flu and we where all sick for a long time. Its like maybe we all ready got it and just know one cared until the government wanted to control us. Another thing is they want to get the vaccine in one and a half years, maybe they all ready have the vaccine being made because the government made COVID-19. In graph 1 it's about the phases for a new drug like, yeah of course your going to fail a lot before you get things right.  This is a lot but I had to say something about it.",

Therefore, this showed that it takes time, and in the second graph, it shows that it takes a while to get the research and make sure everything runs smoothly with the vaccine. However, in the third graph, it shows that the processes would be shortened, which could affect the outcome.

Will they have a chance to make one fast enough?",

        "comment info": "HI, @Tyreak --\n\nI wonder why you think that scientists are not trying hard enough to produce a vaccine.  As of May 3, there are 254 therapies and 95 vaccines being explored.  The real challenge is getting an effective and safe vaccine for a virus that we have never seen before (though SARS and MERS are comparable).  Please return tomorrow late afternoon when we will reveal the article that included these graphs and a very complete explanation of the steps and challenges of getting a vaccine to the public.  Also, there will be headline shout outs, additional questions and resources, and Stat Nuggets.  The interactive graphs that let you choose which streamlining options you want will give you insight in the tradeoffs for producing a vaccine.",

    "comment info": "-I noticed that the Covid-19 Vaccine Goal Timeline is much more compressed than the Typical Vaccine Timeline. This shows that the demand and necessity for a Covid-19 vaccine is incredibly high and scientists are doing everything they can in order to speed up the process of getting a vaccine distributed. \n-I wonder when a Covid-19 vaccine will actually be distributed, and if it will in fact be distributed by the goal of August 2021.\n-\"Deadly Virus Results in the Rapid Search for a Reliable Vaccine\"",

    "comment info": "I notice that normally, the vaccine steps occur one after another, but with the Covid-19 Vaccine, the graph is all squished together, and at one time, all three trials are being done at the same time. I also notice that a lot less research is being put into trying to find one. To me, this seems like a very bad idea, because less research may lead to a less effective vaccine than what might be possible.\n\nI wonder if by the expected completion time, August 2021, the idea of a vaccine will even be as pressing, because the pandemic will probably not be as bad as it is now. I also wonder why the manufacturing would occur before even the phase 1 trials are complete. This seems odd to me because if the vaccine that is being tested fails, then there will be a lot of manufactured vaccines that are completely useless.",

I'm also wondering what is meant by \"Building factories\" in this context. It seems also like distribution will take only a month or so. I wonder if that actually will be possible since so many people will need/want to be vaccinated once a vaccine is approved.",
