I enjoy this but I take issue with the fact that there is a monetary incentive for university programs to prioritize foreign student dollars, who have higher tuition, creating an international pipeline that take seats away from American born students. Second, I have seen the HB1 visa spectacularly abused. Executives and managers routinely across the peninsula bring over people it turns out the know from the past - maybe a friend from university days in India and other countries. Everyone wants to pack their work environment with people they trust, and they have a collective narrative that many native born are less uneducated, which is actually false.\nMusk so much as said that.\nIt is NEVER just about merit at these companies. It\u2019s about power, allegiance etc etc. It is also a complete fallacy that American universities aren\u2019t producing enough engineers (are you kidding me?) So look closely at the medium and high paying jobs in the coastal cities now, and who has them. It should be a subject of grave concern for immigrants themselves because they don\u2019t want their American born and educated children passed over either in the future.  American companies and non profits should offer jobs to Americans with preference, and prove it or pay massive fines.

To do this, February 2020 is the baseline and all worker data is compared to the February 2020 data.\n\nSo, what do you notice about the number of workers - native- and foreign-born before the February 2020 baseline and after the baseline?  (We shared additional information that was in the article, but not in the graph.)\n\nSuggest a graph that you think would better relate to how the number of native-born and foreign-born workers has changed from the start of the pandemic recession -- February 2020?\n\nQuestion:  Do you think 2,700,000 additional workers  is \"a slight increase\"?\n\nYou can return on Friday when we will reveal the free link to the article that includes this graph.

If this graph had y axis 0-100 the growth in number foreign workers would show as a small blip\n\nI agree this metric of percent foreign born x-year divide by 2020 baseline for these two groups is not the best metric\n\nA better graph would show total number workers on y axis. Would also show on y graph how many of each group are represented in our overall population. For instance, if number of foreign born people went from 18% to 20% of our population and their percent of workforce went from  18- 20%, nothing of interest.  However I suspect the percent of foreign workers employed is growing at higher rate than US born, thus reflecting the aging and retirement of US born while younger foreign born workers move here seeking employment. \n\nI also suspect a graph showing avg income of foreign born vs US born workers would not be alarming to nativists, as it would show many foreign born workers are in health care, agriculture, manufacturing where wages are low.  \n\nI\u2019d love to see percent of US executives who are foreign vs US born, and how their wage growth compares. 50 years ago CEOs made 21x more than avg worker, yet now make 290x more than avg workers. \n\nMy guess is higher paying jobs are still held at higher rates by US born workers, and immigrants are backfilling lower wage jobs that our lack of native population growth cannot fill.

That is a problem for a newspaper (this isn\u2019t a graph in a research paper read by experts). \n\nAs for a different kind of graph? Simply show the change in the percentage of workers who are foreign-born and those who are native-born (e.g., from 2020 to 2024: 82%/18% to 80%/20%). Not as dramatic but easy to interpret. I would also like to see data that goes farther back to slunderstand this in historic context. What was the percentage in 1920, for example? 1880? (If quality data exists.)\n\nAlso, as a couple of posters have commented, it would be more enlightening to see this broken down by industry. Where is the growth happening most quickly? Are there places where the trend is the opposite? Is it happening in technology companies, with college-educated technologists being brought in? low-paid jobs in agriculture or service industries? What about health care and at what level of service? (Nurses, aids, doctors?) \n\nSome answers to these questions can be found here:https://nfap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Immigrants-And-Americas-Labor-Force-Growth.DAY-OF-RELEASE.October-2024.pdf.

I also noticed that from 2020-2021, the amount of both foreign and native born workers were below 100%. This is due to the pandemic and many people being unable to go to work.  I wonder why the amount of foreign workers drastically increased from 2022 and on, while the native born workers stayed lower. I wonder if this is due to the large amount of immigrants who were foreign that came into our country and started to work. This relates to me and my community because I am a born American citizen who is currently working with a job, and to see the decline in American citizens in the workforce (shown in the graph), shows that it is very hard to find good jobs now a days.

The explanation below the graph points out that the \"graph displays separately the percentage difference in their number in the U.S. work force when compared to their baseline number in the work force in February 2020\".  So they are calling the number of foreign born workers in February 2020 \"100%\", and showing the numbers of workers at all the other times as a percentage of that February 2020 number.\n\nCan you think of some other examples you've seen where someone explains what \"one whole\" or \"one hundred percent\" is in their story?\n\nIt's worth making sure you talk about this with your classmates, because it's really helpful when trying to understand stories that people are trying to tell with numbers.",

However, foreign-born employment rebounded quickly and has now surpassed pre-pandemic levels, reaching 109% by 2024, while native-born employment has remained around 100%. Before the pandemic, native-born employment was relatively stable, whereas foreign-born employment was gradually increasing. Since 2021, the gap between the two groups has widened, with foreign-born workers experiencing much stronger job growth.\n2)I wonder what factors contributed to the faster recovery of foreign-born workers compared to native-born workers. Were they more likely to take jobs in high-demand industries, or did labor shortages create more opportunities for them?\n3)New Jersey has a large immigrant population, so the strong job recovery among foreign-born workers may reflect local labor market trends, especially in industries like healthcare, transportation, and hospitality. \n4)Employment Rebound: How Foreign-Born Workers Took the Lead",

After that, there's another dip for the foreign born workers, but not much for native-born workers. For native born workers, they kept rising steadily in waves each year and season, and grew again after the dip during COVID. However, the foreign-born line varies a lot. They grew faster than native-born workers before COVID, and a lot faster after COVID. It\u2019s also interesting that the graph seems to have yearly patterns each year, especially clear in the native-born line.\nI wonder if the reason the second dip for foreigners is far lower than native born is because of some sort of government policy, or racism after COVID hit. I\u2019m also curious about the reason for the repeating yearly patterns, if people get hired and fired more often during some seasons in each year. The peaks seem to be around summer or fall, with the lowest rates in the winter and spring. I also wonder how different the graph would look if it were by population rather than difference. 30 million and 134 million are two very different starting points. Is this graph intentionally misleading, or is it just hard to understand?

I wonder how the foreign-born workers rate quickly recovered from the sharp decline, surpassing native-born workers in 2022.  I also wonder how the difference in percentages of native-born and foreign-born workers is so large, and why native-born workers did not return to work at a similar rate after 2020.

Before February 2020, the number of Native-born workers ranged from 96% to 101%, slightly increasing throughout the years. On the other hand, the number of foreign-born workers rose from 92% to a high of 100%, a major increase. After February 2020, both groups dropped drastically in percentage, with foreign workers having a more significant decline. However, by 2022, native-born workers returned to about their previous rate. In the years following 2020, foreign workers greatly exceeded native-born workers, reaching 110% in 2023.\n2. What change in businesses and corporations caused the shift in this graph? Why did the foreign workers increasing not cause native-born workers to decrease? What policies affect this data? Is this the result of more jobs being created?\n3. This relates to me because my family members and I are in the workforce.

This sharp rise in foreign-born workers suggests a resurgence as restrictions eased, and I wonder what specific factors contributed to this increase\u2014whether it was a loosening of immigration restrictions or an increase in job opportunities. For my community, this shift could mean more diversity in the workforce, especially in industries like healthcare, technology, and agriculture, which rely heavily on foreign-born workers. It could also lead to changes in hiring practices and greater integration of immigrant communities.

Firstly, I noticed how at the starting year of the graph, 2015, native-born workers were at a higher percentage than foreign-born workers, but their percentage quickly rose. I also saw how native-born workers had a continuous percentage that did not plummet or skyrocket, unlike the foreign-born workers. In 2020, right after the beginning of the pandemic recession, the foreign-born workers\u2019 percentages quickly plummeted. I wonder if this is because they could not travel at the height of the pandemic. I also noticed that foreign-born workers quickly skyrocketed again and if this can be related to President Biden opening up the border to people from other countries. I also wonder if future foreign policy will change these percentages by closing the border or deporting those from other countries. This relates to myself and the community because it shows that my community has workers from all over the world and how they work to afford the basic necessities of everyday life.

Foreign-born workers increased so much that there are more of them than native-born workers. But, as soon as the start of the pandemic recession, there was about the same amounts of workers from both sides, but foreign-born workers had dropped a lot more than the native-workers for a bit.\n2. I wonder why the foreign-born workers had dropped so much more compared to the native-born workers. Why did they have such a dramatic drop, but now are suddenly so much higher in the graph than the native-born workers? Why is the amount of native born workers mostly constant?\n3. My community is full of foreign-born workers, as most are from Hispanic countries and are immigrants, coming to start new lives in the US. I do remember almost no one working or having a job in my town once the pandemic began, which is reflective on both the foreign-born workers and also the native-born workers. Now my town is full of hard workers again, with both immigrant workers, and the children of these immigrants born here. \nHEADLINE: Foreign or Not, We're All Hard Workers: Comparing the Volume of Foreign-Born Workers to Native-Born Workers",

However, foreign-born employment rebounded quickly and has now surpassed pre-pandemic levels, reaching 109% by 2024, while native-born employment has remained around 100%. Before the pandemic, native-born employment was relatively stable, whereas foreign-born employment was gradually increasing. Since 2021, the gap between the two groups has widened, with foreign-born workers experiencing much stronger job growth.\n2)I wonder what factors contributed to the faster recovery of foreign-born workers compared to native-born workers. Were they more likely to take jobs in high-demand industries, or did labor shortages create more opportunities for them?\n3)New Jersey has a large immigrant population, so the strong job recovery among foreign-born workers may reflect local labor market trends, especially in industries like healthcare, transportation, and hospitality. \n4)Employment Rebound: How Foreign-Born Workers Took the Lead",

Why did native born workers not suffer as much of a decline as foreign-born, and how did they recover so fast? What industries were affected by these workforce changes and how does this impact the economy? \n\nRelation to Community - NJ has a diverse population and is home to many foreign-born residents.

Actually it just \"erased\" the covid decrease, as the level is now in the continuity of the trend of the pre-pandemic period.\n\nHowever, the level has not completely recovered among natives. This might be explained by the structure of the economy by sectors, but I don't know enough about the US labour market to tell. It's also rather curious that bumps in on curve often correspond to the opposite bump in the other.\n\nPut together, it might suggest a competition between natives and foreign workers, and foreign workers do better, likely because they are much cheaper.\n\nWhich, incidentally, tends to justify an anti-immigration policy. But such a policy would likely drive prices up, because of lower unemployment and better wages. I'm not an experth though...",
