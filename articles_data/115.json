However, there is a difference in the rates between some states like Michigan; who have a 9x rate, and Maine; who only has a difference of 3 people per 100. \nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why it differs from each state and what are the factors that make it such a different rate. Why are some states healthcare and prevention so useless that the infection rate was so high during the Covid pandemic. \nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nIt relates to the community because the covid pandemic was deadly and affected millions of people, therefore, by having a high rate of infection in prison, put the inmates and workers at risk. \nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea.\nDrastic different rates of Covid infection between all US states",

There are very small areas when they go out in the garden so they are all close. Also, they use the same equipment when exercising. this happens in many prisons in the same areas.

Michigan has the highest case rate in state prisons at 76 in 100. On the other hand, Maine has the lowest prison case rate at 7 in 100. I wonder if this has to do with the density of the state's population. Hawaii has the highest ratio of prison case rate to state population case rate; the number of prison cases to state cases is 15.8. I wonder what affec the case rate ratio and how the factors differ from the case rates themselves. I also wonder what factors cause the high infection rates in prisons. Is it that workers and visitors infect prisoners? Could it be more lenient health protocols? Since prisoners are confined to the facility, are they still given masks and vaccines? \n\nThis impacts me and my community because I have noticed that the state case rate has fluctuated throughout the pandemic. In Massachusetts, the prison case rate is 36 in 100, whereas the case rate in the entire state is 10 in 100. I would say compared to other states, we are in the middle range. \n\nA headline could be, \"Catching COVID Behind Bars\".",

I wonder why the prison cases are so high in Michigan than any other big state like California which probably has big prisons. Another thing I wonder about is why prison is more affect d than people outside in the world doing more than staying inside with the same people every day.

This impacts my community through state funding. In order to reduce the COVID contraction rates in prisons, there will most likely need to be an increase in spending to afford the required measures. Thus, in order to attempt to keep the state budget balanced, other funding will have to be cut, which could further impact education funding cuts (such as the 2020 temporary Oklahoma State Department of Education reduction of 2.5% or about $78.2 million). This will have a profound secondary impact on children's educational attainment levels and prospective future income attainment levels and the potential for long-run economic growth (as education level is a shifter of the Long-run aggregate supply curve which measures long-run economic growth).
