In 2019 there seems to be a faster decline in both immigration and natural increase and I wonder if that was caused by the pandemic and if those numbers will pick up in future years as covid has become less concerning.",

Another factor is that people may be immigrating because of raises in taxes and supplies. I wonder if the population in 2017 and 2019 was decreasing of less immigration and a decline in fertility rates. Environmental factors can also be the leading cause since natural disasters are becoming stronger. \n\nPopulation decrease may have negative impacts on our community by declining innovations since immigrants make up most of the U.S and benefit other counties. Immigration  increases the economic output by increasing the size of the labor force.\u00a0There is diversity with immigrants bringing their culture and ideas without them the world be dull.

Before then, the population change had been relatively steady. This makes me wonder what happened around 2016 that caused the overall decrease in population change. The population has also naturally decreased at an extreme amount in the past few years, with it reaching an extreme low in 2021. Immigration has decreased in a similar pattern to the natural population shifts, also reaching a low last year. Covid-19 could've had an effect on the population change in the past 2 years, however it does not explain the decrease in the years prior to 2020.

I also noticed that the natural increase rate dropped at an extremely fast rate in 2020 which I can guess is due to the deaths from COVID-19. Finally, both groups dropped drastically and consistently starting in 2016. I wonder why the drop was so large in 2016 and the causes for it. I know that the Trump administration started the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act in August 2017 which reduced levels of legal immigration in the United States by 50% by halving the number of green cards issued.

This can be contributed to the rising costs of raising a child. Healthcare in the United States is very expensive. Generations now are having trouble financially supporting themselves let alone a child. People are much more likely to be in debt nowadays. People are also getting married much later in life compared to past generations. Immigration has also been steadily decreasing over the past ten years, with the exception of a bump of immigration in 2015-2016. This can be contributed to immigration. This is probably because it has become much harder to obtain a green card in the United States. Policies and processes to get one are becoming much more difficult to get through. Both of these statistics are probably majorly affected by Covid-19. Traveling became much more difficult as many were told to stay in place and some were prohibited from entering the country.

I wonder if the population of immigrants switched over from increasing to decreasing due to the beginning of the Trump Administration, which is notorious for having strict immigration laws, in comparison to its previous administration. On the other hand, I wonder if the new trend in Americans waiting to have children is due to the decrease in the population. This affects me and my community because as the population decreases, many social welfare programs, like social security, medicare, etc. will be affected. A title for this graph could be \"America's Decreasing Population\"",

    "comment info": "Both of these graphs seemed to have dramatic decreases  after 2019. However, there is a steady decrease in the change in population by immigration and natural increase since 2016. This is probably due in part to several reasons. Immigration policies became very strict with Former President Trump, which limited the amount of immigrants coming into the US. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic shut down US borders indefinitely, leaving no one to come in or out. Regarding natural increase, I believe that many young people are not interested in having kids due to financial stability and other things.\n\nI wonder how this change will impact the economy and entities such as social security and retirement in the future. I also wonder how it will impact older generations, who rely on the workforce for their pensions. \n\nThis impacts me and my community because I will be going into the workforce in a few years.\n\nHeadline: The population isn't growing, here's why:",

I wonder why less people migrated to the US, and how it affected the country. I wonder if the line decreasing is related to stricter immigration laws and increased border patrol.

    "comment info": "It is evident both the rate of Immigration and the Natural Increase has been decreasing fast in the last decade, but there is an interesting detail! In the last year, the Natural Increase decreased more than the Immigration. Even though the rate of immigration is the lowest in a decade, It means the US is still the best place for immigrants' lives? \nEven though the population of the US is a large one in the world, I wonder this composition of the US population could be a sign that governmental politics have to be re-thinking. \nIt means that is necessary the government to think about this process because it could make a huge impact on many aspects of the US in the next decade or the next century like the economy, culture, workforce, etc. \nIt does not impact directly me or my community. I\u2019m from Brazil, however, this aggressive decrease in the US population could take a great impact on world business. \nCatchy Headline: THE POPULATION DECREASED - HOW DO THE USA DEAL WITH?",

After 2017, there was not a single increase since then.  \nI wonder how does the government ( or the people that calculate the information for the graph ) who exactly how many people start the immigration if they come to the US in secret? How do they count how many people have actually come into the USA in a year?\nThis has an impact on your community by letting us know that the rate of immigration has decreased meaning that there won't be people to do the jobs that everyone else doesn't want to do. All I am saying that usually people ( immigrants ) get the dirty jobs because they don't have the papers to be able to get a easier jobs. \nDid the immigrants find another place to migrate to?",

Overall, population growth over the years since 2011, when considering both lines, has ultimately decreased. Natural increase has went its highest in 2014 and Immigration in 2015.\nIs the decrease of one change in population a result of a change in the other? As immigrants assimilate into the United States population, there are then more people to provide generations for Natural Increase. The most this would be backed up however, would be 2013 through 2014, when both  increase in-tandem with each other. If possible, how would one later lead to the other decreasing?\nThis concerns my community depending on whether they have emigrated to live in the United States, ethnicity, and how concerned they are with the overall immigration and natural population changes in The United States. This information brings awareness to both aspects in population change decreasing, either due to a higher number of deaths and a lower number of births or a higher number of out-migration and a lower number of in-migration.\nHeadline: \"Population or Immigration?

I also noticed that they took a sample over the past 10 years, they could take a sample over 20 years to give more data to see if it follows a pattern.\n2. I wonder why the Immigration rates are rapidly decreasing and the natural increase is on the decrease as well. I also wonder what would happen to the economy if the population of Immigration and natural increase fell even more.\n3. This has an impact on the community because with less people being born and more dying over time will lead to a lesser population. This would most likely lead to a upward economy because less people will have to be payed in the future.\n4. Decrease in population has worries on the economy.",
