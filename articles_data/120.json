Indeed, Akita Prefecture, Japan, which is the region where I live, is a coastal area, suffered  damage by flooding two years ago. Also, the equatorial regions are at high risk of heat stress and wildfires. \n2. I wonder why the risk of wildfires is higher in the parts of Africa, North America and South America, even  though they are coastal areas in a tropical climate. In most cases, the air in tropical  coastal areas  doesn\u2019t really become dry, so the risk of  wildfires is low. \n3. According to the map, Japan, where I live,  is in danger of hurricanes and typhoons. Therefore, in my community, some buildings may fall down. In addition, there may be a power outage. \n4.

The main thing that Europe will deal with is flooding. \n        Then Asia, and Australia deals with flooding, and water stress. These are some huge problems that we are facing today, and it is only going to get worse overtime.

How they can grow to incorporate more environmentally friendly materials into their production processes?

Specifically, I wonder how human activity is impacting risks of a certain location. \u2028\n* \t\tWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\n    * Where I live, the biggest risk for me and my community is hurricanes and typhoons. Hurricanes are especially dangerous, considering their long-lasting effects. \u2028\n* \t\tWhat\u2019s going on in this map? Write a catchy headline that captures the map\u2019s main idea.\n    * This map highlights the leading climate risks across the globe that could be faced by 2040.

Never eat soggy waffles- no, it's east. But west works too) coast or all the way in inland Russia, disasters are out to get you. It's not paranoia if it's real, right? Something I'd rather look at though is a comparison between the rate and severity of disasters now and disasters in the future, like a scatterplot with two populations. From the graph, we can't really tell what is increasing in severity and by how much. I mean, typhoons already happen on a regular basis near Japan. It's right up there with tsunamis and Godzilla attacks, and how much worse can it get? Besides, Kind Kong's gonna back us up.\nBack on topic, however.

However,  it also made me wonder how the graph has this relatability to certain continents like since Australia had a forest fire before, it\u2019s almost no surprise that it would expect more wildfires by 2040.\n\nThis impacts not only our country, but the whole world that needs to be prepared for any upcoming climate risks.

It would be good to see what areas are in the most need that way it is easier to prioritize what areas may need help. I also wonder how many areas are in danger of more than one climate risk.

I also notice that most of Europe and Asia will be effected by water stress and sea levels rising. I wonder why the Southern and Northern poles will not be effected really at all. This might be because of the fact there is little human life located in these areas which result in less greenhouse-gas emissions being released. This impacts my community because by the time of 2040, I will still be alive. If the world endures what this graph is showing, there will be serious damage to my country and world. I live in the Northeast of America which would be effected by hurricanes and typhoons. Hurricane Sandy and Irene destroyed New Jersey and caused us to go without power for weeks. If by 2040, we are hit with more hurricanes, who knows what the extensive damage will be. \nNew Headline: \"Climate Change is Real, Take a Look\"",

I'm sure this is because of the amount of ice that is rapidly melting in these regions. In most parts of South America, wildfires and heat stress appear to be the top climate risks. The primary risk in midwestern America is water stress, while the primary risk on the east coast of America \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder if these top climate risks are already affecting lives in 2021. I wonder whether these top climate risks will start to increase before the year 2040. Is there any way we can delay the fruition of these natural disasters before they start to impact us more significantly? \n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nI live in an area where the top climate risk will be hurricanes and typhoons.

This is just a major concern because heat stress causes fires, and fires can cause habitat loss, life loss, just simply too much concern for fires all around the world. I also notice a lot of water stress. I assume this is concerning a lack of water, which is also a major concern, since it\u2019s the most vital resource to any animal ever, including humans. I notice little to no sea level rises and hurricanes/typhoons. This is good and also bad. Hurricanes are one of the most devastating natural disasters ever, so this is just absolutely horrible for those affected, including myself.\n\nI wonder what other disasters are in store for each region. This map shows the top climate risks, but that doesn\u2019t mean some other risk is 0.01% less likely to happen there, which we need to keep in mind. I wonder if this will change in the future. It\u2019s nearly impossible for us to cut down on greenhouse gases since we use these 24/7. Cars need them. Factories need them.

It appears as though the most area is covered by either heat stress or water stress. It makes sense that most of the flooding is happening in the northern hemisphere because the ice and glaciers located there now will melt and cause flooding on the borders of Canada, Iceland, Greenland, Alaska, and Russia.  \nOne of the things I\u2019m curious about is what's happening specifically on the coasts and the large bodies of water. Because we don\u2019t see how the water is being impacted on this graph we also fail to notice the major changes happening in the habitats of aquatic animals, especially those in the northern and southern hemispheres. In my region specifically, we will suffer from heat stress and flooding which makes sense because it\u2019s already starting to get warmer earlier in the spring and the temperature high\u2019s in the summer also are getting warmer every year. Because of our  few moving bodies of water to remove excess water from our state, flooding is something that seems likely and happens pretty frequently in neighboring states in the summers. Both of these things combined makes me nervous for our economic health which is dependent on agriculture. When we suffer from high temperatures and flooding, it is going to be very difficult to continue to grow corn & soybeans at the same volume we are now. Where will you live in 2040? Choose Wisely!",

I wonder if this is due to the map and the regions closest to the north pole.  The impact that this image has on me is that I live in Massachusetts and judging by what I am observing the eastern coast is more likely to be hit by hurricanes and typhoons in the year 2040.

Water stress is particularly concentrated in the centers of land where they are not exposed to giant bodies of water, but instead there might be streams, rivers, lakes, etc. around those areas. Flooding is found largely at the borders of the land masses where they are exposed to large bodies of water. I also notice that heat stress is concentrated more around the equator. \n\nWhat do you wonder? \nI wonder that if there is supposed to be a lot of flooding, why are the sea levels not rising in the areas were there is supposed to be a lot of flooding? Will the flooding be caused by something other than rising sea levels? \n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community? \nIt seems that around Iowa, we\u2019re most at risk for heat stress and flooding. I find this interesting, because most of the heat stress is around the equator, and in Iowa, we're not very close the equator. This will definitely have an effect on farming since Iowa is a very agriculturally centered state. \n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this map?

Another thing I noticed was that floods mostly occurred on land close to the ocean with a few exceptions in Europe and Africa. Water stress for the most part also happens mostly in the Northern Hemisphere and on the bottom of South America, Africa, and Australia. \nWhat do I wonder?\nOne thing I wonder is what other effects would happen that aren\u2019t shown on the map. There is nothing on Antarctica, but with greenhouse gas emissions it causes more and more of the ice to thaw. I wonder if this would be the cause for the sea levels to rise? I wonder how much the ice covered land will change in the next 20 years with the amount of thawing that would happen?\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nI live in Iowa and looking at this map the biggest problem we would face is water stress. This is very bad considering that Iowa is an agriculture state. With a shortage of water our crops would not do as well and in turn it would cause us to have a shortage of food. We also have more farm animals than people and it could become a situation where we do not have enough water to give to the farm animals. \nCatchy Headline\n\u201cWhat the World Will Look Like in 2040 if WE DO NOTHING to Stop it\u201d",

There has been a lot of studies about the effect increased greenhouse gases have had on insects and the diseases they cause, both to people and plants.  Yes, mosquitos for people.  In Tennessee, how have climate changes affected Tennessee\u2019s tree pests:  Asian long-horned beetle, emerald ash borer, hemlock woolly adelgid, and gypsy moth?",
