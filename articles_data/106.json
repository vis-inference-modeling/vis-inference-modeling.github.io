I wonder when the last time the number of house members per state was updated. This will effect the balance of power in the house as well as the electoral collage. Another thing I noticed was that a majority of the states that gained seats are republican controlled states, and the states that lost seats were controlled by democrats. So I wonder if the republicans are in anyway gerrymandering the house seats to be fit them, as they have been prone to gerrymandering elections in the past.",

Something that I noticed is that there is an equivalent balance between the number of members lost and then gained. This is because there should be 435 members divided among 50 states so there should never be more states gaining members without states also losing members. Something I also noticed is that the states that were affected by this change were decently sized states. Also, most of the more populated states like California and New York lost seats. Compared to less populated states like Montana and Oregon gaining seats. I wonder how much this affects the House. I also am curious as to how a state gets to gain members or how they lose members.

About the pandemic, note that the 2020 census data was valid as of the beginning of April 2020, so the pandemic effect would be pretty limited in its impact on this. \nHere's a little calculation you might use to help answer your wondering about why Texas might gain seats while California, also growing in population, might lose a seat. Look up the populations of the US on the 2010 census and the populations of TX and CA in 2010. Compute what percent of Americans were from each of those states in 2010. Then, do the same thing for the 2020 census data.

If every state increases by the same number, there would be no change in seats.  But, for example, if some large states increased by a large percentage and other smaller states increased by a smaller percentage, there would be a reallocation of seats.\n\nHow does this relate to your community?  The Census count allocates billions of dollars in federal, state and local funding for everything from schools and housing to hospitals and highways. Governments, businesses and nonprofit organizations use the census to make decisions for their operations.  Your state was recognized for pumping up its efforts to count everyone since so much was at stake.  Read about what was done.",

One thing I noticed is that the number of seats gained and the number of seats lost is equivalent in order to keep the same number of seats overall for the House. It surprised me that New York and California both lost one seat because they are highly populated states. One reason for this could be because of the amount of people that left cities such as Los Angeles and New York City due to fear of the pandemic. I wonder why the population in Texas has increased so much that it receives two extra seats now. I also notice how all of the states that lost seats (except CA) are all in close proximity to each other, meaning the population decrease was widespread over that area.

This could be because the population in California has dropped since the last national census in 2010. The same goes for Michigan, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. This is a contrast of states like Texas Colorado, Oregon, Montana, North Carolina, and Florida, whereas these states have increased in population and therefrore have gained more house seats.

However, if we look deeper into the cause of population decrease in different states, we can see a pattern of how most developed states have a decreasing population and the ones that are developing has an increasing population.

For states with historically higher populations, their population is decreasing. The population in this graph is measured, not by how many people are now living in the states, but by how many seats the state gained/lost in the House of Representatives. Even though the graph does not say exactly how many people now live in the state as compared to previous times, a change in the states' seats in the House is an indicator in a change in the population. \nI wonder if the pandemic has had any role in this shift. In the graph, the population of Texas and Florida increased. Since these two states have had notably lenient COVID-19 protocols in the pandemic, I wonder if people are relocating to these states where there is less regulation for COVID-19. \nThis relates to me and my community because the town that I live in is discussing rearranging the public school system arrangement so they can better fit the children in our town. \nA Change in Congressional Seats",

SD probably wouldn't lose any seats no matter what because I think we only have 1 house of representatives. \n\nI think what's going on in this graph represents changes in populations that are large enough to affect the number of representatives. Maybe a good title for this would be A Representation of Change?",

In California, the amount of seats is much greater than any other state. From this we can see that California has the highest population, and therefore has the most say in political voting. Texas also has a large amount of representatives, but instead of losing seats they are gaining them. After the 2020 census, it was apparently concluded that Texas has gained a much bigger population, and California's population has went down. I find this very interesting. I also see that the population of New York has went down, which may be an effect of Covid-19. My guess is that people are leaving the big cities to escape the threat of the virus.\n\nI wonder why some of the states have not changed in the amount of seats, but others have gained some or lost some. I wonder what is attracting people to these different states, and how much the population has to go up for that state to get another seat. I also wonder why California has lost seats. My guess is that with the coronavirus, people are leaving the higher populated areas, and going to the rural areas. \n\n\nThis relates to me and my community because it tells us that the population of New Hampshire has stayed relatively the same.

The larger states with a greater population (such as California with cities such as San Francisco and New York with NYC) are beginning to lose seats while others that are still populated but do not have as large of cities such as Texas and Florida are gaining them. Another thing I noticed is that the same number of seats were awarded and lost. In the states that were taken seats away from it came out to a total of -7 and the number of seats that were awarded came out to +7. This makes me wonder if there is a specific amount of seats in congress that can be filled at one time or if it was wanted there could be more added if it was found that a state should have more representation. The last thing that I noticed was that three of the original 13 colonies lost a chair in congress, while one (being North Carolina) gained one chair. Could that have been related to the fact that they were part of the 13 colonies? Does that change the number of seats they should have in the first place? The main thing that I wonder is how much of a population change a state must have to gain or lose a representative seat.

Similarly, states gaining seats are mostly republican, or red. This could show that the Republicans seem to be more liked, and are therefore receiving more seats, opposite the democrats.\nI'm wondering how a state such as California, with a population of almost 40 million people, could be losing a seat to, say, Montana, whose population is only about 2 million.\nI doesn't seem to be affecting my community much, as I live in NH. I am also under the age of 18, so it affects me personally even less.\nA title I would create would be: Why are Democratic States losing seats to Republican States?",

Try googling TX population and find out what might be causing that state to grow so much over that decade. And while CA continues to grow, what happened to the proportion of Americans that are from TX over that decade, vs what happened to that of CA?\nAnd what difference might it make to you in NH, a state that didn't gain or lose a seat, that TX gains two seats while CA loses one?",

One of the most obvious details is that more states are losing seats than gaining them, but there are several more details that are less noticeable. For one, the majority of the green (or gaining) seats are red states, that meaning that they are primarily considered to be republican (excluding Oregon and Colorado) On the flip side, the majority of the yellow (or losing) seats are democratic states. This graph shows that people may be starting to move towards more republican based communities. It is possible that the Republican party will gain more hold in the government with the support of more people, and more votes.\nI wonder what will happen at the next election, currently the democratic party has more power in the government because our president is a democrat, but the republicans are gaining more support, so there will likely be unrest between the parties at the next place where the population will have to take sides. \nThis will cause a rift between the people in our community, since people will be forced between the Republicans rising power, or to defend the Democrats current hold.",

States like Texas and Florida have a bigger population, which led to gaining seats. Then there are states like West Virginia that are not as much populated that are losing seats. What does not make sense is that California is losing seats, and it is just as big as Texas and Florida. Another thing that I just realized is that Florida and Texas are Republican states, while states like California and  West Virginia who are Democratic and losing states, maybe that has something to do with it? Could Republicans be more popular and that leads to states with republicans to get a seat. Then there are states in the middle like Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama who are very well known to picking republicans for president, or any other position, who are listed as no change? I live here in Tennessee and I know all my life, every single year we always pick the republican. Donald Trump blew out Hillary Clinton here in Tennessee, Donald Trump also beat out Joe Biden here in Tennessee, so I would not see why we are unlisted. I goes back to my reason about the population, I know that Texas, Florida, and Colorado are big states. Then why is California losing a seat and like Montana gaining a seat. I can actually see both reasons playing a key factor in which states should lose or gain a seat. One more thing, I wonder if those squares represent the amount of representatives in the state?",

How about populous California \u2013 it is losing a seat.  And, how about Montana, a small state that gained a seat.  Something else must be going on here.\n\nThe predominant party of a state plus many other factors affect the gain or loss of population.  The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives is determined by Article I, Section II of the Constitution and Reapportionment Act of 1929.

In California, taxes are relatively high and due to the pandemic some people may not have been able to sustain themselves in such a demanding state. Texas on the other hand is still a state under development with so much land and things are much cheaper than compared to california. due to the pandemic, some people may have moved out of cali and more people stayed in Texas/went to Texas. which makes me wonder if the population of each state directly corresponds to the number of seats. \n\nIn hawaii, the number of seats stayed the same which may be because hawaii\u2019s population stayed the same.",

What I noticed was that  democratic/blue states and are more populated, such as California and New York, are losing seats whereas republican/red states, such as Texas and Florida,  are gaining more seats. Additionally, there is a certain amount of seats there are in a state. For example, California has a total of 53 seats but with the subtraction of one seat it is now a total of 52 seats. Furthermore, smaller states have no impact whatsoever. \n2. I wonder why many states have no impact at all. Could it be that they don't have sufficient funding as a result of the pandemic? Or that the population just isn't large enough to contribute to a change?\n3. This relates to my community because our state is losing seats which could decrease our impact on the census, especially since many people are leaving the state due to high costs of living. \n4. What is happening in this graph is that blue states are losing seats in congress as opposed to red states which are gaining more seats. Headline: \"The loss and gain of seats\"",

The population of each state correlates to the number of representatives.  We also noticed that the amount of squares in each state represented the number of representatives in that state. One thing we wonder redlining and gerrymandering has to do with these demographic shifts. We also wonder if the increase in taxes have to do with the population shifts. We also wonder what the population is per representative, and what the requirements are for that. This relates to us because we just lost one representative which affects our say in legislature.
