The graph supports this because it shows that if there is more force, players have gotten stage 4 C.T.E. Also, most of the players who have been hit with less force, are at lower stages and even no C.T.E.\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder if the players who were studded had different helmets, with different levels of protection. If someone was to be hit while wearing a helmet with less padding, then someone with a more padded helmet, they would probably be more at risk to get C.T.E. \nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis is useful in my community because it is such a football focused area.

With only 1696 football players in the NFL and this study utilizing 631 players, we know there is no sample size or speculation issue. \n\tI wonder why the graph showcases around 35% of players with no chronic traumatic encephalopathy near the right end of the chart. It is an exact outlier compared to the rest of the data and completely ignores the established increasing trend. \n\tConsidering that my neighborhood is extremely close-knit and full of children who play basketball professionally, looking into the long-term effects of drastic injuries during the sport should be considered.",

Many athletes with less severe hits to the head, or not likely to have CTE. I wonder what metric they use to decide the amount of cumulative force used to cause that injury. I also wonder if hits to different parts of the head affect the severity of CTE. I wondered this because the graphs are not necessarily regular and rise and dip in numbers throughout the entirety of them. The graph is tracking the stages of CTE in football players with heads to the head ranging from less cumulative force to more cumulative force. though the graphs are not necessarily consistent in rising. They show a general trend towards hits to the head, using more cumulative force, causing a higher stage of CTE. This can relate to me and my community because head injuries can be very serious and very dangerous, and in America football is a very popular sport that can cause people severe concussions. Head injuries to athletes, especially in American football are very serious but common, and that\u2019s why athletes need to take the necessary precautions to protect them and the well-being of their brain.

    "comment info": "This graph shows the cumulative force of head hits for 631 former football players and how that affected their  CTE. From this graph, I observe that more cumulative force usually creates greater head trauma, and less curative force results in less head trauma. CTE or chronic traumatic encephalopathy is associated with repeated blows to the head. Therefore it can be assumed that the more traumatic these hits are the more damage they will cause. I wonder if there is a direct correlation between the severity of the disease in the symptoms of memory loss, depression, aggressive behavior, and, sometimes, suicidal thoughts. This graph further demonstrates how unpredictable CTE can be at times. For example, if someone is hit with middle-level cumulative force they could have anywhere from no CTE at all to extremely severe stage 4 CTE. This could be a seriously life-changing difference for someone. However, there is a clear trend within the graph that directly relates more force with a greater CTE and less force with minor or no CTE. I really hope that this graph reaches the right audience and spreads awareness of contact sports such as football and boxing where head injuries are common. I also hope that this leaves an impact on people so much so that there become more regulations and/or head protective gear in these sports to try and prevent severe CTE for players, especially teens who will suffer the long-term effects.\n\u201cWatch Out Head Trauma Coming Your Way!\u201d",

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, C.T.E. for short, a brain disease that can result from repeated trauma to the head, is currently both incurable and fatal. According to this graph, the more head trauma a football player experiences, the more likely they are to suffer from C.T.E. While C.T.E. can cause illnesses such as dementia, it has also been deteriorating mental health. Former players, Junior Seau, Philip Adams, and Dave Duerson, all diagnosed with severe depression from C.T.E., took their own lives. Aaron Hernandez and Jovan Belcher, both players suffering from C.T.E., were described as growing violent before commiting murder. I wonder why C.T.E., being such a pressing issue, is it not being discussed and researched more.

I find this anomaly extremely confusing and conclude it to be basic luck by the players that have suffered many head injuries, yet not end up with CTE. It does show that the people who have hit their head with the most cumulative force are always getting the worst cases of CTE and the people who get hit with the least cumulative force don\u2019t get the worst type of CTE and over 50% don\u2019t even get CTE at all.\n2. The anomaly part of the graph where there is a section of people getting hit with more cumulative force, yet don\u2019t get CTE is the part that interests me the most. This seems to be one of those weird things that happens where someone smokes and drinks their entire life and ends up living till their 90\u2019s, something that just can happen by some sort of miracle. I think that this part of the graph just goes to show the weird possibilities human bodies can accomplish. \n3. This affects my community because football is played by people our age, meaning that people that haven\u2019t even gotten to college could be getting CTE. I find that this is very dangerous and I feel that we should be finding a way to minimize injury in this sport until it dwindles down once people realize how weird it is to watch people just hit each other for a job. \n4.

Athletes ache to get back in the game and coaches push them to heal faster. So, football players might not even think about C.T.E. when entering their profession.

There is one oddity towards the end of the more cumulative force side of the sample where only 70% of those surveyed suffered from C.T.E, while 100% of those surveyed with slightly more or less force suffered. I wonder when this data was collected. And, if football players can see this information, why do they keep playing? Does the NFL lie to them and underplay the risks to get them to continue performing? I also wonder if the NFL provides professional support to its former players who now have C.T.E. because of their time playing football. I personally know a lot of people who play sports where their heads are often subjected to injury. For example, my little sister plays soccer and often uses her head to hit the ball. This makes me worry that she may someday also suffer from C.T.E. if she continues to play soccer intensely.

As the cumulative force is exerted on a player the number of players with no CTE decreases to 0 and with an overall higher CTE levels. At the highest intensity all players in the study had stage 4 CTE.\n\nOne thing I wondered is how to protect football players from CTE. There have been some improvements in safety with specialists on the sideline, tougher regulation, and new helmet technologies, however CTE is still a problem in football. I want football to be an engaging game that makes the viewer invested, but I also want to ensure the safety of all players. I want to create a balance between entertainment and safety. \n\nIn my community health and safety is very important, but so is having fun. I have seen many people get injured playing sports. I often see myself facing a moral dilemma on safety and fun. I want to put my full strength into playing a sport, but I do not want to hurt anyone. I have sacrificed \u2018winning\u2019 to prevent injury, but I have also sacrificed health to \u2018win\u2019. With these scenarios I always question what is worth more in the short term and long term? \n\nI would use the headline \u201cIs Fun Worth One\u2019s Health\u201d.

Over 1/3 of the players with the less forceful head hits still developed C.T.E. As I look toward the middle of the x-axis, the numbers of players with C.T.E. nearly triple. As cumulative force of head hits increases, the numbers of C.T.E. skyrocket. This disease seems almost inevitable for football players experiencing repetitive head trauma (which occurs often in the sport). I wonder what percentage of former NFL players have C.T.E., I think it is worthwhile to do a similar study with a much larger population in order to better grasp the amount of players C.T.E. affects/affected. If the number is concerning, more awareness could be brought to this disease and preventative measures could be taken. This relates to me and my community because I watch football very often in the fall and winter. I see players experience head hits that could possibly lead to C.T.E. later down the line. Knowing the true scale and implications of this disease makes me not want to watch football as it lends itself to traumatic head injuries and I do not want to support something that is causing so much widespread harm. I hope that others in my community would feel similarly if they knew more about C.T.E., and I am sure that many parents would discourage their children from participating in football. \n\nHeadline- Football: Putting Players' Health in the Red Zone",

A team sport that brings people together, football is a large part of modern american culture. The question I want you to ask yourselves today is do we blame the sport or do we blame the equipment. Kids should be able to play sports while being safe and competitive. I am not suggesting we wrap kids in bubble wrap and send them out onto the field but we need to take certain precautions to discontinue this particular issue.  It is blows my mind how many kids get hurt for playing this great game. It is a contact sport and big hits are destined to happen. Its part of the game. You cant expect zero injuries to occur but we can help prevent them while keeping the sport just as physical and fun. I think the solution is to improve equipment and access to good equipment. People in some high schools don't have updated equipment that will keep them safe. It is of the essence to improve equipment for kids and adults. This may upset some people because schools may have to spends more money on football than they already do but it is for the safety of your kids.

The x-axis of the graph depicts the extremity of the brain disease, C.T.E in correlation to the amount of force applied (stage 1 being of lesser extremity and stage 4 as a more extreme form of C.T.E). With this information, I noticed that the greater cumulative force applied to the head, the more likely the C.T.E was at stage 3 or 4, or very severe and had the possibility of deeper internal injury. This applies vice-versa, where the less cumulative force means a greater chance of a lower form of C.T.E (or none at all). I wonder if the people that conducted the research group to examine C.T.E now advise people against playing football (because of the risk of severe head injury). I also wonder how an area or region of the brain that was hit with force impacted the stage of C.T.E. This graph relates to my community because it serves as a warning to those that play football or other sports that may involve force to the head. This is because it can influence people to wear proper protective gear and know the risks of playing.

    "comment info": "Football is a relatively dangerous sport, given how many players suffer from head injuries on average. A C.T.E., or Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is a traumatic brain injury like a concussion. Football encourages players to tackle other players with extreme force to knock them down or remove obstacles. There is little control over how a person falls once they are hit, but how they are hit absolutely determines how badly they are injured. 100% of players who were hit with extreme force got a stage 4 C.T.E. upon impact on the ground. I notice how night numbers of players have received severe head trauma from the sport, but there is little education on how to prevent those injuries. Being hit with extreme force will lead to injury, but in the heat of the game, players are not actively thinking about injury prevention, only winning. I wonder why there is not more of an emphasis on safety in football. While players do wear padding, they are still praised for hard hits and tackles are a main part of the entertainment in TV coverage. It is upsetting to see how dangerous it is because of how popular the sport is for Americans both play and watch. With events like the Super Bowl, it is easy to forget how dangerous the game is for the players. We encourage good tackles and wild plays, but in reality, the safety of the players should be the most important part.

I wonder if the positions of the football players can affect this graph. If this graph's sample was mostly made of former quarter backs than former lineman would the percentage of C.T.E be lower. Many of my peers play football for their high school, and this statistics shows the correlation between cumulative force in football and C.T.E.  Your Gonna Feel That Later: Head Hits",

It seems as though the more people studied, the higher the amount of cases rise, so it makes me wonder how many people out there are walking around with CTE and no one would ever notice, not even the ones who actually have it.\n\n3)In my community, football is a very apparent sport. It takes up the bulk of the children growing up in a sports environment. This makes me worry about the future of our community and environment if the sport they are playing is probably the worst for their mental state.

Towards the beginning of the graph we see the group of football players who absorbed less cumulative force of head impacts and there is mostly no CTE with only a couple of Stage 1s and 2s. But as you go towards the right of the graph we start to see more Stage 3s and 4s as the cumulative force absorbed increases. This shows that over time as the force of the head impacts adds up, the stage level of CTE increases.\n\nI wonder why some of the cumulative force of head impacts doesn't affect others. Towards the very right of the graph, the gray is very distinctive. In a sea of red and orange, the gray sticks out as it shows a group of football players who experienced a good amount of head impacts had no CTE at all. This is interesting because why do they have no CTE even though they have enough cumulative force of head impacts to develop Stage 4 CTE?\n\nThis relates to me and my community as CTE is a very serious problem in schools. Parents are concerned about allowing their children to play football as it's a very physical sport and they don't want their children to get hurt. Learning about CTE and the amount of head impacts it takes to develop CTE can help us, as a community, to keep our football players safe on the field.\n\nCTE: When Is It One Too Many Hits?",

    "comment info": "The positive relationship between cumulative force and severity of injury could not be more obvious. Every graph moves up and to the right, with only minor deviations. This is a shocking and damaging reflection on head injuries in football. But I wonder how they estimate cumulative force over a career. Game reports? Videos? Does each hit get equal weight or can you somehow measure small hits and big ones? Also how do they categorize the four levels of brain damage, and is there a correlation between each level and the subjective impairment of the player going about their daily life? These details would be interesting.\nI am not directly involved in football in my community, but this must have a chilling effect on any family sending their kid to play the sport.\nHEAD Line: A Forceful Argument for protecting your head in Football.",

        "comment info": "Good morning, @Paul F --\n\nYou are so right that you should know about how this data was collected.  It\u2019s not a simple process since CTE cannot be detected until after death when brains are examined.  And, the number of hits and concussions including their force is not known for players.  \n\nYou can read in depth about data collection in the study \u201cLeveraging football accelerometer data to quantify associations between repetitive head impacts and chronic traumatic encephalopathy in males\u201d and read a summary in the article that includes this graph.  By Friday, we will reveal the article with a free link.  Then, you can find many answers to your questions.",

    "comment info": "Looking at this graph, the first thing that stood out to me was the variables. The way that the variables are stated, especially the percentage of players, stood out because as the percentage approaches 100%, the amount of C.T.E. damage dilutes. This makes sense because as you add more people to a study, it will become more diluted, but at first glance it looks like they amount of Stage 4 C.T.E. cases decreases. This makes me wonder if this graph was intentionally made to exaggerate the original data. I am able to relate this to my community as there are many football players within my school that have dealt with this exact situation, either causing them to take extended breaks or quit sports entirely. I think the perfect headline for this graph would be \u201cThe safety of playing football is much scarier than meets the eye.\u201d",

I\u2019m wondering where you see evidence that the \u201camount of Stage 4 C.T.E. cases decreases.\u201d  Also, this may help you understand if, in fact, the \u201cgraph was intentionally made to exaggerate the original data.\u201d  \n\nWith graphs, you just have to study in more depth the variables, axes and the graph to see what its story is.  You may want to discuss your noticings with a classmate and see if together you can find the story.",
