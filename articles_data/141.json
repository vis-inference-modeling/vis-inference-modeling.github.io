Everything from social workers to farmers women are everywhere. I wonder why there is such a high percentage of social and health care workers who are women? I think that is a wonderful thing but I genuinely wonder why is healthcare and social work now a female dominated field?",

    "comment info": "After analyzing the graph, I notice that the majority of essential workers are women, with a 52% share. Essential occupations such as resource extraction, farmers, and law enforcement have a majority of men, which may stem from previous social beliefs about occupations for women. One statistic that surprises me is the health care and social care share, which display a majority of women in that field. Even through acts of oppression throughout the 20th century, women are able to receive the majority of essential jobs in our nation, but this doesn\u2019t coordinate with another statistic. Although women take the majority of essential occupations, does their compensation coordinate with their importance in these occupations? Due to previous acts of oppression, it has been an ongoing issue that is still debated. Regardless of the reasoning, women have and will remain an important aspect of the American workforce.",

It makes sense that a little more than half of all essential workers are female because that is obviously how the world is made up. I was somewhat surprised to see how a majority of social workers and health care workers were female, however. I wonder why resource extraction has fewer female workers. Beyond that, it will be interesting to see if or how this demographic changes in the next few years. Overall, it is great to see how many women have essential jobs in the U.S. after overcoming oppression from the past and still to this day.",

I also notice that there are way more women in the social workers with 78% then the resource extraction with only 11%. The most equal split is in critical retail with 53% females. I also notice that the amount of females in social workers and health care with only a 1% difference even though the total number of workers in health care is way more then the social workers- almost a 17 million people difference! I wonder why there's such a big difference in the social workers and health care even though the percentage of women is almost the same. I also wonder why there are only 11% of women in resource extraction. This does not have much of an impact on me- at least not yet. This does have a pretty big impact on females that work, the ratio of males to females can affect how they work, how much they're paid, and how they're treated.

The gender stereotypes I have grown up with and been exposed to are apparent even in the occupational differences between women and men. The medical field and social sciences have always seemed more feminine to me, rather than law enforcement and defense, which appear more predominantly male. I believe a good question to ask ourselves, though, is if this separation of genders in the workplace is inherently bad. Personally, I would argue that no, these differences are not harmful to either gender. They can become detrimental, though, when certain stigmas or stereotypes are enforced because of mere statistics. For example, to say that women only belong in the health fields because they are not capable of anything else, is not only wrong, but also extremely limiting to young girls as they consider their futures. I think that each person should be challenging themselves to think outside of the societal norms that have been in place for decades, encouraging the breakdown of these barriers. No woman, or man, should feel inferior or superior to another simply because of their occupation. I believe it is time to begin challenging the status quo of women in the workforce, encouraging this nation\u2019s young girls to explore their true desires, not those that have been predetermined for them.",

The role of feminism and women power has really and continues to have women be more in the essential workforce. This can be seen in the graph. \n2.  What I wonder based on the graph is that social workers, health care and law enforcement are all similar to the realm of morality and ethic, however law enforcement is very low in the workforce of women when compared social workers and health care. One might suspect since all three are similar morality they would be the top 3 highest. I also wonder in the changes and the current workforce of women now.

I think these jobs are sparsely occupied by women because they are risks, decisions sometimes have to be made with no time to think things through, usually with serious consequences. Men usually have a better instinct to take a risk than women. That's not saying that women are worse at making stressful, quick decisions, its just that it is less instinctual for them.

Out of 48,710,000 workers more than 50 percent of women are essential workers, while the rest are men. Notice how health care workers almost build up half of the total for essential workers; this plays a big roll to why more women are essential workers. \nI wonder why more women lean towards the medical field and jobs that care for people. Could it be within a females nature to tend for others and could it be within a males nature to do more physical demanding jobs?\nIt is a proven fact that women are better at taking care of people than men and research shows that people have a better chance at surviving when under the care of a female doctor than a male, maybe its a motherly instinct. Imagine a world with no female doctors and only male doctors, do you think the human population would be greater or less than the population today?

The total amount of healthcare workers is much larger than any other essential career field currently, so it is important that women make up such a larger percentage of that group. However besides those two fields and also critical research, women are a minority in every other field of essential workers. I wonder what causes such a drastic difference in gender inequality within the different fields. How are women taking up such a large majority in certain fields, but hardly work in any other fields at all? This graph impacts me because as a woman, it concerns me that in the majority of these fields, women's presence is very limited and it is upsetting to see there is still such strong gender inequality and stigmas in society. Although on the other hand, it is inspiring to see women taking charge in a few of these career fields, because I feel as though a graph comparing these fields from 2000 or 2010 would likely show even lower percentages in women in any of these fields. \"Men and Women Taking Charge as Essential Workers in Different Fields.\"",

This isn't a surprise during a pandemic, however, it is surprising to see the number gap. Health care has 19,090,000, while the next biggest category, Transportation, has 6,140,000. This is over double the amount of workers. You can also see that health care is 77% women. It seems the typical \"feminine\" jobs, such as health care and social work are primarily female, and the typical \"masculine\" jobs, like law enforcement and IT, are primarily male. I wonder why there are a lot more women who work in health care and social work than men. What are the factors behind why women take up the majority of those type of career roles. I am also curious about the salaries of female essential workers compared to male essential workers when considering jobs that have a high percentage of females in that field, compared to a job that has a low percentage of females working in that field. The impact that this has on our community highlights the share of services that women are more likely to be represented in and we are going to see. It also can be extrapolated to show what careers women may be more likely to go into. Essential worker careers are pretty evenly shared between men and women, so who you are helped by is an even chance between men and women.

Social work and healthcare work does pay more than other jobs like transportation and resource extraction. The biggest motivation for working is pay.

As you follow the list of jobs down, the percentage of women in that job decreases. I noticed that this pattern follows a pattern of stereotypical jobs. Jobs such as law enforcement, transit/transportation, defense, can be considered as \"manly\" jobs.  The jobs that have the largest percentages of female workers cater towards health and social services. I feel that these fields are more associated towards the nurturing character of women. I wonder if less women are in law enforcement, defense, etc. because less women apply to such jobs or if more women are rejected from those jobs. In addition, I wonder why most women work as in health care, critical retail, and social work. I also wonder what this graph would like if these bars were then separated by ethnicity. It would also be interesting to tie this graph to the level of education that workers receive. Lastly, I wonder how accurate this graph is, seeing as it's taken from 2014-2018. This impacts my community because it shows how women are equally as essential to the workforce as men, and in some cases, dominate specific fields. You can also relate this to today and to the most common majors that students choose for their studies. It also shows all the different jobs that are considered essential to our community.

In total, there are 21,410,000 people who hold those jobs and only 16,508,900 are women. It also looks like the percentage of working women decreases from handling medical supplies to resource extraction. I wonder about which states or cities this data came from as well as the pay difference between the men and women who work these jobs. I wonder about how the percentages changed from before the pandemic and how it will be affected once it is over.  Lastly, it\u2019ll be intriguing to learn about the difference in pay for women who are social workers and those who do resource extraction. The impact this topic has on me is quite huge. I am a female, currently in my junior year of high school deciding what career I want to do in the future. This graph opened my eyes to the many essential jobs in the country and gives me an idea of the different careers I can put myself into. The impact this topic has on my community is that there are women within my community who are essential workers. There are also young female adults who are currently looking for jobs or are on their way to pursuing their careers having one of them categorized as essential work. If they choose essential work that is not usually picked up by women, it could change the outlook of jobs that are usually picked up by men.",

I notice that the graph starts with a general percentage of the total amount of female essential workers in the U.S. The bar chart lists the essential jobs with higher percentages of females towards the top, and the jobs with less females towards the bottom. I notice that essential social workers have the largest percentage while resource extraction is the smallest percentage. The health care bar is something else I notice because it has the second highest percentage of females in the study and it has the largest amount of total workers out of all the data. \n\n2. I wonder what makes a job more appealing to a female than a man? For professions such as social work or health care, there is an overwhelming amount of females than males. Why are those jobs more desirable to women? Why is Defense or Resource Extraction less popular to women? Is it a similar factor in each of these jobs that makes it more appealing to a women? \n\n3. The impact this has on my community and I is it could encourage the next generation to prove this data wrong. A young boy could become a social worker or a nurse and lower the percentage of females in the job after seeing how few men are involved. A little girl could be motivated to raise the percentage of females in jobs at the bottom of the graph. It pushes us to prove the stereotypes wrong, and promote the idea that gender does not qualify someone for a job. \n\n 4. A catchy headline could be, \"Essential Workers? How about Essential Females\"",

In fact, my headline I created was something similar. \n\n\"Essential Workers: Women Have Been The Glue Holding The World Together During The Coronavirus Pandemic!\"\n\nWe can clearly see that a large percentage of the women working the essential positions take on bigger roles in the healthcare and social services world. \n\nI feel as if this is due to the fact that women have more of an emotional connection to people. The whole purpose behind these two careers are to help people out in the world, whether it's in their social environment or their health. \n\nI feel as if men don't have this emotional connection to people and take on the grueling jobs our world has to offer. Law enforcement and dealing with crime, handling hazardous materials, and transit/transportation are seen as jobs men tend to handle.\n\nStereotypes play a huge role here, with many being around for years. \n\nWomen are being recognized for their hard work. I also feel as if they're finally getting the attention they deserve for their efforts over the decades. \n\nMany once said they would never be able to work, yet here they are, holding our country together!",

There's a possibility that it could be less due to women being rejected from the job for not having the same qualities as a man.

In the careers that tend to require less education, there seems to be fewer women, but this is not always the case.\nI wonder why women are attracted to jobs in social work in health care. Is it because women tend to prefer jobs where they are able to help or nurture others? I also wonder why fewer women take up jobs that require less education. Is it because in certain areas, women are not expected to have to work and they could simply stay at home should they not have received a higher education?\nThis has a large impact not only on my community, but also on my life as a girl. Although the only jobs represented are essential work, the gender gap is prevalent in many different job fields (and not only for women!). If I wanted to be a university professor at a top institution, I would likely be outnumbered by men. The percentage of female artists in the met modern art section is less than 20%. Fewer than 20% of engineers are female. But in my community, this shows the small number of people who had to work and put their health at risk.

Based off of the information provided by the graph, I noticed that the majority of female essential workers operate in the areas of healthcare and social services. Moreover, women clearly make up slightly over half of essential workers as a whole. I find it encouraging, as a girl, that men and women are both roughly equal in the present-day realm of the workforce. The actual number of total female essential workers is astounding because 52% of the total 48,710,000 workers is 25,329,200. Nevertheless, returning to the initial detail that I noticed about the more common areas that female essential workers operate in, I wonder what most of their positions are in that area. For instance, in healthcare, are there more female doctors, nurses, or receptionists, among the other available jobs in that area. I wonder the same in the area of female social workers as well. These queries are simply out of curiosity, because a person\u2019s role as an essential worker shouldn\u2019t be undermined by their position or particular job. When it comes to my community in New Jersey, my mom is a NICU nurse and many of my friends\u2019 and classmates\u2019 mom or parent is a nurse.

This arises a question, why are the jobs that we find the most essential and important, not the jobs that pay the most to those who work them. Personally I believe it is this way for a number of reasons. For farmers it is this way in order to maintain an unreasonable price for food. For retail it is this way because major corporations have total control over their workers because they are easily replaced. All of these jobs have their own reasons that I could dive into; however, I won\u2019t for the sake of brevity.

I\u2019m wondering why that\u2019s the case and if that has had any effect on the response our government has had to the Coronavirus. Essential and healthcare workers have bore the brunt of the responsibility throughout this entire pandemic. I believe that if these statistics where switched and men dominated these areas there would have been more steps taken to protect those workers (PPE, stimulus checks, childcare, etc.). The jobs dominated by men were largely unaffected in the fact that they were mostly told to stay home\u2014 a much more favorable situation to be in during a pandemic.",

The 52% of all essential workers being women makes it seem like they are just over half the essential workforce, but examining the highly skewed number of women in the social work and health care scene makes it obvious that there are obvious differences in the population of women in certain fields (with some having a greater risk of COVID in the case of interaction-heavy jobs like healthcare and social work). This being said, I wonder if woman essential workers are unproportionally contracting COVID at their workplace compared to their male counterparts. It also makes me wonder if we're going to see a shrink in the social work and healthcare work force, as I've seen headlines saying that women are quitting their jobs to take care of young children. I would say this graph tells me that in my Maryland suburb with a lot of nearby hospitals and health centers, there are probably a lot of kids who's mothers are working on-site rather than from home. If their husbands (in heterosexual relationships) are also working on-site or busy on their work-from-home workload, there is a huge need for comprehensive child care. A catchy headline would be: \"Case managers, IT workers, and welders: how gendered expectations of occupation may affect COVID contraction risk among men and women\".",

I also notice that there are so many women who are social workers, health care, and critical retail. I do not know why many women tend to be most of the essential workers in medicine, but my assumption is that the majority are made up of nurses since society sees nursing as a female profession. \n2.) As aforementioned, I wonder why we see more women in medicine and my hypothesis is that it is because the majority of them are in nursing, which is seen as a female profession. For the very bottom categories, I see that women are the lowest percentages, meaning that transit, defense, and resource extraction are male dominated jobs.\n3.) This has the impact of socially separating men and women by the profession that they work. When children grow up, they should not be taught to stick to professions that fit gender norms. Instead, men and women should be taught that they can do anything they want, and this study is living proof of that failure. \n4.) The graph demonstrates the range in women in certain professions with the top being medicine, social workers, and critical retail. The bottom is artillery professions that require brute forces like military, resource extraction, and transit. A catchy headline can be \"Women: Gender Norm Contributors or Gender Norm Breakers?\"",

This influences the overall percentage of essential workers who are female because such a large percentage of women work in health care, the largest category. \n2.)

Since the jobs held by most women at the top are jobs that require education it shows the inequality women still face in the job market when applying for jobs that aren't designed to require women's traditional motherly values.\n\nA catchy headline could be: The Pandemic Has People Wondering: How Far Have Women Really Come?",

However, the number of women drop in the other fields where they are greatly dominated by men, such as defense, law enforcement, farmers, and IT services. I wonder if this is due to hiring practices or a belief held by women that they can't pursue careers in these fields. This also can be a sign that men aren't as encouraged to pursue careers in the non-doctoral (?) medicine and caring fields as women are. I also wonder if the graph is misleading. The graph shows how many of the workers in that field are women but doesn't really include data about the total number. With differing sizes in workforces for different fields, the data may be interpreted differently with more information added. I also am not sure if the \"Total Workers\" column to the right refers to the number of women or actual total including men, which could help answer my previous question. This impacts me and my community because it can inform us of the disparities between different genders in different fields. School and human resource programs can use this information to level the playing field and encourage more men and women to join fields not dominated by their genders.

Nothing wrong with that obviously, I'd just like to know the reasoning behind that. The impact that this graph has on me and the community is that it shows people that the so called \"male\" jobs could and will be done by women as well.  They're just as good or even better compared to the men.

This explains my second question, but I still want to know why so many women are skewed towards being a social worker or helath care professional, and so few towards resource extraction, law enforcement, farming, and other occupations near the bottom of the graph.\n\nOr maybe that's just my introversion talking.\n\n3.

Would that data entry drive the average percentage of women in the essential workforce upwards?

It is rational that only 14 percent of people in the defense profession are women, it is a rare sight to see one take any part in the military. It is even more logical that 77 percent of healthcare workers are made up of women. Nurses are generally women, not men. Averaging all the averages, around half of the necessary professions are female. These examples mean that the world has progressed regarding gender. Meaning, people now accept women into society substantially more than they used to.

You'll notice that the jobs aren't listed, top to bottom, in order of number of workers--they're listed in order of percentage female workers. This is why you have social workers--78% women but only 2,320,000 total workers--above health care workers--77% women and 19,090,000 total workers. If they were listed by total workers, health care would be at the top, but since there's a greater percentage of female social workers than female health care workers, social workers are at the top.\n\nThis is why farmers are so low on the list--not because there aren't many farmers, but because there aren't many women in farming. If you look at the total number of workers, farmers would actually rank a little above the middle of the graph. \n\nAnd keep in mind that while farmers are definitely some of the most essential workers we have, that doesn't mean you need that many of them. A single farm can produce food for thousands at once, whereas a single doctor can only save one person at once. The number of workers in a particular job isn't necessarily linked to how essential their work is.",
