While staying at home, many people were on computer, whether for completing school or work remotely or simply to pass the time, and the internet provides ads for things like online shopping constantly. Naturally, with a large lack of excitement, in-person shopping, and fun things to spend money on, people were drawn into these ads and indulged in online retailing, myself included. Another thing that I expected was the increase in demand for hobbies, sporting goods, musical instruments, and books because this time of home retreat provided extra time to pursue personal interests. While I thought these hobbies would definitely take the number two spot, I wasn't very surprised when I saw garden and building materials. Both of my parents indulged in new outdoor projects with the new excessive amount of time that was granted and the sum of the prices for materials was often in high amounts.\n\nOne retail sail change that shocked me was the increase in motor vehicles and parts. With the Stay at Home bill, I assumed not many people were using their car to travel places. While I am still unsure of the supporting conclusion for the increase for motor vehicles, I could guess that it may be because some took up fixing their cars with their excess time.",

What interested me is that gardening sales increased. I believe this is happening because it gives people something to do during these strange times plus they don\u2019t have to go to grocery stores as much. Another thing that I didn\u2019t expect to plummet in sales was sports equipment. Most sports leagues are being shut down due to the virus, but I think people would buy more equipment because they are bored from being inside all day. My little cousin Tyler was really getting into basketball before the virus hit. He was so excited to play and then it was cancelled. This left him super bored with nothing to do so his parents went out and bought his own basketball and goal for himself to play in this driveway. This is what I expected most parents would do so their kid isn\u2019t constantly nagging in their ear about being bored.",

It seems primarily that bigger markets and retailers are not receiving much change in sales and such following the pandemic. Lots of smaller type businesses seem to be greatly effected in terms of finical status.\n     I think. the reason for this is that lots of major mass retailers do the majority of their business online.

    "comment info": "1. When viewing this graph, the main thing that I notice is that it is extremely hard to comprehend and understand. Although I can see the changes in retail sales, I feel as if I have a very difficult time grasping the contents of the graph. However, after a solid viewing session of said graph, I noticed that in the previous month there was a HUGE increase in the sale of food service/drink places. I also noticed that there was a huge increase in clothing and gas station sales.\n\n2. To be quite honest, I wonder what this graph is about. As I said before it was extremely hard for me to comprehend this graph due to the organization of the data. If I can look past the difficulty of viewing the graph, I would say that I wonder why there is such a difference in several of the main categories of retail [clothing, food, gas stations, and sporting goods]. I wonder if the pandemic is the reason for said difference or if there are other extenuating circumstances that affect the sale of certain goods and services.\n\n3. This graph, although hard to read, has a decent impact on my community and me personally because I believe that I--along with members of my community--almost fall directly into the categories of this graph. I know that I have spent a significant less amount of time and money on goods and services now compared to a year ago. I believe that the pandemic has significantly impacted the way the worlds spends their money.\n\n4. The Pandemic: More Than a Health Problem",

For example, sports goods/hobbies/musical instruments/book category percentage went from +11.1 in sales to -5.7%. I understand that many people during the pandemic would not be purchasing sports goods or musical instruments because many of the practices that require those types of things were closed or shut down but I was surprised that books were in that same category because I would think that with many people at home, everyone would be looking for things to keep them occupied and reading would be one of them. Another category that I found interesting was the sales of gas. The sales of gas increased. I know of many people that were still leaving the house during the pandemic because they are considered essential workers. I also think that many people were leaving the house going to get things like takeout or going to the grocery store or pharmacies, which would require gas. Although knowing this, still  many people were working from home therefore I am surprised that the gas sales would have increased. There are many people in my community that own small businesses that were forced to close due to the pandemic and they were never able to reopen. This is extremely sad and disappointing to those who are rely on these businesses to pay for their bills.

For example, online shopping (nonstore retailers) has gained significant popularity. Also, it's worth looking into how many layers this data has. If just the \"total retail sales\" were being considered, the increase wouldn't be as prominent, but taking a step back from the bigger picture allows you to see the layers. Looking at the electronics/appliances category makes me wonder if we're seeing just the bigger picture for the technology grouping. I would've expected people to be buying more electronics (specifically more personal devices such as phones, laptops, TVs, etc) during this time, but the first graph shows a slight decrease. \n\nTaking all of these factors into account makes me think about how my community might have been affected. For instance, many food service/drink places and gas stations have seen a significant decrease in sales when compared to the previous year. It makes me wonder how local restaurants or gas stations have been doing these past few months. \n\nHeadline: \nGlobal Pandemic: How Consumer Spending Has Changed in the US",

I believe the COVID-19 pandemic is the most obvious and most likely reason for this increase. This impacts my community and I because with the pandemic, it is important that we all stay safe and healthy and have the resources and methods to ensure we do this. Citizens in many places across the country are required to wear a mask in public and are asked to wash their hands with soap and use hand sanitizer. People are buying large amounts of whatever they think is necessary to ensure their health and safety. Alongside the dangers of the pandemic and the necessity of staying healthy, i believe it also brought more awareness to people about their hygiene and how to keep up with it. All of these reasons support why there has been an increase in sales in this category. I wonder if there will be a decline in sales once the pandemic is over and there is a cure found.",

What I notice about the graph is that comparison from the August compared from the previous year to now is that there has been mainly a decrease in retail sales but non-store retailers stayed the same. On the total retail sales it had an opposite  affect where total resales were previously decreased and currently it increased.\n\n2. What I wonder is could this get to normal seeing that non-retail store stayed the same and retails increasing because of it could this change peoples view on going out and buying personally. What I wonder is why non-retail stores stayed a constant instead of going up.\n\n3. What does this have on the community is small businesses and other businesses as well that are not non-store retailers making them go down making there value go down. Since their value goes down less jobs for those who work in those areas.\n\n4. Whats going in this graph is that more people are onto non- store retailer shopping for consumer goods and other goods. This can be seen in the graph where non-store retailers stayed at a constant while other decreased and total retail sales increased due to the non-store.

The first thing I saw on the graph was the huge decline of sporting goods, hobbies, books, and musical instruments. That is probably because the nation was basically shut down and sports and out of school activities were cancelled. Then after looking deeper into the graph I noticed that a lot of self improvement, home, and updating inclines. People are spending more time at home so they realize what needs to be fixed or improved. At first when I saw that food service/ drink service places had a large increase I was confused. We have been at home all of this time, right? But, it says this august and stores are more open so people are eager to get out of the house and go eat out, and have good food and drinks. Clothing is up because of back to school shopping or just clothes shopping because everyone changed in some way over quarantine. This change definitely hurt the stores in the area that are only local or even bigger stores because they are getting much less customers and losing money.

On the other hand, clothing stores, food service, and other appliances are experiencing an increase and my assumption is that's due to online shopping. I wonder if people find it necessary to order online or if online shopping is becoming the new norm since people can no longer go out unless they are wearing a mask. The impact on my community is that since the pandemic it is making people less active and more likely to stay indoors for a prolonged period of time. The problem with this is that people are not stretching their legs when they typically go shopping online. In this graph, we can see that there is an increase in online shopping within the last month. Catchy headline: \"Online Shopping: Laziness, or the New Normal?\"",

Gas stations are getting less sales because people are inside more and don't drive as much, food services/ fast food and clothing shopping are not necessities and not worth the risk of getting sick.  Nonstore retailers (online retailers) and hobby items/equipment have increased in sales. Although hobbies are not necessities, people that are quarantined are bored and have nothing to do, so they decide to use up their extra time with things they would not have had much time for before like reading books, playing instruments, or gardening. In the last month food services and clothing stores have made somewhat of a resurgence in sales, this could either mean the coronavirus threat is subsiding ,or, people are just getting fed up with quarantine.

In July 2020, during the pandemic, it is clear how people have chosen to devote themselves to personal care and that of their homes, as the categories of healthcare, furniture and building materials/ garden have experienced an increase in sales. This makes me imagine that families wanted to reorganize their spaces so as to change the atmosphere of their houses and then to spend money on clothing and furniture, rather than shop on some other thinks  like sporting goods/ hobbies/musical instruments/ books/, which instead was a decreasing economic sector. I really wonder how it is possible, since during my quarantine period, I did nothing but reading or devote myself to my hobbies, like work out or painting. Another thing that surprised me was seeing how this year there was a sharp increase in food services/drink places sales, but I guess it is because a lot of people, after the lockdown period, decided to try new places to meet with friends or work colleagues. However, the situation in the United States makes me wonder which economic sectors in my country have experienced an increase or decrease in sales, as the current situation is quite serious for the economy of Italy: cases of covid-19 are increasing and people choose to save their money in view of a possible second lockdown.",

I was under the impression that the economy was suffering more drastically as a result of the pandemic, and I'm sure it was during earlier months and more intense quarantine, however, total retail sales have gone up 2.6% compared with last August. It makes sense that there was a big increase in sales for gardening materials, hobbies, and health care, however, some of the other increases in spending surprised me and I was additionally surprised that some of the decrease percentages aren't higher. I wonder how May 2019 and May 2020 would compare because this was the peak of quarantine and I would be interested to see how much total retail was down. This impacts me because it shows me that although certain industries as striving, many businesses are also struggling financially as a result of the virus. Local businesses struggling affects the whole community. A more personal impact is that gas prices have greatly decreased, allowing me to save money.

And I also imagine that many stores had to close because for a manager could be very hard to give a salary to each worker when they had to close the store for a long period.\nI think that graphs like this help a lot to understand which sectors are economically in difficulty as a consequence of the pandemic.",

It seemed rather strange to me and I wondered how it was possible since the restrictions caused by the covid.  \nHowever I was not surprised by the percentage increase regarding health/ personal care and building materials/garden. \nSubsequently I wondered why the sector hobbies is decreased since, at least as far as I am concerned, I used my time during the pandemic to read books or play the guitar. Later I pondered why this graph had been made and in my opinion the purpose is understand which sectors need the most help from the State. \nLastly looking these percentages made me think about my community.

It is noticeable how specific categories of objects have been more shopped: books, health/personal care things, gardening tools and many other objects have increased their sale. This is a clear consequence of Americans having more time to dedicate to their selves and their houses. In fact, clothing sales, restaurants and gas stations have suffered heavy losses compared to last year due to people staying at home. However I wonder if and when this sectors will manage to significantly rise in sales in order to overcome the crisis. I am sure my country is in a similar situation and that is why being quarantined again really scares me.",

This makes sense since many people prefer to purchase products online because of the pandemic. I also noticed that the greatest magnitude of change last year was a 22.4% increase for nonstore retailers, the greatest magnitude of change this past month was a 5.7% loss in hobbies, etc. 7 of the categories completely changed direction compared to their retails from the previous year. I wonder why certain bars have percentages while the rest of the numbers are left plain. I wonder why food services and gas stations increased in sales whereas food/drink stores decreased in sales, considering the restrictions of the pandemic. Regarding food services, would retail include takeout/delivery or just dine-in? Moreover, I find it interesting how sales for health/personal care were less compared to the previous year as well as hobbies. Since people are spending this time to focus on themselves and things such as home improvement, I wonder why people aren't spending on hobbies. This graph represents how the current pandemic has affected retail of both my community and communities around the country, as business has declined compared to online retailers.

The drastic increase in nonstore retailers (which do not require a person to physically leave their homes in order to purchase goods) and materials for homes, hobbies, and creativity demonstrate that Americans spent their time inside. Many people ate indoors, marked by the reduced sales at restaurants and other food/drink locations. A decrease in travel can be inferred by the drop in gas station sales. While there is virtually no change between July and August 2020 it is clear that people slowly began to abandon at home activities to indulge in in-store shopping, restaurant outings, and the like. August 2020 shows signs of the public attempting to return to some semblance of normalcy. To my curiosity, electronics/appliances retail sales did not experience as much change as other retail forms. While many of these results make sense conceptually on a larger scale, I do not see my specific community yielding results this dramatic (except for maybe in the food/drink places section). This causes me to wonder what (if any) communities had the greatest effects on the data presented.\n\nPossible Headline: Staying Home Makes an Economy Lazy",

I also noticed that the things that one my expect to increase with the pandemic such as building materials/garden and sporting goods/hobbies/musical instruments/books increased. On the same thought, those categories that one might expect to decrease such as clothing, gas stations, and food service-drink places decreased. \nI wonder why some of the numerical data is presented as a percentage while the majority are just normal numbers. I also wonder what would fall under nonstore retailers as I would imagine this includes online shopping among other things.\n\nIn regards to my community, I think this graphic might help people to understand how exactly this pandemic has affected different fields of retail and possibly encourage them to support retail fields that may be struggling right now.\n\nCatchy phrase: \"Impact of Corona on Consumer Spending: Is this what you expected?\"",

I think that the sporting good stores/hobby stores have had their retail sales go down so much is because people are scared to go into stores, especially the ones that are not essential. I wonder why the gas stations had an increase of sales even when people are not driving places as much as they used to.

Though both nonstore retail and retail sales have been up, nonstore retail is taking over as a new way to buy. I found it concerning that gas prices have been well over sales from last year. I wonder why that could be if currently there are less plces to go and drive a car anyway. Maybe people are over quarantining in their house? This does have a big impact on my community because if less people are physically shopping, then the workers will get paid less as there are none to serve.

    "comment info": "By looking at the graph I can instantly see the difference between this year and last year\u2019s spending. I first noticed how much consumer spending percentages have gone down due to the pandemic. When everything was first shut down many Americans were not out buying things because we weren\u2019t allowed to. That caused many small businesses to struggle financially and many are still recovering from it. I wonder how long it will take for business and big corporations to fully recover and gain how much money they lost back. This virus will be here for a while so more damage is most likely going to be done. This greatly impacts my town because we are a big tourist attraction, especially in the summer. If many people aren\u2019t traveling due to restrictions, our town loses double the amount of money considering the people who actually live here can\u2019t go out and buy much. The movie theaters have reclosed again as a result of financial issues. I know of a few stores where I live that have shut down because of this pandemic and it is sad to see great businesses close.",

Many of these make sense due to the pandemic. For example food services most likely went up in August because this is when places started to open back up from being shut down during quarantine. It also makes sense as to why the furnishing and building materials went up also. Many people renovated their homes during quarantine because they had the extra time to. Lastly, this can also be a major reason as to why the clothing sales went up in the past month.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why the sporting goods/hobbies sales went down by so much from last year to this month? Maybe it can be because many people ran out of books or hobbies to try in the last month since that it is what most people were doing during quarantine. \n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis impacts my community because many local businesses are struggling financially from being closed during the pandemic. It is good to see that as a community we are all making the effort to go to food services to help them recover from this.\n\nA headline for this graph could be: \nChanges In Retail? Blame Corona.",

At first, some of the information seemed a little weird and inaccurate, but the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. For example, I was pretty confused when I saw that total retail sales on gas had gone up, but if you think about it, it isn't surprising at all. Airports are a lot less popular because of COVID, so people are driving when they want to travel. I traveled a lot but drove everywhere to do it and went to more isolated places. A lot of people I know did the same thing, so this stat, like some of the others on the graph, makes a lot more sense after a little analysis.  The one thing that did confuse me was the sports/hobbies/instruments category. I can understand why spending on sports went down, as practices and games were canceled, but I feel like spending on things like instruments and other materials needed for hobbies would've gone up. I know I definitely had more time for hobbies, so this was the only one that didn't really make sense to me.  Obviously, COVID has affected our way of life as a whole, but our spending habits were one of the most changed things overall.",

The data in the graph is not surprising. It is expected that when people stay home, they spend less money in malls and gas stations.

Some examples of things it hurt were sporting goods places, food/drink stores, general merchandise, and just miscellaneous items. These places that are being hurt are examples of items people are just not in need of currently because of the pandemic. Some things were much more prevalent during the pandemic like building/gardening materials, furniture, and food service/drink places. That last aspect might surprise you. Why would people be going to food service/drink places during a pandemic? Well the answer is that most people see that things are starting to open and are just excited to get back and in and eat out again. Small businesses will be hurt because there is no need to go out to small stores and be exposed to COVID-19 when you could just stay in your house and order it online. I feel that the use of online retailers will not just stop after the pandemic, I feel that it will keep on being the normal way to shop for most people.

    "comment info": "Covid has shifted the economy quite a bit comparing to the previous year as people invested other things that aren\u2019t usually bought for Americans under a pandemic. The explanation for this most likely is people have shifted their attention to other things since the pandemic keeps them occupied with different things. For example, people aren\u2019t traveling as much so there is no incentive to buy new clothes or get more gas. The previous months are quite similar as there is little to no change which shows that this is what the people are gonna buy at similar rates to the previous months. This hurts some businesses and helps them. The clothing, gas, and the food industry has certainly taken a major hit to their profits. I do wonder why people spent more on motor vehicles and parts 4.5% more than last year. I suspect this will hurt small businesses in my area that revolves around gas, clothing, and food services. This graph shows areas prospering and other areas being utterly crippled to sum this up would be \u201cThe Yin and Yang Economy\u201d.",

What I am more concerned about is what the lasting impact of this will be. After one, two, or ten years, will the economy return to what it once was, or has covid permanently shifted it?\n\nPersonally, I have a feeling most of the changes will thin out over time, but that there will be more permanent market shifts. People get used to different things and learn what parts of the economy were going under/were not worth going up. For example, nonstore retailers and online services may go significantly higher from now on because of COVID. But that's just my guess; I could be totally wrong and nothing changes at all, or maybe the market is permanently altered/broken/renewed. There are countless possibilities.",

A good example is the sports industry in the graph, who saw huge impacts compared to the previous year. There was one thing that surprised me, and this was the fact that many businesses sales still increased. As an example the hardware/building retail stores still increased and my family was an example of that. My family had nothing else better to do so we spent lots of time at Home Depot getting supplies for home improvement.

The clothing has gone up because Mrs. Lucas-as a female- said that females have grown a little in the weight category and are needing new clothes. That is just a sample of what makes sense to me. The thing I don\u2019t get, is why gas stations are going up. Last year gas stations were15.4 in sales and last month they were +0.4 in sales. Where are people going last month than in last year? Last year people had to drive to work, drop off/pick up their kid(s) at/from school run errands etc. not going out to eat because the food serves/ drink places are going up. Not going to stores because all the sails are down on the graph. Another thing that I thought that was interesting was how last year the sales went high to low.

But, the places like clothing stores gas stations and restaurants sales seemed to drop.\n       I wonder where all the data was acquired. Another thing I wonder is why non- store retailers are in a different section when they sell similar products then retailers. \n       The that it has on my community is that lots of in store shopping is closed do to COVID-19. So, if the sales drop then stores and restaurants may close down. Which that has encouraged lots of stores to open online retail.\n          I think what is actually going on in the graph is the growth of online sales due to COVID-19.",

    "comment info": "Above is a graph comparing last year's retail sales in August to this year's retail sales in August. You can see there is a major difference in certain areas, for example: The sporting goods/ hobbies/ musical instruments/ books retail dropped 16.8% in the past year. If people are staying home all the time then you would assume the retail percentages would be at their peak in this area. \n     Food service/ drink places increased 20% in the past year, this can be because people are going out and buying food rather than cooking food, or people are supporting local businesses and buying food from there. Retail in clothing increased by 23%, this is probably due to gyms being closed and not being able to exercise properly so people are gaining weight and buying new clothes. Or it can be the opposite, people can find quarantine as a time to lose weight so they are losing weight and buying new clothes to fit themselves. \n     The community I am in has many local businesses, or main staple is local businesses. Some have had to close down because of the Coronavirus. In my town, every April, we have a festival. This is where small businesses make most of their money for the year because people from all walks of life come and buy things. But this year, the festival was canceled, they lost their biggest shot of the year to make some money. It was a struggle they would soon have to face for the rest of 2020.",

As an example, more and more people are going out less which means less money for fast food restaurants and more money for grocery stores. Its the same reason why gas stations, clothing brands, and electronics are declining in sales. As you can see people are less worried about spending while going out, and more worried about spending on what matters to them in the long run of things.",

As a result, establishments like restaurants, gas stations, and clothing stores have seen a decline in sales. However, nonstore retailers have seen a large increase in sales because people have more time on their hands. This virus has given people the chance to not only enjoy their old hobbies, but find some new ones. \n     Despite the positive effect this pandemic has had on nonstore retailers, a lot of local businesses have been suffering. That could mean some of my favorite restaurants and stores could shut down. The other day, I heard one of my favorite shopping centers is going close due to lack of sales. That completely broke my heart. I used to go there to shop with my friends all the time. As afraid as we are to catch Covid, it's important that we find ways to support our local businesses.",

What do you notice?\n\nI notice that the creator chose to orient the list from greatest increase to greatest decrease over the year rather than from month to month.\nUnsurprisingly, retail sales of hobby and home items have increased since August 2019, while places like gas stations, clothing stores, and restaurants have seen drops in sales. \n\n2. What do you wonder? \n\nI wonder where this data was obtained from. I also wonder why non-store retailers have a separate category while they sell similar items to other retailers. How would the graph change if this weren't the case? Lastly, why did the creator of this graph feel it would be more beneficial to compare yearly v.s. monthly?\n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\n\nStores close to me may choose to alter their inventory as they reopen. If sales drop too much, stores (especially restaurants) may close. Stores that do not have an online presence may be forced to create a website to stay alive in a changing market.\n\n4. What\u2019s going on in this graph?

Some of the things like food service/drink places, gas stations, and clothing are down because people are less eager to travel and go shopping, but instead enjoy time at home spending time with their families. Because people enjoy spending time at home, non store retailers, gardening, hobbies, and all sorts of home furnishings are up in 2020. In the past month not many things have changed. We are still stuck at home and still trying to get used to living in a new normal. One thing I found interesting is that hobbies in the past month are down 5.7%. I guess this means that people already have the necessary equipment to enjoy their hobbies and are just enjoying using those hobbies using those same things.",

Next, comparing to this previous year, good services, gas stations, and clothing all decreased. However, in this past month have begun increasing again. I wonder why in this past month, sporting goods/hobbies/musical instruments/books has decreased in retail sales, because it would seem that more people would be outdoors doing activities or reading a book. I also wonder why building materials and gardens has increased durastically. The impact that I have noticed is an increase in prices. Grocery stores have increased their prices, while other things have been on sale or cheaper. Lots of clothing brands have been putting different discounts or offers up for individuals to see and buy. In my community, I see smaller food businesses struggling as less individuals are going out for food. \nMy catchy headline is \"Are Clothing Stores Dying? What else has crashed in 2020?\"",

Characteristically, things that you do from home are up, like people buying bikes and gardening. Food/drink stores are also up from last year. This makes sense because restaurants haven\u2019t been open. Overall, people are spending more money on things and activities related to their home than on things related to outside of their house. I can agree with this. My family has done a different amount of home improvement projects. However, with school starting again, I can see this changing in my day-to-day life. I wonder how businesses who are struggling are dealing with this shift in spending. I wonder how much longer home activities will be on the positive side of the graph when you can already see sporting goods/hobbies are already starting to move down and restaurants and clothing are starting to trend up. In the past week, I\u2019ve gone clothes shopping with my mom and my dad bought some electronics to better his work space. In my own community, I know people are trying to support local restaurants because they are struggling with people not going out to eat as much. My parents both work for companies that haven\u2019t been extraordinarily affected in the fluctuations in this economy.

Most of the things that increased were either things to cure the boredom of quarantine such as sporting goods, gardening stuff and more.

I see that sales for hobby supplies have increased from last year but decreased from this year. The opposite effect is apparent with food service, gas stations, and clothing.\nI wonder whether people going back to work/school has caused a reversal in sales compared to last year and compared to last month (shown with gas stations, food service, clothing, and hobby supplies). Why were electronics and appliances down from last year? I would have expected the opposite effect because of people working and going to school at home on top of using their appliances more.\nThis has a huge impact on my community. The huge increase in sales from nonstore retailers has caused issues with our own small businesses. With restaurants doing so poorly in the beginning, many places where I had memories have closed.\nMy title for the graph would be \"A Change in Extra Change: How the Coronavirus Has Impacted Consumer Spending\".",

You would think these would still be in high demand since we\u2019re all still stuck at home. I also find it confounding that foodservice and drink places are still going up even with social distancing guidelines. I think it shows how people aren\u2019t really following safety guidelines and are prolonging the pandemic. The non-store retailers and gardening supplies aren\u2019t that surprising either since many people have stepped out of their comfort zone and begun gardening. It\u2019s also interesting to see that clothing has also been on the rise after a large decline last year. I find it strange that the health/personal care products haven\u2019t gone up more, as we should be taking time to take care of ourselves.\n One thing I notice is that mainly necessities seem to be on the rise. Maybe this is because people are losing their jobs at alarming rates and can only pay for the bare minimum. Thinking from that perspective makes this graph more impactful. It makes me wonder how many children will miss Christmas or their birthdays because their parents, who have previously been in a financially stable place, can barely afford to keep them fed. Their parents, who haven\u2019t been able to take care of themselves either. There also isn\u2019t rise or fall of over 5.7%, which is showing how our economy is a little frozen.

I notice that the electronic purchases went down during the pandemic which was very surprising because I figured in quarantine more people would tend to use electronics more, especially for distance learning. In a way, this is good because many people would rather take up a hobby like a musical instrument and it is good to see that the numbers are rising for these things.\n2. I wonder why clothing purchases have gone down by so much. When stores are shut I would expect people to shop for clothes online but I guess these avid shoppers might have stopped.\n3.This impacts my community because it shows how local businesses are thriving even in these tough times. It shows a spark of hope for our economy going deeper into quarantine.\n4. Title: Covid vs The economy: Who will thrive?",

The past year is shown in light orange, while the past month is darker orange. The data conveyed in these two colors are almost opposite of each other. The current pandemic is the prominent factor to the increase and decrease in consumer spending. With a downfall in the economy and high rates of unemployment, less spending in the past several month has occurred. As adults are beginning work again and children back in school (on campus or online), there is less time for the hobbies acquired during quarantine. Online shopping has been popular for a while, but even more so during COVID. It increase significantly in the previous year and had no change in the previous month. Since traveling and public places are restricted, gas stations had a major decrease in sales. I wonder why non-store retailers had no change. Why has health/personal care not increased in the previous month? In my community I have noticed that more buildings are being built and more construction is happening. In the previous month, building materials/garden has increased by 2%. A catchy headline that relates to the graph would be \u201cRetail Sales Consumed by COVID.\u201d",

I also noticed that people are now spending a lot less on gas, clothing, and food services. This is an effect of people are staying home more due to practicing social distancing.

    "comment info": "At first I was kind of confused as to why hobby items such as sporting goods and instrument sales went down. When you think about it, during this time you have a huge opportunity to take up some single person hobbies that you have been wanting to try. So why would the numbers go down this month? Well, most of the time, if you purchase quality goods for these hobbies, you don't need to but items for a while. For example, I play the flute. I don't need to get a new flute every month because flutes last long if you take care of them. So, sales are probably down, not because people lost interest, but because you don't need to buy those items as often as groceries. Just because you didn't buy something, doesn't mean you are using the same thing at home. \n\n\nAlso, I wasn't surprised that gardening materials were on a rise. I say this because you have more time to tend to the plants and take care of a garden. Personally, my family started a garden during the pandemic because we wanted something new to try. Ours didn't work out too well once I started school, but many others also had the same idea. Also, if you want to support locals, check out your local plant nurseries. \n\nOne thing that also kind of surprised me was the rise in clothing this previous month. One reason this may be is because people have either been losing or gaining weight depending on the habits they have picked up in quarantine. The only other reason I can think of would be a change in style due to media influence",

    "comment info": "When looking at the graph, I notice the pandemic has greatly impacted retail. There are both areas of increased and decreased sales. The area of retail that has experienced the most dramatic change is non store retail. This makes sense to me, because the pandemic has caused many shops to close or switch to online only, forcing people to purchase goods online. Personally, I can relate to this statement, as my family has been ordering many things online since the pandemic began. Another section of retail that has increased, is building/garden materials. This, once again, makes sense. While being stuck at home, many people decide to tackle home improvement or gardening projects, explaining the higher demand for these products. My mother has purchased many of these items in the process of renovating our backyard. She had become bored while being stuck inside, and decided it would be a good task. I find it interesting that hobby materials have dropped in sales since July. While discussing this in class, my peers came to the conclusion that people were no longer in need of these materials, as they had already done the majority of purchasing at the beginning of the pandemic. While I find this to be a reasonable idea, I wonder if this is truly the cause. If anything, I feel that sales would be higher due to school returning. A catchy title for this graph is \u201cRetail VS Pandemic.\u201d It indicates that the graph is showing the effect this pandemic has had on retail.",

People started to react differently and stay away from outside activities such as restaurants and shopping. For example, their reaction was to use online shopping instead of malls, and for restaurants more and more people are eating from their houses. However, their are some people in restaurants such as Fast Food restaurants. Also I am very puzzled how gas retail sales are growing considering that less and less people are going out. One catchy head line is \"Dramatic Changes in Retail Sales\". I also realized that Food services are going up maybe because  millions of people don't have food during the pandemic, so they are dependent on the Food Department, which is why it is going up.  To add on,more and more people are dependent on food services. I also noticed that hobbies are going down. This also puzzled me because I thought that hobbies should go up, considering that more people then before a couple months ago are at home. To add on, I also thought that more hobbies are being developed in the process during quarantine. During the Pandemic there has been a lot of changes regarding the retail sales.",

    "comment info": "What I notice in this graph is that people are spending their money differently during the pandemic. Hobbies and interests, as well as food and drink, seem to have dropped the most. I wonder why money spent on clothing has increased, however, as people should be out shopping less during quarantine, not more. I think that less spending on particularly hobbies/interests, and food and drink will lead to many small businesses closing, and people who work at them losing their jobs.  It may also make people more depressed, as they aren't exploring their interests. A catchy headline could be \"The Collapse of Consumer Interests.\"",

One of the only sales areas that has increased is general merchandise, because a lot of people are buying more things for themselves as they are stuck at home. Many people are now buying more goods online so that they do not risk being infected. I wonder if needs for gas services and food will shoot up once Covid dies down.",

However, the most drastic changes are the decrease in sporting goods/hobbies/musical instruments/books and the increase in food service. I wonder why people are going out to eat more during the pandemic, and why, if we're spending so much time inside, are people not buying supplies to have fun while socially distancing? This means that public areas such as restaurants are more crowded while there are less people reading, playing instruments, and doing sports at home. This might mean a surge in COVID-19 infections in my community. A catchy headline for this graph would be 'Change in Consumer Spending Before and After Pandemic.'",

This could either be really good because it means people aren't buying sports equipment because they are staying inside and quarantining.  Or it could mean people aren't buying musical instruments and books because they are just sitting around all day on computers or watching tv or sleeping.  And this means people aren't doing anything all day and this could lead to a dangerous mental health state.  And sadly, I think that the graph is representing the later.",

Like some people that live alone don't have anyone to check up on them to make sure that they have their lives together, which means they could waste their days away doing nothing at all which could leave them in a not very positive and productive mental state.",

As it is easy to see on the graph, during the pandemic people have decided to completely enter their \u201cComfort-zone\u201d, without thinking about themselves. Health has deteriorated. Due to a blockade, the government had to try to protect the people from Covid-19, but without using their time to cure themselves, more than from the virus. My advice is to use the time available at best even when you are busy or in a lockdown. In these cases you can study to keep your mind in training or improve your physical appearance, to stay healthy.",

The category also includes sporting good, musical instruments and books.  What other reasons could there be for this decline?  Their change in sales may not be all going in the same direction.\n\nIn comparing the two graphs, there are six categories, like the sporting goods category, that change direction \u2013 either they had an increase in sales as compared to the previous year and now have a decrease or had a decrease and now have an increase.  You may want to look at these categories and wonder what is happening in each of these. You may want to share your conjectures.",
