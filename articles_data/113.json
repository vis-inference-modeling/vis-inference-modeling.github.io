A possible headline for this graph is \"The change of median net worth over time has been changing a lot since the 1990's\". What I see that makes me say this is the change that first starts from 1992 to 1995. After that, the graph begins to change. There's also another graph that started in 1998 that has been improving since. This can relate to my community because we all have families. This can display the change in money over the years for families. It makes me wonder if the yellow graph will keep increasing or changing. This is based on the 1st graph",

I wonder what was going on from 1992 to 1995 that made all the top ten percent less rich but all families increased. This relates to my community now that prices for everything have increased by double or more but the pay is still about the same. This graph shows the change in median net worth since 1989 for the top 10 percent and then for all families.",

The jarringly obvious thing that jumps out is that rich people in 2016 were doing fantastically. The increase in their wealth is high. I also notice that in 2016 the rest of the world was having a very small increase in wealth percentage after the recession. One thing that is important to note is that this graph is not about during the pandemic, but the years preceding the pandemic to try and outline possible trends that could occur.\nI wonder if the economic bounceback from this historic event will be similar to that of the recession for average families. There was a flatline in the graph the years after the recession but then an increase. I know that the rich right now just keep getting richer, so will there be any sort of dip in their net worth?\nI know a lot of people that have quit their jobs because of this pandemic, myself included. I know these people are struggling for money and to make ends meet. I would hope, for their sake, the graph trend is right and that there will be a solid increase after the downtrend. I also know now that things are starting to open again people are spending more and helping small businesses. For business owners, this will probably show a little increase in their income. I know the lower-income people around me are struggling, so I don't know that they'll have the same return as the rest.\nTitle: Patterns: What We Know About Net Worth in Hard Times",
