In many Jewish marriages, women adopt their husband\u2019s surname as part of religious and cultural norms. However, hyphenating last names is pretty common in my community, often to honor both family names and maintain a connection to one\u2019s heritage. However, keeping a maiden name entirely is unheard of, as it may be seen as breaking from tradition.\nCatchy headline: \"Tying the Knot, Changing the Name?\"",

I know that Hispanic surnames are really important meaning - wise, especially in such family-centric cultures, so the carrying on of the familial history through the name could be one contributor of Hispanic women keeping their own name.

    "comment info": "There are a few trends I notice in the data presented, and I\u2019m interested to know the reasons behind them. Firstly, the demographic most likely to take their husbands names are white brides, while black and hispanic brides are increasingly less likely to take their husband\u2019s names. Black brides were by far the most likely to hyphenate their names, while Hispanic brides were the most likely to keep their maiden names. Of the white brides that did not take their husbands\u2019 names the majority kept their maiden name, rather than hyphenate. I could speculate this to reflect different cultural norms around marriage. Particularly, you could see the significant minority of white brides keeping their maiden names as representing the population of progressive educated professional white women and the 90% who don\u2019t as those who follow more traditional and Christian social moores, which is a division I\u2019ve noticed in my life and communities.",

I noticed that the demographics for the polling were very limited because it only included three races and only 2,000 women in heterosexual marriages. I wonder how different the results would have been if the polling had been opened up to a large pool of sexualities and races. I think those changes would make the results more representative of the women of the United States. This relates to me because my mom did not change her last name and it is interesting to see how much of a minority her choice was.

The percentages vary based on race. I notice that most women of all races take their spouse's last names. I think this is simply because of tradition. Although a fairly large percentage of Hispanic women kept their last name, this may suggest that this tradition of taking your spouse's last name is not very important to Hispanic culture. I wonder if their are other gender traditions that Hispanic culture does not follow. I notice that out of all women who hyphenate their last name, Black women make up the majority, even though it is only 16 percent. I wonder if as time passes, and as a society progress, fewer women will take their spouse's name. I additionally wonder if white women will be the last to completely switch, if there ever is a complete switch.

Amongst the white brides surveyed white women had the highest percentage of taking their spouse's last name at 86%. I wonder if divorce rates amongst different ethnicities have an effect on whether they take their partner's last name. I also wonder if the length of the relationship before getting married has an effect on whether the bride takes their partner's last name.  As a Hispanic I thought it would have the highest percentage of brides hyphenating their last name. Instead it was 7% less than black brides taking hyphenating their last name with their partners. In the future I believe more brides will begin to just keep their last name or hyphenate them. This is because as people are getting married less and getting married more later in their life they feel more attached to their name. Another reason is because it is becoming more socially acceptable for a bride to keep her last name. Furthermore, I am interested to see how this chart changes in the future, and the reasoning behind it.",

I'm curious why they didn't broaden this survey to include more cultures, which would provide more information if keeping one last name is a cultural phenomena.

The researchers separated these women into three categories based on their races (White, Black, and Hispanic). It is clear from this graph that the overwhelming majority of women take their spouse's name throughout all three races. However, out of all the races surveyed, Hispanic women were most likely to keep their last name as 30% of them chose to keep it compared to Black women (9%) and White (10%). While this graph only surveyed a tiny percentage of America's 332 million-person population, I think that Hispanic women's commitment to keeping their last name shows the pride that they have in maintaining their heritage, especially as a race that is so often discriminated against. Black women show similar respect for their heritage as 16% of Black women hyphenated their last names compared to 3% of White women and 9% of Hispanic women. This is interesting because I feel like I have never heard a hyphenated last name. I wonder how this graph would change if more people and races were included. For example, Asian women were left out of this graph as mentioned in the commentary. This relates to me because I am a young woman who hopes to get married one day, and eventually, will have to decide what to do with my last name. \n\"Name Norms after Marriage\"",

For example, this graph shows that statistically, the majority of white brides, end up taking their spouse\u2019s last name (86%). While a majority of Hispanic brides still take their spouse\u2019s last name (60%), Hispanic brides are the most likely to keep their maiden names at 30% compared to white brides (10%) and Black brides (9%). What I wonder is why this survey was so limited. I understand this was a voluntary survey and only 2,740 American brides responded. Even though it was conducted by the Pew Research Center, a reliable source, it does not accurately represent women across America 68.45 million married women across America. Plus, this graph only pertains to same-sex couples and does not include Asian or Indigenous people. I wonder how much this graph would fluctuate if more people responded and more groups were represented. This relates to my community because as a young woman surrounded by other young women, if we choose to get married, we all have to one day decide the fate of our last names. More and more women feel less pressure to have to change their name to please their husbands and decaying, misogynistic societal standards.

While only 1 in 10 black or white women keep their name, around 1 in 3 Hispanic women do, which is a huge leap. Maybe it's for a cultural reason? I think that Hispanic families tend to be more close-knit, and many Hispanic people live in intergenerational households.

Of the white brides that did not take their husbands\u2019 names the majority kept their maiden name, rather than hyphenate.

I noticed that the demographics for the polling were very limited because it only included three races and only 2,000 women in heterosexual marriages. I wonder how different the results would have been if the polling had been opened up to a large pool of sexualities and races. I think those changes would make the results more representative of the women of the United States. This relates to me because my mom did not change her last name and it is interesting to see how much of a minority her choice was.

The percentages vary based on race. I notice that most women of all races take their spouse's last names. I think this is simply because of tradition. Although a fairly large percentage of Hispanic women kept their last name, this may suggest that this tradition of taking your spouse's last name is not very important to Hispanic culture. I wonder if their are other gender traditions that Hispanic culture does not follow. I notice that out of all women who hyphenate their last name, Black women make up the majority, even though it is only 16 percent. I wonder if as time passes, and as a society progress, fewer women will take their spouse's name. I additionally wonder if white women will be the last to completely switch, if there ever is a complete switch.

Amongst the white brides surveyed white women had the highest percentage of taking their spouse's last name at 86%. I wonder if divorce rates amongst different ethnicities have an effect on whether they take their partner's last name. I also wonder if the length of the relationship before getting married has an effect on whether the bride takes their partner's last name.  As a Hispanic I thought it would have the highest percentage of brides hyphenating their last name. Instead it was 7% less than black brides taking hyphenating their last name with their partners. In the future I believe more brides will begin to just keep their last name or hyphenate them. This is because as people are getting married less and getting married more later in their life they feel more attached to their name. Another reason is because it is becoming more socially acceptable for a bride to keep her last name. Furthermore, I am interested to see how this chart changes in the future, and the reasoning behind it.",

The researchers focused on women from three ethnic categories: White, Black, and Hispanic. The graph clearly shows that, no matter what ethnic background, the majority of women choose to take their partner's last name. \n\n However, out of everyone in the survey,Hispanic women were the  most likely to keep their last name with thirty percent of them keeping their name. In comparison only nine percent of  black women w and  ten percent of white women kept their name. I'm curious if Hispanic women keeping their own names has to do with culture. I'm curious why they didn't broaden this survey to include more cultures, which would provide more information if keeping one last name is a cultural phenomena.

The researchers separated these women into three categories based on their races (White, Black, and Hispanic). It is clear from this graph that the overwhelming majority of women take their spouse's name throughout all three races. However, out of all the races surveyed, Hispanic women were most likely to keep their last name as 30% of them chose to keep it compared to Black women (9%) and White (10%). While this graph only surveyed a tiny percentage of America's 332 million-person population, I think that Hispanic women's commitment to keeping their last name shows the pride that they have in maintaining their heritage, especially as a race that is so often discriminated against. Black women show similar respect for their heritage as 16% of Black women hyphenated their last names compared to 3% of White women and 9% of Hispanic women. This is interesting because I feel like I have never heard a hyphenated last name. I wonder how this graph would change if more people and races were included. For example, Asian women were left out of this graph as mentioned in the commentary. This relates to me because I am a young woman who hopes to get married one day, and eventually, will have to decide what to do with my last name. \n\"Name Norms after Marriage\"",

For example, this graph shows that statistically, the majority of white brides, end up taking their spouse\u2019s last name (86%). While a majority of Hispanic brides still take their spouse\u2019s last name (60%), Hispanic brides are the most likely to keep their maiden names at 30% compared to white brides (10%) and Black brides (9%). What I wonder is why this survey was so limited. I understand this was a voluntary survey and only 2,740 American brides responded. Even though it was conducted by the Pew Research Center, a reliable source, it does not accurately represent women across America 68.45 million married women across America. Plus, this graph only pertains to same-sex couples and does not include Asian or Indigenous people. I wonder how much this graph would fluctuate if more people responded and more groups were represented. This relates to my community because as a young woman surrounded by other young women, if we choose to get married, we all have to one day decide the fate of our last names. More and more women feel less pressure to have to change their name to please their husbands and decaying, misogynistic societal standards.

I think that Hispanic families tend to be more close-knit, and many Hispanic people live in intergenerational households.

This includes a 3% chance of White women who hyphenate their maiden and husband\u2019s last name, and only a low 10% who actually keep their maiden name. On the other hand, Hispanic women are least likely to take their spouse's name with a 60% chance, and a 30% chance of keeping their maiden name. While Black women are most likely to hyphenate their last name. I wonder if it is most common for Hispanic women to keep their maiden name because of the importance of family. This may be because with Hispanic tradition, a woman\u2019s last name is kept to carry their father\u2019s last name as an important part of their identity. Also, Hispanic women often keep both their maiden name and add their husband\u2019s last name on. Additionally, why are white women most likely to take their spouse\u2019s name? This relates to my community as last names are a part of a person\u2019s identity. When I get married, I will probably take my spouse\u2019s last name, but I wonder how this will change for my friends. \n\n\n\u201cFrom Miss to Mrs: Ditching or Keeping the Last Name\u201d",

Perhaps tradition dictates this trend. Furthermore, since Hispanic individuals often have more than one middle name, perhaps it is related to the bride's not changing their name. I wonder if fewer women will take their spouse's name in the future, considering how difficult it can be to change legal documents.\n\nThis relates to me and my community because my generation will be getting married in the next 15 years.

Whereas 30% of Hispanics took the lead when it came to keeping their last name compared to black brides and white brides who had a lower percentage. While brides who Hyphenated were very minimal, black brides hyphenated more with 16% compared to White and Hispanic brides.\n2. How do the beliefs of today's generation compare to the beliefs of past generations when it comes to brides changing their last names? Are there any other aspects of marriage that are evolving?\n3. Being in a community that consists of many Hispanics, it could be that the possibility of Hispanic brides and those of any race could be more heavily influenced into keeping their last names, which could become a common choice compared to following tradition.\n4.

White brides tend to do this the most, and Hispanic brides tend to do this the least. However, a significant amount of Hispanic brides do keep their own last names.\n\n2. I wonder what may be the reason for so many Hispanic brides to keep their own last names, whether it be a cultural reason or something else. And I also wonder why Black women tend to hyphenate their names more than any other race.\n\n3. This graph is especially interesting to me because my mother is White and my father is Asian, yet my mother didn't take my dad's last name or even hyphenate it. While my mother kept her last name, my last name was the one that got hyphenated. My last name consists of my father's last name and then it's hyphenated to my mother's last name. So I don't even have the same last name as either of my parents, instead I have a union of them. \n\n4. If I were to retitle this graph, I would title it \"What do brides do with their last names?\"",

It's a bit unrelated, but I think that it'd be interesting to see how religion influences marriage choices. Would one religion not care as much as another?",
