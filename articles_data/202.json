What's more, the population of teenagers aged from 16 to 19 did not change a lot since 2000.\n     I am curious about why the population of teenagers is stable. As I know, the population of the world are getting higher, and many scientists are afraid that the earth may not support so many people. Therefore, I guess what the graph indicate is not the world, instead, it is about a certain region.\n     I think the rate of fast-food restaurant will get higher continually because people love go and eat fast-food nowadays. Furthermore, I wish the rate of teenagers in labor forced will get lower. I think teenagers should have the chance to study in school, not working in factories.",

Secondly, the population of teenagers from 16 to 19 went up first but keep smooth after 2000. At last, its teenagers and the labor forced employed both slid down after the year 2000 with similar kinds of shape.\n  There are two points that aroused my curiosity. That is, the relationship between teenagers and the labor forced employed since their movement nearly share the same shape. Also, the relationship between the above two categories and fast-food restaurant because they had shown totally opposite directions after year 2000.\n  In my opinion, I guess the graph is showing people as our life becomes more wealthy (the growing of fast-food consumption), the less people wants to give birth to babies and the less people want to find jobs. As a result, the rate od teenagers and labor forced employed had dropped. All in all, I would like to name this graph \u201cThe impact of modern society improvement on younger generations \u201c.",

I wonder why the teenagers in the labor force and those who are employed decreased so sharply between 2000 and 2010. I also wonder why the teenage population has gone up since 2000 while the overall fertility rate has been rapidly decreasing for many decades. This graph could be captioned with a headline: Fast Food Restaurants Hire Fewer Teens than in 2000. This claim can be supported by the fact that the number of fast food restaurants has increased while the teenagers employed (largely at fast food restaurants) have decreased, indicating teenagers are not being hired as frequently or there are fewer jobs available per fast food restaurant. \n\nFrom this graph, it's possible to infer that it is increasingly difficult to get a job as a teenager nowadays since so many adults without college degrees can no longer be as successful as in, say, the 1970s-80s-90s, and are forced to settle for low-paying jobs that do not require a college diploma, thus decreasing the space for teenagers in the fast-food work place, where the vast majority of employed teenagers are eligible to work. This sharp split could also be because teenagers have become less reliable on jobs or have become less interested in them, which seems unlikely that such a drastic shift could happen over just a few decades, but, it's possible.",

Clearly, there needs to be a workforce to meet the demands of a rapidly-expanding fast food market, such as maintaining the restaurants, which are now relying on more adults than in the past. As shown by the graph, the number of teenagers who are currently in the labor force and/or employed has decreased exponentially since 2000, quite possibly due to the boom of technology. Because of this, teenagers have lost interest in their past societal roles as those working minimum wage jobs and have instead chased other ambitions, such as creating successful apps and searching for higher-paying jobs. As our country came out of the recession in the past few years, more job opportunities have opened up, creating a more competitive job market. In turn, this means that wages are competitively increasing and giving teens more, and more higher-paying, job opportunities. Because of the factors mentioned above, less teens are seeking minimum wage jobs, meaning that adults will have to take their places in the fast food industry.\n - A possible title for this graph could be \"More Calories, Less Interest\"",

Does it mean the number of people at the age 16-19 or something else? It needs to be a little more specific. What caught my eye was how the number of fast food restaurants grew very fast in recent years and the amount of people in the labor force has decreased a lot in recent years. This may be because so many people are getting jobs at the fast food restaurants causing the total amount of people looking for jobs to go down. going back to the graph I noticed about the graph is that on the red line it lists fast food restaurants but it doesn't list what is increasing in fast food restaurants and with the population that is listed, \"what is the population?\", where is this data taken from?

Almost at the same time, the teenagers being employed and in the labor force decreased dramatically until it reached about -30% by 2015. A possible explanation for this is that with more advocates for health, teenagers especially can't see themselves working at a fast-food restaurant which is one of the most common arguments for health.

During this span of time, however, the population of people in the United States that are between 16 and 19 years old has stayed pretty similar, which poses some concerns as we can begin to realize why child obesity is becoming a major problem in the United States: kids are not wanting to work and they are eating these fast foods all the time, causing problems in the country. \n\nI wonder why this has been the trend over the recent years as opposed to back in, say, the 1980s or 1990s.  Back in the 1980s and 90s, obesity was not nearly the problem that is now amongst kids, which makes some sense but not much since these fast food chains existed back during this time as well.  I would think that this can be attributed to the technology that is readily available to kids as well as the fast food being more advertised when children are watching tv. \n\nI think the graph is telling us\u2014not directly\u2014that this is becoming a problem in America that teenagers do not want to work and that they are instead taking a lazy route and not wanting to do anything other than sit around and play on their phones and technology. \n\nI would call this graph, \"Work is Overrated\"",

The population of teenagers aged 16-19 has increased as well, though much less steadily than the number of fast food restaurants. The number of teenagers in the labor force and the number of teenagers employed have both dropped significantly since 2000. I also notice that until the year 2000, all of the measured numbers/percentages were increasing at somewhat similar rates.\nWonder: I wonder why there seems to be an association between the expansion of the fast-food industry and the number of teenagers in the workforce. This contradicts what I would expect (that the creation of more restaurants would increase the number of jobs and therefore the number of teens in the workforce).\nThink: I think that the association could represent a number of things. For example, the decline in teenage employment as compared to the increase in fast-food restaurants may be a sign that teenagers are dissatisfied with fast-food jobs and searching elsewhere for jobs instead, or simply that fewer teenagers are seeking employment nowadays.\nPossible headline: Teenage Employment in Fast Food Restaurants Isn't What You Would Expect",

This could be due to the fact that teenagers feel more pressure to preform well in school, which ends up taking up a lot of their time. Also major developments in technology and social media has made being lazy more of an option.\nI personally work for a fast food chain, and I know a number of teenagers who do too, but I also work with a lot of older people surprisingly. I know for a fact that some of the people I work with retired from their old jobs and are just continuing to work to make more money so this could also be contributing to this data.\nOne question I have about this graph is the fact that the percentages for teenage labor and fast food chains are so close together for a number of years, until about 2000, when the number of fast food chains drastically increases and the number of employed teenagers drastically decreases. Why such an insane change seemingly all of the sudden?\nAdditionally, I have no idea how the people who made this graph are choosing to define the \"labor force\" - I just don't see the difference between the employed line and the labor force line for teenagers.",

I wonder why there is a slight increase in the employment in the year 2010 and if this has anything to do with the economic crash around the year 2008. I also am curious about the differing line colors and what they might mean.

    "comment info": "\"Rise in Kidnappings, Teenage Employment Plummets\"\n\nThere has been a decline in the teenage labour force. From 2000 the teenage population has risen indicating that they're all alive, but teenage employment has declined. This leads us to ask where are the teenagers going? The only logical conclusion is that there has been a rise in kidnapping leading to teenage employment plummeting. The rise in fast food restaurants makes me wonder where are they getting the food? Are you sure your Big Mac isn't a Big Timmy. Obviously teenagers are being used as cattle to supply Mcdonalds and others over zealous need for meat.",

Also, the amount of teenagers in the work force has dramatically decreased since the 2000s. I wonder if this is because of the outgrowing number of new technology being created, or are their parents providing more for them. There is a theory that most teenagers work at fast food restaurants so I find it interesting that the number is gradually decreasing. I also wonder where they have gotten the survey number of teenagers from. I know a lot of teenagers around my area that are employed, as well as myself. I feel as if that teenagers now are more inclined to have a job because of the fact that their parents cannot provide literally everything for them as they grow up. I think getting a job shows responsibility and a lot of teenagers enjoy the freedom of being able to work and have their own money to pay for things rather than rely on their parents.

However, a lot of fast food restaurants hire teenagers, so I believe that the amount of teenagers employed may start to increase, since many of them may become employed by fast food places. This may not be the case, however, due to the fact that teenagers have been taking on more school work and extra curricular activities every year, which means that often times teenagers do not have the time for a job.

I think that if this statement were true, then the lines representing the teenage workforce would follow or mimic the fast food restaurant line.

I notice that around 1998 that numbers have a 0% rate of change, meeting at the x-axis. From there, the number of fast food restaurants continues to increase at a greater rate. The population of 16-19 year olds continues to increase at a relatively steady rate (around 5%). The number of teenagers in the labor force continues to decrease at higher and higher rates. \n\nOne thing that isn't \"misleading\" but made this graph a little bit more difficult to interpret is that the Y-axis is rate of change, not #. The Y-axis and X-axis could both be a little bit more clearly labeled to make this graph a bit more easy to interpret. \n\nThe meaning of the different colored lines could also be a bit more clearly labeled.",

There are slightly more teenagers now, and more fast food restaurants, which means more teen job opportunities, but teen unemployment is still down almost 30% from 2000. There are almost no teens looking for a job that don't have one, since teen labor force and unemployment are near the same today. This clearly shows that even though the jobs are out there, today's teens are just too lazy to look for work.",

    "comment info": "Welcome to \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On in This Graph?\u201d and the Wednesday moderation.  Today\u2019s graph focuses on fast-food restaurants and teenage employment.  A 2012 survey found that over one-third of American children and teenagers consumed fast food on a given day and this constituted about 12% of their daily calories.  Study the graph and, from 9 am \u2013 2 pm E.T. today, give us your responses online to these three questions. (On Thursday afternoon, we\u2019ll reveal the article that included this graph and much more.) \n\n\tWhat do you NOTICE in this graph? \n\n\tWhat do you WONDER? What are you curious about?\n\n\tWhat\u2019s GOING ON in this graph?\nWrite a catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea.  If your headline makes a claim, tell us what you noticed that supports your claim.\n\nThe questions are intended to build on one another, so try to answer them in order. Start with \u201cI notice\u201d and then \u201cI wonder,\u201d and end with the headline.\n\nThen, read some responses. Click on \"Reply\" to an interesting response to get a discussion going. Learn different perspectives when you read what other students have to say about your response. \n\nWe look forward to reading your discoveries.",

    "comment info": "We noticed that although there are slightly more teenagers available to work since 2000, they have dropped by about 40% in their employment. We also noticed that the number of fast food restaurants has gone up about 40%. We thought this was interesting since fast food jobs are entry level and usually worked by teens. We wondered who is working those jobs? We thought about the changing workforce and realized that a lot of adults are working in fast food restaurants (people over 50) in part-time positions that used to be filled by students.",

By around the late 2000's, that labor force employed decreased. From 1995 to 2015, Fast- Food restaurants rapidly increased by +40% in population. The teenagers 16-19 years of age increased in employment by only a little bit.\nI wonder why the graph does not explain what the numbers along the y axis mean. I also am curious on why only the +40 has a percent sign and the rest doesn\u2019t. Additionally, I am confused on what the 16 - 19 stands for.
