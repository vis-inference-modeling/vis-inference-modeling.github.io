One thing that stood out about white deaths is that there is a large number of deaths caused by accidents and that isn\u2019t even a category for black people. I wonder why there was such a large gap between deaths white people and black people in the area of heart disease and cancer and how much institutional racism plays a part in it?

Furthermore, we observed that Black deaths are mostly caused by heart disease and cancer, while white deaths are mostly caused by lung disease and a mix of other health complications. As a result of these findings, we wondered why the black death rate is so much higher in heart disease, cancer, diabetes, strokes, homicide as well as why are there more white deaths for lung disease. Could this have a correlation with the amount of whites that smoke compared to blacks? Based on these questions, we wonder if a lack of access to healthcare with a certain race may be the cause of the differences in death rates. The information presented in this graph shows the important health complications we believe doctors and scientists should be working on more based on race. We think this graph shows how some people are more likely to die from certain causes because of their race and we believe the impact of this information on our community can shed some light onto solutions for the problems this graph might represent.\nHeadline: If we were to choose a headline for this graph, it would be \u201cThe Divides in Death\u201d or \u201cThe Deathly Divide.\u201d",

Here\u2019s some statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Covid-19 hospitalization and death by race/ethnicity (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html).  \n\nWhat is the gap between white and Black people\u2019s death from Covid?",

    "comment info": "I notice that this graph shows major causes of deaths in the United States, and how these causes of death relate to race (Black people and white people specifically). Black people have significantly higher death rates from heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, and several other causes of death than white people. White people seem to have slightly higher death rates for a few causes of death (lung disease, suicude, accidents, and Alzheimer\u2019s). I wonder if Black people have higher rates of disease due to the racism embedded into America\u2019s food systems. In my home city of Memphis, for example, majority Black neighborhoods are kept from accessing healthy foods and all of the grocery stores are located in majority white neighborhoods. Without access to proper nutrition, people can fall victim to a slew of diseases.\n\nThis impacts my community heavily because I live in an extremely diverse yet segregated city where white people are provided with more resources on average than Black people. This graph fuels my anger towards this unfair system by demonstrating how this inequality affects health and can end lives prematurely. \n\nHeadline: Inequality in Life, Inequality in Death.",

Are the causes based on systemic issues (as the article expresses), genetics, environmental conditions or personal behavior?  By Friday, we will reveal the link to the article that included this graph and other graphs.  What risk factors does it advance?  \n\nAlso, read some of the comments made by New York Times readers, especially the Reader and NYT Picks.  What do others believe the reasons for this gap?",
