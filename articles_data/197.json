Additionally, as women gain more independence and freedom, they may decide to put college or their career over having a child at a young age, further pushing back the age of  first-time motherhood. Finally, as the cost of college and living has increased since 1980, young women in 2016 face more economic burdens than those in 1980, and aren't financially able to afford a child due to debt from student loans and overall have less money.",

Technology and medicine are increasingly intertwined as time goes on and there are many more alternate ways to have a child now than there were in 1980. Another important point is that many more women in this current time period attend college and spend most of their 20's trying to become stable in a career path than in the 1980's. College is a big expense and one that can not be payed off while simultaneously paying to raise a child. It is unrealistic to expect to be able to pay off college loans and have a child at the same time, because both are very costly. Something else that could be a reason for first time mothers becoming older is the fact that birth control and emergency contraceptives have become more accessible to women. 1980 is not many years after Roe v. Wade, so the concept of abortions and birth control was new, unknown, and not very accessible.",

I wonder what the different colors mean and what caused this difference in age of first time mothers in the last 36 years.

The y-axis is the percentage of first-time mothers in each one-year interval.  For, example, in 1980, 4% of all first-time mothers were 16 years old.  \nYou may be asking why the maximum percentage is 8% for both the 1980 and 2016 graphs?  It makes it easier to compare graphs when they have the same axes  --  the same minimum, maximum, and interval widths for each of the axes.  Since the 1980 frequencies exceed 8%, the graph designers could have used 10% for both graphs, but maybe they had other reasons to use only 8%.",

I noticed the 1980 graph peaks at 19, while the 2016 graph has a rather flat \"plateau\" between the ages of 19 and 31. I also noticed that first-time mothers at any age make up less than 6 percent in 2016, but in 1980, women between 18 and 20 made up about 24 percent of all first-time mothers. I wonder if there is a correlation between more women in the workforce and overall increase in age of first-time mothers?\n\nA good headline for this would be \"First-time Mothers Getting Older in the New Millennium\"",

I definitely think birth control is part of the change in distribution, however, I also think part of this shift comes from an increased participation of women in the workforce and financial independence as you mentioned in your response. The 1980s still had a lot of \"housewife\" standards for women, and women continued to break out of the domestic sphere over the following 30 years. I think this increased participation in the workforce is what allowed women to live more independently, which is why the overal age of first time mothers has gone up, and why the overall birth rate has gone down.",
