To begin, leisure time is the most time consuming activity, where people have a lot of free time. People, like myself, most likely spend nearly 80% of their time on their devices, which relates to this graph. In this era, people will be on their iPhones for entertainment rather than going on to their computer to watch something, with the rise of short-form content such as Tiktok and Instagram Reels. Also, with the transition from in person to remote work, especially after COVID, not only have people working at their homes risen in my community but also students doing remote school like myself during this time has risen, which relates to the graphs increase of time spent working at home. \n    \n    Create a catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea. - \u201cHome Sweet Home: The Rise of At-Home Activities\u201d",

Something I wondered about was why work was so low since there was a huge surplus of people working from home during covid, so I feel like that number should have been higher.

This is the largest increase in any activity on the graph. I also noticed that all of the activities listed have seen growth over time. Leisure not on a computer has the highest percentage overall, reaching about 85% in 2022. That surprised me, especially considering how much technology, like computers and other devices, dominates our lives now. With COVID-19, people across the U.S. and the world spent more time at home, adjusting to a new way of life, which might explain why all these activities saw a rise in at-home participation.\n    It makes me wonder how this graph might have looked if the pandemic had never happened. Would we still see the same trends, or would some of these activities have remained stable or even decreased? Another question I have is what specifically caused religion and spirituality to grow so much between 2003 and 2022. Was it people searching for comfort during difficult times like the pandemic, or are there other cultural or societal shifts at play?\n    For my community, it was a similar story. Being at home so much brought changes to how we spent our time and connected with others, which made these shifts in behavior very systemic. \n    \n    New Title: The changing ways Americans spend their time at home.",

This is the largest increase in at-home activity participation seen on the graph.  I also noticed that all of the activities on the graph have increased.  I noticed that leisure (not on computer) has the highest percentage, at around 85% in 2022.  This surprises me because of the use of technology today, especially computers and other electronics.  Because of COVID-19, American adults as well as people all over the world began to spend more time at home, adjusting to a new lifestyle.  This could be the reason why all of these activities have had increased percentages of engagement at home for American adults.  I wonder if this graph would look different if the pandemic had never happened.  I also wonder why exactly religion and spirituality have increased significantly from 2003-2022.  This relates to me and my community because during the pandemic, I participated in all of these activities at home.  Personally, I participated in these activities at home more during the pandemic than ever before in my life.  \n    Headline: America's Favorite at Home Activities",

All at-home activities increased during this time period. This means that people are spending less time doing activities outside of their homes. For example, religion and spirituality became much more home-centered. This means that many people decide to stay home and practice their religions instead of going out to church. The decline of leaving the home to participate in activities could decrease socialization and community in the population.

Also, religion and spirituality have grown from 20% to around 60%, which is the biggest growth demonstrated on this chart. I also noticed that there are a couple of activities listed in the description not on the graph like sleeping and shopping, that align with the hobbies of ages 15-18(the sample was ages 15 and over). My biggest curiosity about this graph is if the recent COVID-19 lockdown contributed to the rise in some of the activities done at home like work and education. I also wonder how much these activities rose each year so then it might be easier to theorize on what caused spikes. For example, is the introduction of new and better technology a reason why some of these things are done at home?  This impacts me and my community because I have grown up ina. time period where technology is a huge part of our daily life and makes it so more things can be done at home.

Finally, I noted that under the graph it says that these responses were gathered via telephone survey.\n    2) In my prior sentence, I learned that the survey was conducted through the phone. I wonder if this method would alter the responses as older people are more likely to pick up the phone than younger, effecting the 15 and over range. I also wonder why they chose to include these 6 activities specifically. Finally, I wonder how these responses would change in 2024-2025. \n    3) This relates to me and my community during the pandemic everyone had to learn how to adapt and adjust their life to be at home. Schools went virtual, sports were done through zoom, and people had to depend on making their own food rather than going out. I think that a lot of those habits, that we picked up through the pandemic, have stuck with us whether it is good or bad. \n    4) An American's Time at Home: What Can't You Do?",

Notably, there has been a surprising and significant rise in time dedicated to religion and spirituality. Interestingly, while work and education have also seen increases, leisure time has paradoxically grown as well.\n    2. The significant increase in religion and spirituality raises questions about the factors driving this trend, especially in light of the recent growth of atheism. Additionally, I wonder about the criteria used to define religious or spiritual activities performed at home.\n    3.

I also noticed that religion and spirituality has significantly increased since 2003. Additionally, all home activities have increased to some extent. I wonder where spending time on electronic devices would fit on this graph, and if it would be the most drastic increase. I also wonder how this data would look on another graph, such as s line graph, to show how activities have increased or decreased throughout the years. Is religious practices in the home a recent development or has it been steadily increasing since 2003? I also wonder if this has to do with quarantine. This relates to me and my community because it seems as though people are spending increasing amounts of time at home, and that could affect how I and others socialize.

The percentage of time spent on specific activities at home has increased while other activities have decreased. This might suggest a trend towards more home-based activities, possibly influenced by technology and recent global events. What factors have contributed to these changes in time allocation? How much has remote work, streaming services, or the pandemic influenced people\u2019s choices and lifestyles? Are there age groups or demographics that are more affected by these shifts? This relates to my community because we see an increase in home activities, like remote work and online jobs.

People mostly spend leisure time at home and this has had a small increase, but has always been high. The graph is based on adults people ages 15 or older.

I was surprised by this and would have expected a much larger jump, given we had the pandemic, which changed the dynamic of the workplace for many companies.\n    2. I really wonder what it was that caused the practice of religion and spirituality at home to spike so much during this time period.

The year ranges are completely different which can provide differing results because of different trends, new technology, etc. I noticed that leisure was already at a high percentage in 2003 and continued to increase in 2022. This surprised me because I would have assumed that people would mainly be spending their time on their phones, computers, etc. instead of doing things outside of technology. I also saw how religion and spirituality skyrocketed. This may be because of world events and pandemics that cause people to be more in tune with religion and develop their faith. I wonder why work is at a low percentage for 2022 because, after the 2020 pandemic, many people were still working from home during this time.

    "comment info": "1) Observations - This graph shows the change in the percentage of time certain activities were done at home rather than outside from 2003 to 2022. Out of all the activities, religion & spirituality increased the most, with a 40% increase, meaning that on average, the Americans from the survey partook in religious/spiritual activities at home 60% of the time by 2022. Sports & Exercise, leisure time, eating & drinking had minor increases, while work & education had moderate increases. \n    \n    2) Questions - I wonder why religious and spirituality activities show very high increases, and why sports, exercise, and leisure time only show minor increases. How does the increase of religious and spiritual practices at home impact traditional places of worship (i.e, church) or community gatherings? Could the increase in at-home activities contribute to loneliness and social isolation? Can we associate this with mental illness trends? \n    \n    3) Relation to Community - Perhaps the significant increase in religious & spiritual practices at home could reflect how local religious communities have begun to use virtual services, signaling a change in how the people of NJ approach their faith. Additionally, if more people continued to move towards remote work & education, this could potentially decrease the demand for transportation.\n    \n    4) Headline - America Indoors: A Glimpse Into the Two-Decade Shift Toward Home-Centered Living!",

I wonder if certain activities became more popular due to COVID. \n    This relates to me and my community because a lot of these activities are done in my home and my general community. I know lots of parents now just work from home due to the covid effect, so this could match up with the increase in the \"work\" percentage from 2003 to 2022. \n    Catchy headline: Popular at home activities over the years: what was the effect?",

I noticed that the circle section of the arrows look to represent the percentages from 2003 and the end of the arrow represents the percentage from 2022. Along with that, I couldn't help but notice the growth in the percentage of religion and spirituality. This was the sole activity that had the largest growth from 2003 to 2022. \n    \n    2. What do you wonder? To add on the idea of religion and spirituality having the largest growth over the period of time, I wonder what events in this period of time caused that growth to occur. Part of me feels that it would be technology and COVID-19 related. \n    \n    3. How does it relate to you or your community? This graph caused me to reflect on my personal daily activities. I noticed that as a high school student, my graph would have a higher percentage of time spent on Education, Eating and Drinking, and Work. It is interesting to me though that I feel my community around me would fit this graph, especially the religious aspect. I have noticed recently that people within my community have become more religious. \n    \n    4.

Also I think things like education and working at home have increased since Covid-19. \n    2. I wonder where in America did most of this data come from? Since only 55% of the data collected was used, one region is more prevalent within the data than others. Also how old are the people that are giving the data? Because in 2022 many young people don't answer random calls but older people usually do so who is most of the results coming from?\n    3.
