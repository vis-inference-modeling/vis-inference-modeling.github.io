There has been a drastic change from the meghalayan age to Anthropocene compared to the  gap before between Holocene. The gap of 4 million people to 27 million is not nearly as drastic as the spike up to 2.5 billion. There is a bunch of underlying factors to this and one of the most major reasons is modern medicine. We hav managed to find ways to expand our lifespan and thus, more and more people are  still here to stay. This affects me and my community because yes human life is a beautiful thing, we are becoming drastically overpopulated.

In America, the population is constantly growing due to immigration and economic growth.  11,700 years ago giving birth wasn't that safe children were expected to die. Now there are so many resources.\n2. I wonder if this growth in population affected the economic status of America. Did this cause a surplus of resources? I'm just saying because China for some time had a one-baby law due to a lack of resources. \n3. As much as America strives for separation of Church and State. However Christian views do take over and Christian views are to have as many babies as possible, catholicism goes as far as to ban the use of birth control.

Overpopulation leads to negative environmental effects and people need space to live. This means more waste, worse air quality, less water quality. Everything can be effected by the overpopulation.

The main thing I notice is how the population remains relatively similar until is really spikes around 70 years ago.  Until this point, the population remained in the millions.  However, around 70 years ago, people truly settled down in neighborhoods and medical care most likely improved so people could live longer.  70 Years ago would place us in the 1950s which was right after World War 2 during the generation of the baby boomers.

While it doesn't seem small, everyday more people are moving in, causing our population rates to expand. There is not enough room to shelter or contain these people in schools or apartments, which are causing officials to have to build more.

I also observed that the population grew by 5.2 billion people in 70 years, which is the greatest quantity of growth. Most years transpired between the Holocene and Meghalayan ages, but there was little to no population growth evident.\n\n2) Is medical progress producing an imbalance in births and deaths, addressing one issue (illness) while creating another (overpopulation)? I'm curious how medical therapies have developed in tandem with population growth. Is the evolution of the human species inextricably linked with population growth, as we are able to handle complicated issues that earlier resulted in shorter life spans?\n\n3) The recent increase in human population has a number of effects on the Earth system, including economic growth, a lack of employment, a lack of housing, infrastructure, pollution that leads to poor living conditions, and greater extraction of resources from the ecosystem. These goods include minerals, trees, water, and creatures, especially those found in the oceans. Depletion of resources causes environmental degradation, strife, and an increased chance of pandemics, placing the world at risk.\n\n4) Human Population Aging through the Ages",

Most years passed between the Holocene and Meghalayan eras, however there was a lesser rate of population growth.\n2.

This graph does bring up a question, however, that being how long this seemingly vertical increase in population can continue. As overpopulation becomes more apparent, what issues could arise from this exponential growth? This could affect every community, as more people can result in larger and more dense population centers, a decrease in quality of life in third-world countries, as they can't keep up with the growing population, and an increase in the rate of global warming, as more people will output more emissions in the air.
