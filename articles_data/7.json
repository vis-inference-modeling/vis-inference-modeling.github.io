This relates to me because when we were moving we saw a house with a rail road behind it, and the noise coming from that would be simalar to the noise from the rocket because the sound is amplified by the closer distance.",

    "comment info": "In this graph I notice many details such as launch noise, amount of pressure, and measurements which showcase the Triple Boom idea from SpaceX. I know from previous information that SpaceX is owned by Elon Musk and is a space exploration company. The Triple Boom is the action and plan that is taken when bringing the rocket back to earth. I see that the red color means high pressure and the blue means low pressure. In the picture high pressure is used at the bottom of the rocket's parts. For instance at the bottom of the fins it is bright red, and by the engines it is bright red. I wonder if this is just an idea/plan, or if it has been done before after going up into space. I also find it interesting how something so complicated is able to be perceived easily. I wonder if it is really hard to put what is going on here in simpler words like it is done in the graph. This relates to me and my community because the government had cut out a lot of NASA funding which meant that space exploration was declining. However Elon Musk is using his money to help find data and new findings in space. It also relates to me because I am living during new space exploration.

These pressure differences appear to come from the rocket\u2019s movement through the atmosphere at speeds faster than sound. There are also labels like \"Trailing Edge ... BOOM\" and \"Pressure Change ... BUH,\" which suggest specific points where sound waves (or sonic booms) are produced.\n    2. What do you wonder?\n    I wonder how often these sonic booms happen when rockets land and if there are ways to make them quieter. I\u2019m also curious about how scientists can predict or reduce the impact of the pressure changes that cause these loud noises. Do certain weather conditions make the booms louder or quieter?\n    3. How does this relate to you and your community?\n    This relates to me and my community because as space travel becomes more common, rockets like Falcon 9 might land more often, even near where people live.

If this low pressure air gets in the engine, it creates uneven tension on the turbofan, leading to accelerated engine wear. However, this gap increases the radar cross section of the plane.

There is a wide area of intense high pressure just below the engine of the rocket, and another, yet smaller pocket of intense high pressure below the fins. It quickly becomes much milder in just a few feet if you stray from the curve of intensity. There is a thin portion of low pressure between the mild high pressure at the legs and fins, and a larger area of low pressure behind the entire rocket. There is a sonic boom behind each low-pressure area and in front of each high-pressure area. The sonic boom occurs approximately 8 minutes after launch. I wonder what rocket has achieved the most sonic booms. There are no rockets launched in rural Michigan, but our county airport does have planes that take off, and they make a loud noise as they fly overhead.
