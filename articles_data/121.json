It can cause a lot of problems and it can cause peoples lives at risk. Not getting the vaccine can lead to more people not being protected and causing the virus to spread easier making it harder for us to recover.\n\nHeadline: Major barriers for the vaccine in many states cause people's lives and others to be on the line.",

The smaller fingerprints tend to belong more to the northern states, along with the overall lower level of concern. Going more in depth, the green states(low concern) have a relatively small fingerprint, but a few of the states have spikes in specific variables. The pink states(high concern) have a more circular and well-rounded shape, with equal data in almost every variable for most of its states.\n\nWonder:\nThe map shows us a distinctly split status of the states- northern states having less concern in vaccination, while southern states are struggling with a much higher concern. I wonder if this has to do with economic statuses, or bigger populations all in all. Are there too many people to have proper healthcare, or is it a matter of social behavior?\n\nImpact to community:\nFrom the data, Virginia is shown to have a typically less-concerning vaccination barrier issue, but has a big spike for the variable \"Low Health Care\". Other than this, Virginia seems to be on a good path to vaccination, with less overall barriers in the process. In a nation-wide mindset, southern states are struggling to get vaccinated- it will be harder in the big picture to go back to \"normal\", and to maintain a decreasing case count.\n\nHeadline:\n \"Vaccination Barriers- A Roadblock to Normality\".",

I also noticed that some states have more vaccination barriers than all other states including Nevada, Mississippi, Georgia, and Oklahoma. The high amounts of vaccination barriers could be due to the lack of architecture in the southern states. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder if other factors such as skepticism, amount of education, ethnicity, religion, etc. also contribute to the amount of vaccination barriers and if so, by how much. I also wonder why Indiana has such a high level of concern despite being in the northern part of the United States. \n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis graph impacts me and my community because although we want to reduce the amount of COVID-19 cases by getting everyone vaccinated, some states are limited by their own community.

In rural states such as Texas and Arkansas, there are high levels of concern for many vaccination barriers such as irregular medical, poor health care access, and low health care resources. This is possibly due to a less dense population in certain regions, making it more difficult for residents to find clinics that offer abundant vaccines in a safe manner. On the other hand, urban states have minimal concerns regarding the vaccination barriers except for low health care resources. Seeing the spike in concern over that issue, I wondered if this was due to a denser population that required more health care resources at a faster rate. \n\nWhat impact does this have on you or your community?\nAccording to the graph, New York's biggest concern on barriers is the socioeconomic barrier. In the region of New York where I live, this isn't as big of an issue as other places in New York such as New York City and lower-income neighborhoods.

The impact that this graph has on me and my community are it keeps us informed about the situation that is happening in other nearby states.

I have come to find that the state of Massachusetts has fewer cases of COVID and we are in a low range of coronavirus vaccination barriers. I understand that other states may not be so lucky because they have lower health care, poor health care access, irregular medical care, and historic under vaccination.

I can see that many states in the south are purple, meaning they are high risk, and tend to have the most barriers to the Covid-19 vaccine. Many of those states suffer from socioeconomic barriers, low health care, poor health access, and irregular medical care. I can also see that many states in the north also struggle with socioeconomic barriers primarily, but they are marked blue for low risk areas. I wonder as to why it is that we see much more concern and lack of medical care in the south than we do in the north. My first guess would be that the Northeast specifically has always excelled in medical advancements and medical care -- so it makes sense that they are doing well distributing coronavirus vaccines. My second guess is that the southern states tend to be very Republican leaning, and many people who are Republican are hesitant towards getting the vaccine. It could very much be that they are unsure and a little nervous to get it. It could also just be the socioeconomic background because I do know that the southern communities are very remote and struggle financially.

Which leads to the question what are some states doing differently than others to have such an unbalanced concern level spread across all states in the United States? Though New York has a low concern, and New York city is a hotspot for tourist to come, it is a bit unnerving knowing that people who are in the higher concerned area would visit knowing that they are unvaccinated, risking New York to become exposed again. Therefore an alternative headline for this graph would be \"Coronavirus Concern level\".

Most of the states that we may call \"southern\" states have an overall rounder and fuller circle as compared to many northern states. Most of the problems and barriers in the southern states seem to be irregular medical care, socioeconomic barriers, and low health care resources while the degree of problems seems to vary in the many northern states with a less \"fuller\" circle. I do certainly wonder why speecific barriers are more prominent in the South as compared to the North and why they are not being adequately addressed.\n\nThis data indicates that all of these barriers already pose a significant obstacle for efficient and rapid vaccinations. The data also demonstrates how certain communities, counties, and states may have to gear more of their focus on one specific barrier as compared to a measure that would moderate all of the barriers. Such a solution focusing on one barrier will also be more effective as compared to \"dipping a hand in everything.\"\n\nThe graphs clearly indicate that the southern states have a higher degree of barriers to vaccinations as compared to northern states.

I also notice that the higher portion of states in the United States such as South Dakota, Wisconsin, and more, all have low levels of concern. I wonder why all the southern states have a high level of concern. This significantly impacts my community because it exemplifies that my community is not at the same risk as other communities in the United States that are part of states which have high levels of concern. Within these graphs, barriers regarding coronavirus vaccination are illustrated by the utilization of shapes in colors which signify the extent of concern for each state with purple meaning \u2018high\u2019 and green meaning \u2018low\u2019.

This is in contrast to the northeastern states that have a lower level of concern almost across the board. One state that really shocked me was California because I was very surprised to find out that they met the criteria for historic under vaccination. California has quite a large population of people, so I wonder why they have a history of under vaccination?\n2) This graph does raise many concerns for me and our community. It is quite upsetting that New York does meet the criteria for socioeconomic barriers.

I wonder why they can't access the COVID vaccine as well as northeastern states, like New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. However, this isn't a surprise to me southern states historically have worse access to health care. The population is scarcer, as most of the \"overall concern\" states do not have a major city within them. Yes, every state has at least one city, but it doesn't make those cities automatically comparable to states with cities like Boston or New York City. These cities bring wealth into a state, that would be impossible for say, Oklahoma to have. This obviously negatively impacts the \"overall concern\" states because they don't have enough good access to care.   \nA good title for this graph would be is, \"Why do scarcely populated states receive less COVID vaccination care?\"",

When first observing the following graphic, there is a trend of Southern states facing greater vaccination barriers, all of which are rooted in health care problems or generalized poverty. Another trend that was noticeable in the graph is the lack of distinction between rural and urban. Personally, I would like to know the environment in which these problems are present. For example, is a metropolis not compensating for the oversaturated urban areas or are rural areas not reaching their full vaccination? Furthermore, how are limitations assessed in the data set used? Research limitations in fields of epidemiology dealing with such an evolving pandemic like COVID could exist. Was the following data based on expert assumptions, social based questionnaires that have margin errors for bias? Could there be other factors not represented by the following infographic like inefficient systems of administration blocking citizens from getting their vaccines? \n2). NY is a heavily populated state so it can be assumed that the waves of vaccination might take a bit longer. However, from family and friends, I've heard various situations with regards to the barriers being presented. Some do feel that communication was sparse while others got the vaccine with ease. Thus, the sections in this infographic do not pertain to what I personally heard and reflects one of the limitations I had listed above.

Is this tied to liberal vs conservative health policies in each state?\nLiving in Oregon, it looks like our heaviest barriers are low health care resources, historic undervaccination, and irregular medical care. Knowing many people who cannot afford health care or doctors visits, this makes sense to me. I am worried for our community, especially our high houseless population, who are more at risk due to the inability to use healthcare resources.

Meanwhile with the upper states, they have medium concern because  of the need of distributing the vaccine faster.\n\n-I wonder how would each state slowly resolve the issue and the level of concern at hand instead of focusing on on how the numbers are high  with the cases in each state. would that change the level of concern of each state didn't focus on the number of cases their state has? \n\n- I would say I'm neutral with the affect of the vaccine because at the end of the day i New York people are waiting until they receive the shot in regards to social distancing and the air at hand.I feel like New York has a lot of cases because the air pollution helped the corona virus to speed more.\n\n- my catchy headline \" concern based on getting vaccines\"",

The shapes within the circles display different barriers within the states that limit corona virus vaccinations from happening. I also noticed that most of the southern states have larger limitations.\nI wonder how the restrictions in these areas can be resolved. I also wonder how the number of cases may affect whether or not people want to get vaccinations. If a state has higher number of cases like NY, do they have more vaccinations available? If so is that why there's a lower level of concern on the map for vaccination barriers?\nThis impacts my community because living in the East coast it seems like most of the states have a low level of concern when it comes to vaccination barriers. Hopefully this means that our communities are able to have immunity because of it soon.\nA headline for this graph could be \"Vaccination Barriers Around the States\"",

    "comment info": "The first thing that I noticed was the juxtaposed sizes between Southern and Northern states. As you pan down, you will notice the color change and size enlargement per each state. Another notable detail is that each state is in its respective shape; however, blown out of scale based on the states' healthcare circumstances. For example, a state swayed to the left represents its irregular medical care, but the sharper right implies socioeconomic barriers, etc. As for the color change, the graph notes that a pinkish color represents a higher amount of vaccination barriers.\n\nFortunately, I live in a Northern state. Therefore, significant vaccination barriers do not affect my community in comparison to any Southern state.  The graph does mark the great socioeconomic barrier within our healthcare system. However, the community I live in tends to represent slightly higher incomes,  given it is just right outside the city. \n\nLastly, from my understanding, the graph represents vaccination restrictions and the suppression within a state's medical system. Additionally, from examining the graph, you would notice drastic changes from Northern vs. Southern states. Specifically, it shows that Southern states most likely seek large amounts of poor health care access and low health care resources. Regarding a title for the graph, I would suggest \"Your States' Noted COVID-19 Vaccination Barriers.\"",

Also, Indiana faces the most barriers of all the midwestern states. Another thing we noticed was that Virginia and Colorado have the best health care out of all the states. Smaller states like Massachusetts have easier access to the vaccine and face fewer barriers to rapid vaccination. Lastly, we noticed that several states have good performance in all of the categories except for low health care resources. We have some questions about the graph like why the southern states that lifted their mask mandate have more trouble getting access to the vaccine. We wonder why states in the midwest and east coast have fewer barriers to vaccination unlike the states in the south. We wonder if factors such as population affect certain states from getting more access to the vaccine. This graph impacts our community because it shows how good the state\u2019s health care systems are and if they are able to distribute the vaccine properly, however since we live in Minnesota, according to the graph we have a great health care system and good access to it. This does not mean it is perfect though, which means there are still people struggling to get the vaccine and find good health care.",

The first thing we found was that the East coast has relatively low concern levels for vaccination barriers. However, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island share similar concerns for social economic barriers. We also noticed that there are more vaccination barriers in the Southern states. Our own state of Minnesota has a relatively low level of concern. We also wondered why there is such a great divide between the North and the South in vaccination barriers? Could this be a result of certain regions being prioritized for vaccination over other states and what impact does that have on vaccination barriers? Access to vaccinations plays a major role in ensuring that the entire community can be healthy and safe amidst this pandemic. In Minnesota, vaccination access is much better than many other states, although the greatest barrier is low health care resources. Depending on which state you live in, this will affect the role the government plays in mandating policies to curb the spread and distribute vaccinations. Lastly, if your state has a low level of concern, restrictions might be limited and the community might open up sooner.

I also wonder why poor health care access will limit the amount of vaccines given as vaccine doses purchased with taxpayer dollars are free, there could just be an administering fee. If we are trying to create a herd immunity, shouldn't places that are low income be offered free vaccines if the actual dosage is free to the person administering it?

We also noticed that the most common barrier to getting the vaccine is historic undervaccination and irregular health care. The states with low barriers to get the vaccine also lean more toward the democratic side of politics. We wonder why there is a difference in the middle of the north and southern states. We wonder if the barriers perhaps mean that the vaccines only happen within the barrier. We also wonder if the population affects what will happen with the vaccinations and barriers in each state, especially in Virginia. The Impact that will be seen through this data is that the states with the lowest level of healthcare barriers will be the first states to reopen safely. Another impact seen will be overall access to healthcare in the coming years. States in the south may struggle to provide quality healthcare due to an overwhelming amount of covid treatment. Where states in the north will be able to focus on providing healthcare to non Covid cases southern states will still be handling Covid patients and ignoring other medical crises. \n\nCatchy Title: The Most Problematic States for COVID- 19 Vaccinations",

Personally, I have not seen any obstacles so far, as both my parents have been vaccinated already without any hassle.\n\n\"What's going on in these graphs?\"-- The graph shows a map of the 50 states with their various types of coronavirus vaccination barriers and their degree of concern. An appropriate, yet catchy title that depicts the main idea of this graph would be \"How concerning are these vaccination barriers in the United States\" or \"What are these sacrilegious vaccination barriers in my state\" or, \"How can fingerprints accurately depict vaccination barriers?\" It truly makes no sense as to why the US is so unequal when it comes to vaccine distribution in a serious pandemic. In my opinion, any legislations that inhibit the proper and effective distribution of vaccines, should be toned down.",

The socioeconomic barriers in New York State seem great, but you don\u2019t see it in your community.  So, where are they?  Go to the article (see link in the release) and you can see the fingerprint for each county.  This will lead you to an understanding of where the socioeconomic barriers are.  How do the socioeconomic barriers affect you even though you do not live in these counties?  Knowing where they are, then come up with some strategies that could reduce them.",

The first of these being, states in the northeastern area of the US have a low level of concern regarding the virus in comparison to those states in the south. The graph shows this using color codes that show a low level of concern being green, a high level of concern being magenta, and anything thing in between being blue, purple, or turquoise. The second thing I noticed was the fact that most northeastern states do not have many barriers preventing vaccination in comparison to the south. With these two observations in mind, I wonder what sectional factors are contributing to this rather drastic difference in vaccine concern and vaccination barriers.\n\nSeeing the information associated with New York, this being that NY is a blue state with few vaccination barriers is very reassuring to me and my community as it means we likely on the right track in terms of our practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, it cannot be denied that there is room for improvement in our practices.\n\nThe graph clearly depicts the obstacles each state faces in regards to vaccinations. A title that could work here is \"What could be holding your state back from rapid vaccination?\". This title manages to summarize what the focus of the graph is, this being the obstacles some states will face that will keep them from being rapidly vaccinated.",

You can go to the online CDC Covid Data Tracker to easily find the up-to-date Covid statistics by state.

I also noticed how the state of Alaska is surrounded by five factors that may contribute to the high level of concern that this state poses in relation to coronavirus vaccination barriers. It seems that Alaska serves as a key to represent the potential factors that may be restricting vaccination in other states, depending upon which angle the color of the state is shaded in, since each angle points toward a different factor. I wonder why northeastern  states depicted on the map seem to have lower concern than southern and western states. \n\nThe graph illustrates that the state I live in (New York) has a low concern for vaccination barriers. Indeed, I have also seen others in my community, such as teachers and health care professionals, go to get vaccinated rather frequently. This supports the idea that New York has a low concern about vaccination barriers.\n\nThe graph depicts the various factors that may contribute to vaccination barriers in each state. As such, a relevant title for this graph may be \"What Barriers are Restricting Rapid Vaccination in Your State?\" because it is both eye-catching and it reveals the purpose of the graph to the reader without them having to try to understand what information is being presented.",

Write a catchy headline.\n*You will not get full credit unless you address all three bullet\nIt is clearly depicted in the graph that the northeastern states such as New York and New Jersey pose less of a risk for having barriers when receiving the covid 19 vaccine compared to southern states. This was clearly shown as the states are laid out in proper geographical location. With the key telling the reader that blue/green states are less of a concern with regards to vaccination. I wonder what legislation was put in place in the southern states that it is making it harder for people to get vaccines.\n\nThe graph has minimal impact on my community as I am from New York. The graph actually shows a positive outlook for the state because vaccines are easier to access in the state. While there have been some difficult hurdles when actually booking an appointment for your vaccine, this is definitely a step in the right direction because it puts us a little closer to getting back to \"normal.\"\n\nThe graph is showing the state breakdown on the ease of receiving a vaccine.

    "comment info": "The first thing that I noticed when looking at this graph was that how drastic the difference in barriers was based on the region. It is clear to see that the region with the greatest amount of barriers is the South and that the region with the least barriers is the Northeast. Based off of these observations, I wonder why the South is in such a worse circumstance in comparison to the rest of the United States. I an also curious as to why Virginia is the only state in the South that does not seem to have an abnormally large amount of barriers before getting the vaccine.\n\nThese restrictions have a fairly major impact on my community. Although I live in New York, which is one of the states with fewer barriers, the issue of getting the vaccine is still very prevalent. These barriers are delaying the vaccines from being distributed which is a very bad thing. Not only does it put more people at risk, but it also prevents the communities from opening back up fully. If these vaccines can be properly distributed, hopefully there will be more leniency with all the strict rules that there are right now due to Covid. For example, maybe schools and sports can go back to being more normal again.\n\nA headline that I would use for this graph is: What Barrier Will You Face For Vaccination. The graph shows the obstacles each state has to face when trying to get the vaccine. Using this information each person can deduce what barrier they will most likely have to face.",

If we have a lot of states having high concerns about the vaccination, they probably will opt not to receive it. this slows down the rate of herd immunity in America and will prolong the coronavirus pandemic.
