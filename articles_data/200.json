Why are the people that could vote in these three categories in particular from democratic states. But my main overall question is why are the republican majority states not voting? They like I said in all five categories have the majority of people not being able to vote from republican states. Right now in our political climate, they are the majority.

    "comment info": "In this graph, I noticed the following:\nIn regards to procrastinating voters, only 33% could vote. In comparison to convicted-felon voters, there is only an 8% increase in states that could vote. Moreover, between no ID and Working parent voters, only 54% and 47% could vote, respectively. While there is a majority of Democrats able to vote in the group of convicted-felon voters, the eager students that are able to vote have a Republican majority. \n\nI wonder why the Republican population has a greater amount of states not voting, especially considering that they are the majority party in the United States. Also, why do two groups have a summation of 51 while the others have a summation of 50? Do some groups consider TheDistrict of Columbia? \n\nI think this graph has a lot to do with the rise of hyperpartisanship, and how a majority of Americans feel reluctant to vote (as a result). I would title this graph: \"Who is participating in our pluralist republic?\" or \"Apolitical strata limits the representation of the whole\".",

If I were the editor, I would have a hard time choosing which to use.\nMany responders wrote about the number of non-voters.  But, I notice that this shows states in which there are non-voters.  Are non-voters and states with non-voters the same?  How are they different?\nYou notice that there is an 8% increase in states voting from Procrastinating Voters to Convicted-Felon Voters.  Talk to your classmates:  What is the difference between \u201c8% increase\u201d and \u201c8% point increase?\u201d\nThere has been another student responder who asked about the 51 state total.  Search for \u201c51\u201d in the responses and see what this students and I said.\nThank you for sharing your noticings and wonderings and those great headlines.",

I wonder if there are other barriers?\nThis infographic shows barriers by state.  What about by population?  What do you think about proportion of  the U. S. population that is affected by a specific barrier?  Or any barrier?  There are 96 barriers from Republican majority and 25 barriers from Democratic majority in their state House of Representatives.  That\u2019s 79% and 21% of the barriers from Republican and from Democratic states, respectively.  Just looking at which states have barriers, do these percentages hold for the total population?  If not, how would they be different?",

Meanwhile, all the states that could not vote for each section were Republican. Also majority of the eager student voters who could vote were from Republican states. It seems that the more educated states (working parent and eager student voters) were Republican states.\nI wonder why for each section, the two numbers add up to 51 states instead of 50. Because there are 50 states in the U.S., so I don't understand why there are 51 states accounted for in this graph. Was D.C. counted as a state?\nA catchy headline for this graph could be \"Republican states vote less\"",
