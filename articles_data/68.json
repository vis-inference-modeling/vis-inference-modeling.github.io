I wonder why this occurs although I do have some suspicions. I believe this occurs in college because when you have more money you have more time to socialize and don\u2019t have to worry about getting a job or working on school as much. I also believe this occurs within neighborhoods because when you\u2019re low income, you are more likely to not have a parent around or thing around you to keep you entertained so you make friends with those around you. This related to my community because a lot of people here come from different socioeconomic backgrounds and I wonder how this will affect us in the years to come.

This could be because they relate to each other being in poverty and bond over their bad situations. My claim is supported by the spike in 5th and 25th income rates in the neighborhood graph. I also notice a lot of middle class people make their friends at work. This could be because they spend more time at work. I notice that wealthy people make most of their friends in college. This is definitely because more wealthy people can afford to go to college than poor people. This could also be because the wealthiest people join frats and sororities, which is pretty much paying for friends. The evidence in the graph is the spike in \"high income\" (75th and 100th percentile) for college students. The final thing I noticed is that the highschool graph is pretty evenly spread out.\n\n2.) I wonder if part of the reason wealthier people make most of their friends at college is because they don't have to worry about academics as much, because if God forbid they fail out then their Mom or Dad will just pay for them to go to another college.\n\n3.)

I wonder why they make more friends in college compared to the other places. Is it because in college people get to hang out with their friends while in high school they're pretty much busy doing actual work. At work people go there to work and earn money for themselves or to provide it to their family. And observe in the neighborhood you just stay home and talk to your friends only when you see them. I also wonder why the number of friends in highschool are so much lower than the other three places? Is it because it falls both in low income and high income people or something else? As far as I know high school is where students make a lot of friends where they hang out and do their things but I\u2019m really concerned why it is so different. This relates to me and my community because it shows what it looks like to live in a community filled with many different people. I also live in a community where both low income and high income people live and I\u2019m not surprised to see the difference. Compared to back then a lot of things have changed. For example, new technology which includes phones, computers and more,  which is why many people would rather stay home rather than go out.

If your notice makes a claim, where in the graph is the evidence to support it?\n\nI notice that people in higher income tiers make more friends in college than people in lower income tiers do. The very high positive correlation in the graph between income level and number of friends from college supports my claim.\n\n\nWhat do you wonder? \n\nI wonder about the causal relationship between income and college friendships. There is a positive correlation between income and education level. Those who attend college tend to earn higher incomes, so as the income level increases, the percentage of individuals who have attended college increases. This logically should result in a higher number of friendships made in college. Also, it is possible that those who are more effective at networking in college are also more likely to utilize those networks to earn more income in their careers. Lastly, those who are born to parents who are college educated are more likely to attend college (often as legacies) and have a head start in both college networking and gaining access to higher income careers. \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\n\nThis dynamic can lead to a divide in opportunities between those who have familial advantages and those who do not in my community.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?

Obviously they made the most friends in college which is where most people make business connections as well as share the same profesional intentions whereas lower income people tend to make more friends with their neighbors. I don't really have an idea of why but my guess is the lower income people feel like they don't need to impress anybody and so they naturally just click with each other and maybe they are more approachable but again I don't really know.",

Additionally, both lower and higher income individuals make friends in high school and at work hence the approximately normal distributed graph.\n\nWhat I wonder is that are the friendships made in high school/at work more genuine and long lasting compared to the one in college or the neighborhood? The graphs show that both high income and low income people mutually made their friends in high school or work while the other two graphs are skewed.\n\nThis relates to my community as a high school student. The graph of people making friends in high school is almost normally distributed, meaning that the students are friends no matter their income. I believe that this is accurate, as me and most of the people I know don\u2019t base friendships on money but more on similar interests on media, sports, hobbies, etc.\n\nAn interesting title for this graph can be \u201cMoney for Companionships\u201d.",

This is supported by a left-skewed graph regarding what people make their friends in college (largely being higher-income individuals) and a right-skewed graph describing what people make their friends in their neighborhood/childhood (lower-income individuals).\n2. I wonder if it is any coincidence at all that higher income individuals are more commonly making their friends in college rather than in their neighborhood like lower-income individuals, or if this parallel could be defined by the disparity of privileges between the two groups, as by and large, those belonging to lower-income communities/tax brackets generally aren\u2019t attending college as frequently and thus have less probability of making friends there. \n3.

In high school and at work the graphs are very similar, looking as if it barley matters what income you have in relation to making friends.

However, it makes me think of how brief high school is and how friends wait in other places.\nI inferred that college friends come from money. If one is barely scraping by and is using in their resources to arrive at the highest potential, they will study and attend classes, focusing. Americans who have enough money will be more likely to attend secondary institutes. No one in college has enough money, but there is an abundance of friends.\nAs far as work friends go, they seem to come from where one falls in the workplace food chain. If you are in manual labor, you won\u2019t be talking to those in ranks above you, and if you are a director or coordinator, you won\u2019t be stopping by everyone\u2019s offices checking in. I can assume that, if the graph went further, the symmetry would not change, rather, it could follow the trend. \nAnd finally, in the neighborhood, those who don\u2019t have much in the material sense have the most in companionship. Those who live so close to each other, are usually roughly in the same boat, and have nothing to prove to those around them, making more friends in the long run.\n\nIf I were to name this graph, I would have it titled something along the lines of \u201cProof That Friends Are More Important Than Money\u201d.",

It seems as if when everyone is required to be all together for 8+ hours a day (ie in a high school or a workplace) the ability to make friends is about equal. This is most likely due to the group mentality and not having other commitments during those hours. Though, in the neighborhood people with lower income are most likely to make friends in the neighborhood. this is possibly attributed the space between homes. Lower income housing is often apartments whole high income people can have much more land and space between homes. This space between homes could make it more difficult to find friends when one doesn't see them all the time. \n2) I wonder if these graphs would look different if it surveyed people living in rural areas verses metropolitan areas. \nHow does this relate to you and your community?\n3) Going to a private school, many of the people I interact with and am friends with are all from similar high income families.  Yet, the income, proved by these graphs, doesn't impact how likely I am to make friends. \n4) Graphs: A How-To on Finding Friends",

In high school, the central 50% /average income makes slightly more friends than the average.

This graph had a more significant upwards/positive curve then the previous, showing how much more weight a higher income holds in college than in high school, where presumably less people have their own income. Then at work, the graph more closely resembles that of highschool, probably because you're usually surrounded by people making around the same as you. In the neighborhood, the graph was also curved but now in a negative way, the lowest 25th percentile being 1.9x more likely than average to make friends. \n2) What do you wonder?\nI wonder how the statistics vary when you view whether people of different incomes make more or less friends in general?\n3) How does this relate to you and your community?\nComing from a lower income community, this graph is relatable because it shows how people with lower incomes are more likely to befriend one another then people with higher incomes- probably due to the heightened sense of community those who make less tend to foster.\n4) What\u2019s going on in this graph?\nMy title would be \"Does Money Buy Friends?\"",

In college, people make an exponentially higher amount of friends, almost 2.5 times the average, when they have a higher income. I am curious whether this is because having a job in college exposes people to more opportunities to make friends. In neighborhoods, people who make less money make more friends. The lowest level of income has more than twice the average number of friends. In the workplace, more friends are likely with average pay than a higher or lower income. \nI wonder mostly why income is being compared to friends and if the two are realistically related.

Lower income communities tend to be closer together (houses - in proximity) which usually results in friendly relationships/friendships, whereas higher income communities are spread out and less relationships are built. \n\nHeadline: Does friendship come at a cost?",

Almost everyone goes to high school an equal amount, so the chance of making friends is the same regardless of income. For college, individuals with lesser income are less likely to go to college than for higher income students, so it would make sense that higher income students make more friends there. At work, the highest income people are probably CEOs who may live a lavish lifestyle or are used to being in an authoritarian position, so they may make less friends than the average employee. In the neighborhood, lesser income neighborhoods are generally more close together and on average will probably have a greater sense of unity, so lower income households will likely have a greater chance of making friends.\n\nWhat do you wonder? - I wonder what the total number of friends made is for each income level. Do lower income households have more total friends than higher income households?\n\nHow does this relate to your community? - I'm only a high schooler, but depending on my income in the future, I may have an easier or harder time to make friends (compared to the average) in the future.\n\nCatchy headline - Does making money = making friends?",

This relates to me because it is good to note that friends are made in many ways and your income does have an impact on who I am friends with. This relates to my community because it demonstrates how they all might have met each other and illustrates the potential of who is more likely to be friends with who. For example lower income neighborhoods might now each other better than high income neighborhoods. While in contrast a work environment of middle income people may be more friendly.\n4. I noticed the shape of the graph for making friends in high school and at work is more symmetric and unimodal. Whereas making friends in college is left skewed and making friends in the neighborhood is right skewed. This demonstrates how it is more normal for people at all income levels to make friends at work or in high school.

It is relevant to my community because where friends are made is heavily tied to current issues like accessibility, transportation, and available time outside of work and school.\n\nIn the graphs, the \u201cIn high school\u201d section shows that most people make an average number of friends in high school, regardless of income. In \u201cAt work,\u201d this difference is more pronounced, with the middle-income percentile making the highest percentage of friends in the workplace. In the \u201cIn college\u201d graph, it is clear that those with a higher income make a larger percentage of their friends in college.

These higher-income students usually may not nee to work while in college as well so they have more time to spend with friends. I found your idea interesting of how making friends with a higher income in college could increase opportunities. I agree that this could explain the graph as well!",

However, lower income people are 0.3x the average likeliness to make friends in college. In contrast, high income people are 0.3x less likely to make friends in the neighborhood, whereas lower income people are 1.9x more likely than the average. \nI wonder if lower income students are less likely to make friends in college because they either cannot afford college or are busy working jobs to help afford college, as it is so expensive. Additionally, in lower income areas, the houses are closer together so it is easier to make friends with neighbors. However, in very wealthy neighborhoods, the houses are more spread out, which makes it harder to know their neighbors. \nThis affects me because my area has a large range of incomes, so this projects when the kids I grew up with will be more likely to make friends. I also have noticed that the lower income areas have a closer knit community in my area. \n\"The Cost of Friendship\"",

The blue portions of the bars represent those who make more friends than average in that location.\n\nI wonder how the answers would have changed if they were to poll a larger age demographic than just people between the ages of 25 to 44.\n\nI observe that across all of the income levels people tend to make friends in high school. The is likely because high school is a universal experience, relatively independent of income. It is similar for the work graph. The middle class (30th-80th) percentiles make the most friends at work. The friendship levels at college showcase more of a stark difference. The upper wealth classes (60th-100th) are well above average in making friends in college. This is due to the fact that college is very expensive, meaning that it would be the foremost place for wealthy people to make friends. The opposite is true for the neighborhood. Those in the lowest income levels report making the most friends in this location.\n\nThis relates to me and my community in the sense that I am currently in high school, where friendship is equal across income levels. However, it is necessary to understand the ways that income can affect all areas of our lives.

I wonder if as college becomes more accessible to lower income families, could the ratio for \"in college\" even out? It may eventually become more even, similar to high school, as college becomes easier to attend for people of all income backgrounds, rather than just people with higher income. \n\n3.

I wonder if part of the reason for this is because lower class kids do not dorm at college so they have less oppurtunities to make friends, whereas college kids with a steady and good income have an easier time making friends.

There is a slight increase around the middle 50% of income and slight dips at both extremes. This is similar to the graph of those making friends at work. This could be because people in high schools don't necessarily care much about their classmates' income, and they make friends with them based on who they are instead of how much they make. Similarly, it is possible that those that work together may not care as much about how much their colleague makes because they all work in the same environment. I also notice that income plays a role in making friends in college and neighborhoods. In college, people who. make a higher income are 2.4x more likely to make friends, while in the neighborhood, it's the reverse; people who make a lower income are 1.9x as likely to make friends. I wonder why this is. Is it because people in college want to go on experiences and trips, so they become friends with people who make more money?

The main thing that stands out is how those with higher income levels are more likely to meet their friends in college in comparison to the average.  People with higher incomes typically have jobs that require college degrees so this makes sense.  On the other end of the spectrum, lower income individuals are more likely to meet their friends in their neighborhood compared to others.  They are not likely to meet friends at college.  This is most likely because those with lower income jobs may not need a college degree.  Those who met friends in work or at high school have relatively the same numbers that are close to the average.

This graph's scale presents additional information not seen in the others; the top end of collegiate friend-makers are 2.4x the national average, significantly higher than the next highest proportion, low income people in the neighborhood. One interpretation of this data is that the highest earners in our society exclusively draw social connections from the elite institutions they attend. There may be some cause and effect relationship here, but that is definitely another question. The social effect of this phenomenon is most certainly noticeable in our society, where wealthy people stay insulated within themselves, and as the graph shows, rarely interact with those in their neighborhood.\n2. I wonder if there is a cause and effect relationship between these studied variables. Are wealthy people more likely to have become wealthy if they made more friends in college?\n3.

People of all incomes seem fairly equally likely to make friends in high school, as well as the likelihood of making friends at work being fairly distributed, with it being somewhat more likely for middle-income people. I wonder why friendships from high school are so evenly distributed. Maybe it's because of our country's system of free education through 12th grade, while the reason richer people are more likely to have friends from college is because they're more likely to be able to afford going to college at all. Though that begs the question of why are rich people so much less likely to make friends in their communities? They have houses. They have neighborhoods. Do higher income people spend too much time with work to participate in community socialization? No, because if that were the case, rich people should be more likely to have friends from work, which they aren't. Strange. I wonder about the reasons for these differences in friendships because I'm not sure what income my future will lead me to. Will a certain path cause me to develop friendships with certain people less easily? The graph doesn't make clear why, but it looks likely that if I manage to become wealthy, I may not have a good relationship with my community members.

I also wonder what would change about the data if it was collected by people in a different or wider age range.\n3) These graphs relate to me and my community because I make friends at school. I also relate to this because my mother invites her friends from work to our house a lot.\n4) \"Money doesn't always have to do with making friends, but it does help if you bribe them!\" -(Lauren A. 2023)",

What did I notice?\nI notice that in the 'in college' graph, on the higher income end, people are 2.4 times more likely than average, while in the 'in the neighborhood' graph the lower end only has 1.9 times more likely. This means that income doesn't have as much of an effect in neighborhoods when compared to colleges. Both in high school and at work show little variation due to income, meaning income has virtually no impact.\n2. What do I wonder?\nAre \"Rich Neighborhoods\" more introverted than low-income neighborhoods? \n3. How does this relate to me?\nSince I don't expect myself to be very rich in college, I need to focus on getting friends now, while in high school, at work, and in my neighborhood. \n4.

    "comment info": "1. I noticed that making friends in high school has little to do with your income. If anything, people coming from the middle class might have a SLIGHTLY higher chance in making your friends in high school. In college, the more income you have the greater chance of making friends. That makes sense for multiple reasons such as college is expensive. Similar to high school, there isn't much of a correlation to income levels and making friends. However, there is more correlation than in high school. The middle class tends to make more friends at work than the high or low class. Finally, if you have less income, you are more likely to make more friends in your neighborhood. This also makes sense for a variety of reasons such as people with lower income might only have the opportunity to meet people in their neighborhood.\n2. I wonder how the data might change if the user ages were different. Or how the data would change if it was based on gender.\n3. Because of my age, I haven't been to college or had a job yet so my experience is slightly skewed. However, I would say since I tend to be surrounded with higher income families, many friends are met in college and NOT in the neighborhood, which matches the graphs.\n4. Because the graph has to do with the correlation between income and where people make friends, I think a catchy headline would be, \u201cCan Money Buy Friends?\u201d",

How does this relate to you and your community?\nAlmost everyone goes to high school, so they should feel fairly comfortable finding friends with the same ideas/background.

And impoverished neighborhoods may be a good place for the less fortunate to connect with people who are in their same boat. \n4. What\u2019s going on in this graph?

This makes sense because almost the entire population would be engaged in high school and work environments. However, when it comes to college, there is a strong correlation between higher income and friends made in college; this makes sense because generally, careers stemming from a college education have higher incomes, and therefore those with higher incomes would have likely gone to college, and consequently made more friends in college. When it comes to neighborhoods, there is a strong correlation between lower incomes and making friends. This also makes sense because those who have higher incomes are less likely to live in communal neighborhoods, and therefore are less likely to make friends within a neighborhood. This graph is, as a gestalt, commenting on the fact that everyone makes friends in their own group, more likely or unlikely based on the fact that lower incomes are correlated with neighborhood living, and higher incomes are correlated with college and higher education.

    "comment info": "1) I noticed that in high school, the amount of friends one may have tends to stay the same regardless of their income. However, in college there seems to be a connection between income and the amount of friends one has. There is a 2.4% increase when it comes to having more friends as long as their income also increases. Similarly to the increase, there is a 0.3% decrease in friends for those who have a smaller source of income. At work, making friends is similar to that of highschool with only the tiniest difference of income. While there is this difference, it does not have a significant impact on making friends. Alongside this, the bar representing those who make friends in their neighborhood seems to be skewed to the right as the likelihood of making friends is opposite to that of college.\n\n2) I wonder why people let income influence whether they want to have friends or not. Why is it that friends come and go based directly on income in college? I also wonder what these graphs might look like in other countries where there are more influences. \n\n3) This relates to me and my community since we come from a pretty low-income area. Our town isn't as big either, which allows so many of us to start off with friends that may follow us into college since we've grown up with them.

They are both relatively symmetric and have peaks in the middle. College is skewed to the left because income is an important thing for college. You\u2019re more likely to go to a bigger college/university if you have more income or help paying for it. Therefore you are more likely to make more friends and be a part of things like sororities or frats, school clubs, etc. The neighborhood I believe is more based on values than money. Those who are in the middle class or less fortunate are more likely to view friends as something more important to them and those who live close to them are people they can rely on. \n2- I wonder what the definition of a \u201cfriend\u201d is and how much the income is and how many people and what kind of people were considered to use for this graph.\n3- In my community we have a neighborhood (subdivision) called \u201cOld Barn.\u201d I happen to live right across from it and in my experience I don\u2019t talk to my neighbors who live right across the street.

In high school and at work, the graphs, on average, seem to differ minimally per income and are mostly symmetric across the board. The neighborhood is skewed to the right which reflects higher frequency of lower income friendships, and in college, its the opposite idea; skewed left, having the higher income friendships dominating. This leads the observer to begin to question the context of the graph, to make a claim about areas of friends. In high school and in the work place is the reason its symmetric because, you are forced to spend the majority of your time in this place, and here and there, it may kindle a friendship, but overall, it can create burnout, and it reciprocated symmetrically, regardless of income, its the human psychology? And because higher income people usually have more opportunity for college, is it easier and less stressful to get more friends? Lower income may spend a lot of time at home and less travel and college experience so does that call for relations within the proximity of their incomes? This relates to me as a high school student, as we all have to be here 7 hours a day and we have classes with certain people, and it combines all incomes, so the element of money is canceled in this atmosphere, people make friends with who they are around.

This shows that those who are richer tend to make friends in areas where strangers may be present, and lower-income people tend to make more friends in areas where people are closer and more familiar. \n\nI wonder why something like having money can lead to having significantly higher rates of meeting friends in college, but not in the workplace or in high school, which are somewhat similar environments. I wonder what aspect of the neighborhood makes rich people unable to meet friends in that area, to such a low degree. \n\nIn a lower income area, we tend to basically never see people in the higher income category, so being able to relate or make friends with people like that in our area would be nearly impossible, and as I am about to enter college as a high school senior, I may notice it more difficult to find friends when the more wealthy statically have an advantage over me in that department.  \n\nHow Money Really Can Buy Happiness: Where the Most Wealthy Make the Most Friends.",

There is a bit of a dip for people who have an extremely low and high income, but it's nothing significant, it probably does not correlate. In college there definitely seems to be a correlation to income and friends. As income increases, the likelihood of making friends also increases. The most extreme cases being  2.4% increase in likelihood to make friends for people with a higher income, and a 0.3% decrease in those who have a low income.  Work is sort of similar to highschool where the income doesn't seems to have  a significant impact on the likelihood of making friends, it is important to note that it is a bit more extreme than high school, but no major difference. In the neighborhood the likelihood of making friends seems to be the opposite of college.\n\n2. I wonder what causes these correlations, like what causes the interest to want to become friends with someone who makes more money? I mean it makes sense in college, you would want to become friends with people who have more money because they're more likely to go out and party, which is something a lot of people at that age do.\n\n3.

Take the college graph, the clearest indicator of a correlation between wealth and the ability to make friends. First and foremost, lower-income families and children from those families don't have access to college, but that's relatively clear and obvious. What isn't so obvious is the fact that those few low-income children who do have the chance to go to college might a. have to work a job in order to pay their tuition or b. they're hyper-aware of the opportunity college presents and they want to make the best of it. \n\n2. What questions is this supposed to raise? We know there's a huge educational schism between the wealthy and the poor, so what can be done to not only bridge the gap educationally but also make the experiences of those low-income students more beneficial from a social standpoint.\n\n3.  I'm fortunate enough to go to a really fantastic school with incredible people and teachers surrounding me every day, but I've never taken any time to consider the effects that come from a different socioeconomic class that the majority of students in the school come from might mean socially.

The impact this has on my community and I is that it will tell me how many friends I am going to make in different parts of my life and how much income I am going to make, and they are going to make. For example, I am currently in high school and my schoolmates and I are making the same amount of friends and we have very similar incomes.

For example people with lower income make friends in the neighborhood this could be because if you are lower income you most likely live in row homes or houses closer together which could make you talk to your neighbors more. In contrast people with higher incomes have houses further apart which might be why they dont make as many friends because they dont live as close together where they would have to talk to their neighbors.",
