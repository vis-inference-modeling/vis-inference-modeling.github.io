Anxiety and depression may stand out to be one of the critical problems ever have to face. Teenagers are having this feeling because of their social or personal life problems. One of the thing that impulse on teenager is doing an activity that makes them to regret one day in the future. People who are having these emotion could lead to drug and gangster life. This could harm their whole career in their lives. The addiction on a thug life they have, might be the main reason for them to have these sentiment feeling. More of the focus in today people have been shed on depression more than gangster life and drug addiction. With therapy and whatever kind of medication they need, we, Americans could relived the depression and anxiety teenagers have. This could lead to a healthy life for every teen in this country.",

Since anxiety and depression gives a developing mind strong impulses to do something they might actually do that but regret it later.  For example, depression could cause someone to experience drugs because they had an impulse to just feel happiness again, even if it is for a short while.  They get addicted, and depression is the cause for their addiction.",

Stuff like anxiety and depression bullying and drugs. The friends that i know that killed them selfs, that were in college, was because of those reasons. \n\nFor the poverty and gangs and teen pregnancy, is more of the minor thing, becuase that is when the minors thing there are too much, they think they could do this when they really cant. \n\nThe thing that i say about teen pregnancy is that the reason it is minors getting it more, is because, majors have more to do in two years. U are a teen major is only 2 years (18,19) and it is much longer time period for minors to get pregnant than it is for the major for teens.\n\nFor drinking alcohol, i feel like for the drinking alcohol drug addiction, is higher for majors, becuase when they are a major. They are in college. And there not living with their parents. So they think they could not get caught as easily. That is why i feel like that is higher for majors than minors.",

Of course, are mean people who do bully kids but I would definitely say drug addiction is much higher. I  also wonder why gangs are the lowest.

Each topic that is associated with a student can lead to trauma, use of drugs, or even death. I understand why anxiety and depression would be viewed as the most major because each topic listed below that, is an event that can end to a result of depression. For example, being in a gang is traumatizing and stressful. When teens get pregnant they completely break down, not knowing what decision to make next in the process. When a student is not as wealthy as their friends, money starts piling onto their daily lives, causing stress. Drinking and the use of drugs leads to changes in mood, lack of structure, and feeling lonely/useless. Lastly, bullying creates a sharp pain in a person leading them to be damaged for a long time due to how poor the student is getting treated. Notice how all the topics I just explained lead to anxiety and depression? These events pile onto a persons work load and once the load is to much they crash to the bottom which is the feeling of stress, loneliness, and sometimes, it can be emptiness. The bullying, gangs, pregnancies, etc become to much for a student to handle and they break down feeling completely useless. Luckily, I am happy and healthy. But, it hurts to look around my school to see the boy who's not accepted, the girl who overdosed on drugs, the girl who was kicked out of the house, etc.",

If the rates appear the same then the rise in concern could be from population growth or the issue may be larger than it appears. I'm not trying to say that anxiety and depression are good or not as big of a deal than it is but there could be other reasons why it's becoming a large issue.",

Though doing drugs and drinking alcohol are easy to avoid, once addicted, it is not as simple to quit. With anxiety and depression, mental health issues cannot be controlled at times. Poverty is also not easy to control; if you are born into a bad situation theres not much you can do. Teen pregnancy and gang affiliations on the other hand are more avoidable. I wonder if and how we can reduce all these problems. Are there people who are working on lowering these issues? if so, how are they addressing them?",

I think it's sad that bullying is such a big theme and only 10 percent don't worry about it at all. The fact that anxiety & depression are in first place doesn't surprise me at all, i know many people who also suffer from depression and i think it's a very difficult and serious topic.

I also believe that not shouldnt be an option because every single one of the things on the list is important and impacts teenagers in some shape or form. \nI wonder what the graph would look like if it was just different kinds of mental illness and what people think affects teenagers the most.

This says a lot to me for I believe they both have very big relation to school and fear these things for themselves and others. As for the other 5 choices, they are things that often occur outside of class. What I can take from this and what I hope schools can too, is that the workload and contents in class is very big and many students find it difficult to go through. Schools focus on other things, such as the other 6, any yes, although they are big problems, they are not as big as a problem to high school students like the anxiety and depression they face due to school.",

Only one in ten thought it was not an issue. This shows just how pervasive bullying is. \n   Bullying is everywhere in current life. It could be someone teasing someone else who is not enjoying it. It could be someone cyberbullying. Regardless of the type, it is very common. Everyone sees it but does nothing to stop it.

This is mostly due to social media and high expectations and pressure to succeed. Bullying is a close second to anxiety, cyberbullying has become too easy for teens. People can hide behind a screen and sometimes do this anonymously. In addition, drug addictions and alcohol are also pretty high up there. Unfortunately, most teenage social scenes revolve around drugs and alcohol. These younger generations have become much more exposed to new affairs that the older generations were not exposed to at such a young age. I think this is mainly due to phones, social media, a need for popularity, social stress, and need to be the best.\n\nI wonder why suicidal thoughts are not amongst these issues, as I feel like it is rapidly increasing lately.

I infer these results from the percentages listed on the bar graph, with the dark green representing major problems, lighter green representing minor problems, and the lightest green representing no problems. For the most part, anxiety and depression are considered the biggest problems among teens according to the graph. I wonder why this is so. Perhaps more awareness and education about mental illness could play a role. I also wonder why most teens are not as concerned about gangs as they are about anxiety and depression.

The data of this survey is appropriate to the ongoing events today, as teen suicide is a major problem in the United States today, and these two problems - mental health and bullying - are contributing factors to this tragic problem. It is interesting to observe that the majority of teens surveyed did not think poverty was a major problem. An explanation for this may be due to the geographic region of the survey (if it was taken in a wealthy area, then poverty may not be a concern for them.

Parents and teachers tend to blame technology and social media as the reason why a student is doing bad at school but in reality, it is the stress and work that the school is putting on the student that is causing the student to fall behind. This should give them a message that they need to find solutions or ways to prevent anxiety and depression, bullying, and all the problems that teenagers see among their peers in order to ensure the success of students in school and life. They may not be able to solve the problems of the world of teenagers, but they could put more attention to their student's challenges.",

    "comment info": "I noticed that anxiety and depression has the largest percentage in the \"major category\". This is probably because, arguably, when children or youth begin to mature they experience a lot of a mood swings. However, anxiety and depression are often results of environmental factors rather than a natural occurrence. Self-management is often key to managing and controlling emotional and mental health. What I do wonder is if this illustration has to do anything with the education system. Often teenagers are subject to a lot of pressure from the expectations of their parents. Education puts teenagers in a competitive environment where they are expected to at least perform academically well to compared their peers. When they fail to meet those expectations, teenagers often are in a fixed mindset that they could've done better. This creates a lot of anxiety due to pressure from their parents and societal norms. As a high school student, I can relate.",

Teen pregnancy is a very selective problem as it only applies to teenage girls, not to mention there is a correlation between poverty and teen pregnancy, usually relating to the racially minority population. Anxiety & depression, or more over, mental illness can be argued as a topic that only recently has been spoken freely and openly about. Not to mention mental illnesses affect more than just a certain race, gender, age gap, or any other social group. It affects the rich the same as it does to the poor, women and men alike, of all races. Similarly, bullying has become a more often topic to be talked about though not dealt with as well as it should be. Nonetheless, it has become a big issue that has been occurring more often than before and also gets related to other serious problems, such as; anxiety, depression, students dropping out, and more. So not only is it problems that have more recently been talked about and can affect any person, bullying and mental illnesses are connected to and bring many other problems with them.",

The tension brought on by this by our parents to succeed is really what brings this sense of anxiety when kids are just waiting for a test score or getting anxious about a test and if they don't get their result, they spiral in bad thought and it starts to make this hole that they can't get out of which is really hurting us as people. Another factor, in my opinion, is the amount of external input from songs to books they have supposedly explained exactly how you must feel if you are depressed and truly depressed people relate to it but when these people who don't truly know what it is start to listen to these songs they start doubting and if they can relate to the smallest thing they blow it up and think they have depression without knowing what it is and that just skews this graph so much.",

If this were categorized in a table chart based on the highest percentages of each issue (where the highest % is at the top and the lowest % is at the bottom; 3 columns for major, minor, and not a problem are the \"x-values\"; each issue is categorized based on what students believe in the least of the their problems), then there would be more points of relativity and association with it.",

Things like drug addiction and alcohol are problems that teens in my area go through because at the beginning when first trying these substances, they take it as no big deal. These surveys should be taken from all over the country so that there is more of an accurate graph of information. I also believe that there is something that needs to be done about depression and anxiety in teens everywhere because it is a rising issue that is going on with teens. Even on the graph, it is still depicted as the biggest major issue and I think that it would still be the biggest issue no matter where the survey was taken.",

If these problems aren't addressed in our society then I think that these problems will increase in our society making it a real epidemic. However, we first need to get accurate information by surveying people around the world so then we can stop these problems quickly.",

    "comment info": "I think that the students in the survey had different answers depending on where the live. For example, if a teen lived in a better off neighborhood than in one with more poverty they will respond different to some of the questions like gangs or any of them really. Also I believe that drug and alcohol addiction can come form people around you influencing you to do that, the easier access you have to things makes it easier to fall into the wrong decisions because you are tempted to fit in or maybe people around you choose to deal with their problems in this way and you see them so you think it's ok, when really it's not you are just damaging your own body. The students who said these things are not issues most likely come from a better of place. The students who think these are major issues might come from a lower income community. I think this is true for most of the problems, except I feel that anxiety, depression and bullying is something more world wide. I don't believe where you live has anything to do with that because anywhere you are people can be mean and hurt you intentional or not. Also stress and family problems and cause anxiety and depression. Anything bad or stressful can cause these things to happen. Like a traumatizing experience to just day to day struggles. Another factor that may play into the results might be how aware one is to their surroundings. Maybe just because you weren't going through any of these you though that no one around you was either.",

I would assume it's the pressure put on them by the school system, on top of everything else they deal with. That may not be the case, but that's what makes the most sense to me.\n\nI also realize teen pregnancy seems to be pretty low on the chain, and that is probably due to the amount of time spent teaching children how big of an issue it is and how to prevent it.\n\nAlso, I believe that a lot of these issues could be tied to one another, leading from one issue into the next. Say someone is being bullied, given that it's the second biggest problem on this list. That bullying leads to depression. Depression could lead to substance abuse, such as drinking and doing drugs.\n\nI feel like if we can do our best to help prevent and create solutions to some of these issues, it will create a domino effect that will help to decrease others as well.",

It shows just how big of a problem each one is with anxiety and depression at the top and gangs at the bottom. While I see this as an accurate prediction, I was quite surprised when I saw that drugs and alcohol weren't at the top of the list. Another concern that I had was that some of these problems cause one another, so a suspected raise in one could really just be an effect of another. For example, alcohol addiction in which only 45% believed it to be major could be the leading cause for 70% in anxiety and depression. But other than things like that, I agree with these statistics and can see all of these problems where I live. A catchy title could be \"Teens Test The Truth,\" because we are the ones giving these statistics to the world. We are the ones that have to make these problems known, and we are the ones who have to end them.",

Here in Canada, teens would have similar concerns. As a 13 year-old, Drug addiction and Drinking alcohol are not concerns my age group, yet 50% of the people surveyed believed it was. I am curious as to why these two options are included in this graph because the age group surveyed are not legally allowed to drink or use these substances. I also wonder why Bullying isn't at the top of this graph because many of these issues can be contributed by bullying. Another thought I had was that some of these topics are vague, such as Anxiety, Depression, and Bullying, as they could be more specific. For example, Anxiety and Depression can be caused by the lack of socializing due to the overuse of social media and video games. Bullying can be separated into cyber, verbal, physical or racism because each has its own effects. I believe a catchy headline for this graph would be, \"Bullying has Become a Major Teenage Problem.\" I think this is a good topic because in the past, while the other options were already big concerns, bullying wasn't recognized until a few years ago.",
