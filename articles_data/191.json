It seems that two tobacco companies are controlling the market, this is likely because tobacco, as a whole, has decreased in sales. Therefore, less prominent tobacco companies are probably going out of business because they are unable to lower their prices and now more and more citizens are turning to vaping. Recently, it was announced that Altria will buy a large stake in Juul. I wonder if this is taken into account and if Altria is one of the tobacco companies that is controlling the market.\n\n I understand that some companies have larger share of the market, but I wonder if these sales have gone up or down since the early 2000's. This would be interesting to include on the graph. \n\nA good name for this graph could be \"Is Sharing Caring?\" I thought of this because when two companies share a large portion of the market is this beneficial to the economy overall? Or, would it be better for there to be more competition with more companies?",

I find it quite interesting that most of these categories have experienced growth in the market share percentage over time. I find it interesting that the early 2000s are considered to be 2002-2007 in this graph, and yet the technology companies only start from 2012. This signifies the rise of importance of technology such as smartphones and other devices which people have come to depend on. It makes sense that these categories all saw growth. However, the context of the graph must also be analyzed. The graph does not show the growth of the industry, but rather the share of the market the two largest companies of each category hold. This speaks to how the main companies have overall gained more control over the market in most recent years, making a case for people to say that large companies are beginning the approach to a near monopoly in future years. There were only five categories which experienced a decrease in market share. This exemplifies the decrease of these industries and therefore the decrease of the want to have a monopoly in them.

    "comment info": "Personally, I find this graph to be very intriguing. I will be the first to say that I am not knowledgable (and honestly a bit lost) in the areas of stock markets, finance, etc. However, it is interesting to see how the percentage of the market that certain industries possess changed from the early 2000s to the present. For example, the tobacco industry possessed about 52% of the market in 2000, and now it has a market share of about 83%, one of the largest percentages of all industries. Back in the day, cigarettes very still prevalent. However, with the current uprising of the teenage vaping epidemic, I would say that this could be one of the main contributors to the tobacco industry's increased market share. One can also see that the smartphone industry is absolutely booming with a market share of almost 100%! Being a member of this modern technological world, it does not surprise me that the two largest smartphone companies (most likely Apple and Samsung) are making so much profit. This graph just goes to show how today's trends truly have an impact on the consumer market.",

The two power companies controlling several industries seems similar to a monopoly. Some market shares increase while some decrease. The graph for the most part increases in market share over time. Some companies increase on smaller intervals while other companies decrease slowly. As the time changes, industries change with times. If industries are not inline with the time they seem to decrease and loose market share. Could the increase be because of the monopoly or the company being inline and updated with the times and new technology?  \nA catchy headline could be Who is really in control of the markets?",

    "comment info": "I actually enjoy this graph. It is interesting to see how powerful the top two companies in each industry truly are. I can see how smartphone companies (probably with Apple as the largest) controls so much of their particular market. By convincing the public that they need a certain type of phone to properly communicate with peers, a company can create a monopoly on their industry. Nobody likes having to text their friends with Samsungs from their iPhones for several reasons (the emojis are not in sync, one cannot leave or add someone to a group chat, the sent texts are green, etc.). Another industry with a high market share of the two largest companies is hardware stores. This is probably due to chains such as Ace and Home Depot being able to maintain low prices and still make a profit, driving out of business smaller hardware stores. I think that this is a similar situation with Tobacco companies that can lower their prices.",

Many of these industries are seeing the top 2 companies really \"making their mark\" by gaining in market share. \n\nI also wonder what is going on with the tire manufacturing industry. Maybe your group could determine what the two largest companies are in the tire manufacturing industry? I wonder what is going on with those companies that is causing them to lose market share.",

I wonder what is going on in the Tire manufacturing marketing that would cause the largest companies to lose market share. I would expect a decrease in market share to be due to increased competition or some kind of business disruption with the largest manufacturers which has driven their existing customers to other existing competitors. I also noticed that the top 2 smartphone manufacturers have essentially 100% of the market which could stifle future innovation. In general, the technology markets are dominated by the top 2 companies in their industry.",
