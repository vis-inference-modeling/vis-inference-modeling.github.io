    "comment info": "Some plants and crops really do need the winter to survive/thrive. For example, some need a cold period for seeds to germinate (and some need to have extreme heat, such as a wildfire to germinate). Some need cool weather to do well after the last frost. Some can't deal with high humidity that comes with warmer weather, and will get fungal infections. And some need the cold to kill insect pests to keep from being eaten up over the growing season due to too many insects. Never mind that some beneficial animals and insects need the cold to also survive/thrive (warming climates may help mites on bees survive, creating problems for native bees, as well as honey bees). As a result, the shifting climate will almost certainly make it difficult, if not impossible to grow certain plants, and maybe even cause the extinction of some plants/crops/insects. For example, wild rice and oats do best in cooler climates, both of which are very nutritious, and wild rice is native to North America and an important crop for some Indigenous tribes.",

Even though most of the areas still remained below freezing, a lot more became around zero degrees than the more typical -26 degree in graph 1. Something I found interesting was that these were actually the lowest temperatures, not the average. So, in some states, the temperature actually never hits below 0, or even 0 degrees. Because I live in Canada, even in warmer winters we\u2019ve always reached below 0, at least where I live- in the Greater Toronto Area, and even though the southern states are closer to the equator, it is still in North America. So that part was interesting to me.\n\tWhile this graph does not directly impact my community, I can draw some conclusions. Temperatures are increasing dramatically, even in places so close to the Arctic, and that can influence plant growing rates. Even though this might not be as applicable in the winter, I can think of the changes which will occur in the summer. Places which were 20 degrees (Celsius) might rise to 25 degrees, and places which were 25 degrees might rise to 30 degrees. So, what does this mean? Many areas, especially on the border, as they are closer to the equator, will become more arid and make for harder plant growth. This is unsettling, as many agricultural products are produced in Ontario; and as already, the growing season is very short.\n\t\nHeadline: \nLows Rise as Temperatures Climb",

The key provided indicates that the hardiness zones each represent different temperature ranges of winter lows. From north to south, the numbered zones increase and shift from cooler colors to warmer colors. When comparing the 1981 - 2010 map to the 2011 - 2040 map, I noticed that the zones shift upwards; specifically, less dark green appears in the northernmost regions of the map and more dark red appears in the southernmost regions of the map.\n\nThe shift in zones also appears to affect New York, my home state. Zone 8 encroaches on the southernmost part of the state which means that winters in my community will generally only reach lows of about ten to twenty degrees Fahrenheit. Although the lows are still low enough for snowfall, they still trend closer to the freezing point than Zone 7. \n\nAfter reviewing all of the graph\u2019s data, I conclude that the graph represents the effect of climate change on American winter seasons.",

In map #2 we see that this cold area is getting smaller, northern states are slowly getting warmer.\n \nI wonder if these more central states are much colder because they are not near an ocean to help regulate/distribute their temperature better. This may account for the massive crop fields up north when we don\u2019t see farms at that scale in southern states.\n \nFlorida\u2019s hot and humid climate makes it ideal for growing many crops. These include citrus, sugarcane, tomatoes, peppers, cotton, and many more. Our most well-known agricultural product is oranges. If we look at how Florida changes in these maps, Florida is actually getting warmer. Map #1 shows most of Florida is around 30 - 40 degrees. However, in map #2 just over half of the state is in the red. This means that Florida got warmer during this period.\n \nThis graph is showing us the hardiness zones.

Third I also notice the impact these changing zones have on America's great plains. The plains make up a large portion of the American farming sector and are essential to the economy. As the temperature changes, so does the precipitation rate, which may bring about changes to soil composition. If climate change continues, land may not just be too hot but too dry or lack nutrients to farm with.   \n\nWhile some commentators may argue that this is an issue that will have minimal impact on them directly, irrespective of the fact that climate change is a global issue, the potential economic implications of a situation like this can send the American economy spiraling downwards. Farming is a billion-dollar industry that feeds into the shipping and food sales market. These industries have employees, land, etc.; without them, Americans lose jobs and industry.

Despite, not being a huge or dramatic shift in zones, the short time span in which this shift is projected to occur is alarming. This then makes me wonder how much the zones will change following the year 2040. Another question also comes to mind, considering that this graph is projecting zone movement from 2011 to 2040, what do these zones look like today in 2021?\nThis has a huge impact on my community, as it will essentially influence what agricultural products become most available for consumption. Judging from the graph there is probably going to be a rise in products that are grown in warmer climates, meanwhile those that are grown in colder climates will be come harder to obtain. Then of course comes the additional concern of other changes that climate change will bring.\nA headline that could describe what is happening in the graph is, \"The U.S. becomes warmer and growing zones shift: U.S. citizens might have to consider changing their diets or facing climate change head on.\"",

It is also noticeable that Zone 3 and 4 seem to decrease considerably. I wonder if these changes can be attributed to climate change, or if there is another pressing issue causing this.\n\nI do not think that this directly has an impact on my community and I, however, I am sure that there might be an indirect impact. One possible way it could impact us is that it might lower the price of fruits and vegetables that are grown in warm weather throughout the year. As the graph is predicting, if zones 8-10 are expanding and covering more area than before, it means higher temperatures which allow for more crops to be grown at this time in the United States. This would lower their prices as we wouldn't have to import as many fruits and vegetables throughout the year as we can grow much of it in our country.\n\nIt is quite clear in these graphs that warmer temperatures seem to be \"migrating\" northward as time goes on.

We also noticed that zone 6-10 will take over almost the whole graph in 2011-2040. The West Coast\u2019s growing zones do not change as dramatically as the rest of the growing zones. Also, the zones are relatively evenly distributed in the 1981-2010 graph but in the 2011-2040 graph they become uneven and unpredictable. We wondered some things after looking at the graph, like how this is affecting the crops that grow in the changing areas? Will the crops that grow there now be different in the future? How does this affect the prices of food? We also wondered how this will impact the United States\u2019 food supply and which crops will not be able to be produced in the US in the 2011-2040 graph that were produced in 1981-2010. This graph impacts us and our community as we live in Minnesota, which is in zone 5 of the growing season in the 2011-2040 graph. The average winter lows for this zone are -20 to -10.

The climate on the West coast has largely stayed the same throughout the last few decades. We wonder what is causing the shift to a warmer climate? How long has this trend towards a warmer climate been going for? Is this a natural occurrence throughout the last few centuries or is this a recent trend that is man made? We also wonder why the Pacific Northwest is far warmer than other northern areas? Lastly, what are these projections being based on? This shift towards a warmer climate can have major implications for our community.

Another is in the 2011-2040 graph, zones 8 and 9 grew larger from the 1981-2010 graph. We wondered what a graph dated before 1981 would look like for the United States? We also wondered what caused the warmer zones to grow larger over the years? Finally, in the far future will we eventually lose the colder zones? In our community, this can impact the amount of crops that farmers are able to grow depending on how suitable the environment is for the plants. This can also impact which plants succeed more than others. If the projected graph is correct, then the 5th zone will eventually be the majority in Minnesota overtaking the 3rd and 4th zone.

It appears that the zones toward the bottom moved northward while zones already in the north (Zones 3 and 4 for example) became much smaller in the map that predicted plant hardiness from years 2011-2040. I also noticed how winter lows appear to have increased in a larger section of the country in the second map. I wonder whether this was predicted due to rising global warming as a result of the greenhouse effect?  \n\nIt appears that a portion of Long Island is predicted to be in Zone 9, which would lead to a significant rise in temperature during winter in my community. This would most likely affect plant growth as well for those who grow their own crops or own any livestock, such as farmers. However, New York is comprised of mainly suburban and urban areas, which means plant growth may not be as large of an issue as it would be in other rural states. Regardless, these environmental changes would lead to having much warmer winters, and people who grow any crops or plants may have to find ways to maintain agricultural efficiency in order to continue to provide for themselves.\n\nA catchy headline for this graph could be, \"How Rising Temperatures May Affect Agricultural Efficiency in Your State\" because the map is primarily indicating how plant growth will be affected by higher winter lows.",

    "comment info": "The first thing that I noticed when looking at this graph was that there was a clear shift towards warmer winter lows for the projected graph when compared to the historical graph. This can be seen as the colder zones seem to be diminishing while the warmer ones are growing. After noticing that, it made me wonder why this trend was taking place. The first cause that came to mind was global warming, however I am curious as to if there might be other reasons as well. Another thing that seeing this graph made me wonder about was how this temperature shift will affect the growing of crops. Will this cause there to be new staple crops in the United States or will things still be the same? While I do think this shift in temperature is an important event as a whole, I do not think it will make a very large impact in my community. Where I live in New York is not known for its agriculture and thus it will likely not be majorly impacted by the trend shown. Furthermore, it is already fairly cold and I doubt a slight decrease in temperature would have a major impact. Despite that, if it were to have an impact I would hope that it helps raise awareness in my community about the major changes global warming is causing. Because this graph shows the historical vs. projected average winter lows, I think a catchy headline for it would be \"A Major Change In Climate: How Is Your Winter Going To Be Affected.\"",

There is more deeper red (Zone 10) in the projected graph in the southern portion than the historical graph. Zone 3 is nearly pushed out of the north by zone 4. A lot of the pockets of the lower zones also disappear in the projected graph (like in the northwestern states and the northeast).\nI wonder how this change in zones will affect American agriculture. The zones that hold a lot of agriculture (the midwest and south) seem to continue to increase greatly in temperature. Will this affect agricultural output and the health of crops, as well as soil health? I know the graph shows winter hardiness but a lot of farms continue through the winter for year-round production, and this trend likely continues into the spring and summer.\nThe area I live in, the PNW, seems to be going into the highest hardiness zones. I know a lot of people have home gardens that continue through the winter and I'd be interested to know how this will affect them as well. I also know a lot of people that enjoy winter sports in the mountains of the PNW, so will this temperature change also change the snowfall we see at higher elevations?\nHeadline: \"Warming Across America: Will Our Agriculture Adapt?\"",

Since plant hardiness refers to how likely plants are to survive in given temperatures, I anticipate plants that are heat-susceptible will have a difficult time surviving in the years to come. I also wonder how this map can be applied to other countries aside from the US.

How will climate change and increased temperatures impact not only their crop production but also their culture? In my community, I see that Long Island's plant hardiness zone will shift from zone 8 to zone 9. This will definitely impact farmers and cultivators in the area, not to mention the drastic zone changes in upstate New York.

A clear diminishing of the green area and the increased prevalence of the red hues can be identified from the original to the recent infographic.

I hypothesize that global warming and general increase of the earth's temperatures may have influenced the following changes in growing zones. \n\nI live in a more suburban, even urban zone so the agricultural aspect is not very familiar. However, based on my primary hypothesis of climate change impacting the following trends, I do think those effects are to be identified in an urban landscape. The blistering hot summers and sporadic changes in temperatures in a short span of a week may stem from the same causes. However, from a more agricultural aspect, I would assume this would change crop seasons, even advance the projections of seeding and production. \n\nThe graph itself displays a national division based on harsh winter climates, ranging from negative temperatures to 30-40 degrees.

I notice that the main difference between the top graph and the second one is that the climate is getting hotter, meaning that there is an increase in plant hardiness. I can see that the redder areas are getting even more red and appear to be pushing upwards to the north of the United States. The darker blue and green colors now appear to be faded as temperature are rising. I wonder as to what is the direct cause of the continental US getting hotter. My prediction is that this is the direct result of global warming. This is a known phenomenon that is making the globe warmer and warmer. Although this does allow plants to grow in more areas, it does make originally warm areas even hotter. This increases the risk of drought and fires. This impacts my community in the sense that the second graph predicts Massachusetts to get hotter and transition to a warmer orange color by this graph. Boston is notorious for it's naturally colder weather in the Northeast, and that recognition and way of living that many people here are accustomed to live by are jeopardized by hotter climates.

How will temperatures affect forests and parks?  How will temperatures affect animals including damaging pests?  How do temperatures and precipitation relate to each other?  This is just a start.",

It seems to be by a little bit each year, but because we are looking at 30 year spans, the shifting looks like a lot.\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder if this is also happening to other continents like Europe or Asia since the North American continent also shares the seasons with these continents, and also if Africa (the lower part) and South America are experiencing somthing similar but with the hardiness zones moving towards the south.\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis would impact the plants my city can grow. I live in a current zone 5, but by 2040 it looks like I will be living in a zone 6 instead.\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the maps\u2019 main idea.\nTropical Plants in Traditionally Colder Areas: By 2040, the hardiness zones for each plant will be slightly shifted to the north. This means that places that are in the northern part of the United States will not be able to grow warmer-area plants that they were unable to grow before.",

        "comment info": "@Abby I agree with your statement that the types of crops grown in certain areas will be affected by a temperature shift. For example, the North could grow a different crop more suitable for warmer climates since the projected graph displays warmer temperatures in the northern portion of the map. Furthermore, I think you bring up a valid question regarding the conditions on other continents.  If the temperatures seem to be getting warmer for the United States, would other parts of the world experience the same phenomenon? Are human activities to blame for the change or is it purely environmental and natural? I definitely think you make a great point which raises more interesting questions.",

I would add, what is happening to average highest summer temperatures.  I wonder if there is worldwide choropleth map?  I\u2019m going to make a search!",
