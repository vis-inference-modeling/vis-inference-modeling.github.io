I also noticed that the graph that the three oldest groups lost time in was grooming while the youngest age group lost time in exercising. \n2.) I wonder if this is completely accurate because the graph for texting, phone calls, and video chats shows that the 15-24 age group only spent 14 minutes for it which I find extremely low.\n3.) I think this relates to our community because it shows that people have taken less care of themselves over the course of the pandemic.

    "comment info": "1) I notice that ages 15-24 have had the largest increase in screen time, the biggest decrease in exercise, and are the only group that had an increase in grooming. This may be because during the pandemic people started to decide to have a glow-up or find their new selves. That can include a better schedule, more organization, a new clothing style, etc. But at the same time, the screen time thing might have been the cause for some people because when people see others do things they want to do it as well. I can see how every group had an increase in screen time because during the pandemic electronic became way more popular as people used them to communicate Plus people also used tech as a way to cure boredom.\n2) I wonder if the decrease in exercising is because of how much time people started to spend on their electronics or if it was because of safety or even both. During the pandemic I know people felt the need to stay home and not get sick but what if it was because of the electronics?\n3)The impact this has had on the community is the fact that people seem to be way more glued to their phones.

I think this is interesting because it shows that people of this age were talking to others more and doing things with other people more than doing things by themselves like working out or going on a run. I wonder why the majority of people spent less time cleaning themselves. I think the reason for this is that people felt less inclined to do things like showers or take a bath because they thought they spent their day in their house and didn't think they smelled. This affects our community because people don't feel inclined to groom themselves or go outside and meet a friend because people got so used to the comfort of their homes.

Another thing I noticed is that the only age that has improved with hygiene is 15-24 yrs.\n2) I wonder if everyone is going on calls and texting more often because they got used to it in the pandemic and now it is a new way of living on a daily basis. I think that the reason why most people from ages 15-24 are exercising less is that they are on technology more often, and it is taking up the time they used to exercise. I think that most people over the age of 24 are going down with their hygiene and self-care because the pandemic had a lot more stressful impact on people who are 25+ yrs.\n3) This relates to my community because I have noticed the big change in technology use among people my age after covid.

The amount of screen time went up in every age group, and exercising went down in the younger age group but increased in every other group. Now that we can talk face to face again, we (the younger group) find it difficult to get away from screens and exercise more.

We need our phones to communicate with one another but tell me how is it a good way to role model to the younger ones that are in coming to those of us that will be departing this lifetime?",

    "comment info": "First, I noticed that people generally had an increase in texting, phone calls, and video chats between 2019-2020. Next, I'm wondering about the graph about grooming. I'm curious as to why there's a 0.4-minute increase for people aged 15-24, but a decrease with everyone older than that. I'm guessing most people 15-24 are able to take more time to groom themselves now that there isn't as much pressure to be in a rush. As for how it relates to my community, I think it relates to my community because it gives me a general idea as to what people of different age groups do with time off of work and school during the pandemic. Lastly, what's happening in these graphs is a general survey on what people had an increase/decrease of during the pandemic.

Gen-Z rates for excersize decreased by alot while millenials and boomers started excersizing alot more. Though, for grooming and self care Gen-Z's were the only ones that began to start cleaning themselves more unlike boomers and millenials. I wonder why millenials and boomers' rates for grooming decreased instead of increasing. The way that I can relate to this is that all group ages have begun to use their technology more ever since the pandemic hit. I noticed that Gen-Z, including me have started showing more signs in self care and cleansiness.

I also noticed that even the elderly went up on texting, phone calls, and video chats because of the pandemic when they were probably calling their family to check in on them during quarantine.  One thing that really surprised me is that during the Covid pandemic lockdown, a lot of people started to exercise more while the younger group started exercising a lot LESS. For grooming, it surprised me how much most of them went down and the youngest group grooming went up by a lot which surprised me because after looking at the other charts I would think that in the grooming chart the youngest group would have the least amount of grooming, just like they have the least amount of exercising and the most amount of texting, phone calls, and video chats during the pandemic. In my opinion, I would think that texting would go up by a lot more for ALL of the age groups, not just the youngest one. I would also not be surprised if ALL of the exercises went up or down. Not where all of them go up by more than the electronic chats and the youngest group(15-24) went down by a lot in the exercising section while they went up in the electronic chatting section. For grooming, I would think that all of the age groups would either go up or down(mostly down) in the charts because of the Covid pandemic lockdown. We probably use electronic messaging more because we need to talk to family.",

I'm guessing most people 15-24 are able to take more time to groom themselves now that there isn't as much pressure to be in a rush.

In my opinion that is sad to see, we are seeing a generation that just does what the internet is doing, and is heavily influenced by the internet. From these graphs it also shows the difference between younger age groups compared to older age groups, for example, 15-24 was the biggest change on the graph for exercise, phone usage, and grooming. From this graph, in the future the next younger generation would likely be higher then 15-24 group right now.",

I also notice that those ages 15-24 were the only ones to have a decrease in exercising, but they do still exercise the most out of all age groups. In addition,  they were the only age group to have an increase in grooming, albeit 0.4 minutes. However, compared to the decrease the other age groups had, 2. it makes me wonder what's special about this age group. Well, this age group is still going through school or college, and obviously, the elephant in the room, 2020 was the year COVID-19 struck. This means students were doing school virtually, and had more free time. So then, why did exercising decrease? Probably because all public gyms had closed, and most people would be scared to go on walks, because, well, the answer is fairly self-evident. Other age groups might be able to workout in their own home, but probably not college students. Grooming makes sense to me, since college students probably didn't have much time to take care of themselves before the pandemic, so during the pandemic, not too much changed, even a slight increase in how much they groom themselves, while other age groups didn't prioritize it as much.\n3. This relates to me and my community since everyone experienced and was impacted by the pandemic, and I identify with these graphs a lot.\n4.

For everyone older than 25 there seems to be a slight increase in phone texting, calls, and video chat but there is also an increase in exercise which creates a positive correlation. It also seems that grooming increased slightly for people from 15-24 but decreased for everyone else older.\n2) I wonder how the people from 25+ increased their exercise and technology usage but their grooming decreased which creates a quite interesting correlation between the 3 factors. I wonder how this correlation will change in the future and if it will stay as a constant or will it change?\n3. Over the global pandemic and certainly when the lockdown first happened people were using technology to communicate with each other. I think over time people were trying to find things to do and decided to spend time outside by taking walks and enjoying nature. It made people find other things to do than just use technology and may have created healthy habits or created even worst habits such as being stuck to the use of technology.\n4.  I think the use of this graph was created to display peoples use of technology and how they took care of themselves over the pandemic\n\"Smart or Bad Choices\"",

I also notice for exercising that exercising decreased from 19-20 for the 15-24 age group, it seems like the pandemic made teenagers less motivated to exercise in depression. I see a huge decrease in grooming for the 15-24 age group from 2019-20. \n\nWhat do u wonder? \n\nI wonder if elderly people in the exercise criteria increased since the pandemic made them more motivated to go for a walk or ride a bike.

It seems like in Andover there were more people going for walks in 2020 just to get out of the house during quarantine.

Exercising decreased probably due to gyms closing and not being able to go to the gym so people worked out at home. Self care decreased due to everyone being home and not going out as much.\n2. What do you wonder?\nWhy would older people not take care of themselves more when they have a lot more free time? Why would 15-20 year olds exercise less when they have more free time? \nI had so much more free time with covid that I would go mountain biking everyday and spend more time hanging out with friends in person outdoors (limiting chances of catching covid). Why didnt many other people take advantage of this free time.\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nThe impact was huge on my community because people weren't going out as often and the only stores that were open were \u201cessential\u201d (gas stations, Super Markets, costco). My town was also a ghost town for a good while and there were less cars on the streets. \n4. What's going on in this graph?

I also noticed that the younger people had more time to text. phone, etc then the older age groups \n\n2: I wonder why older people are on the phone more than younger people. I also wonder why the older age group's grooming time has decreased by a rate of 4- 7 minutes, while younger people's grooming time has increased. \n3: The graph relates to me because I do see myself on technology as well as exercising more than ever due to the virus keeping us inside and school being online as well. \n\n4: What I saw going on the graph is that young people are higher on the graph of grooming and texting, video calls but not on exercising. The age group of 65+ fell by -7 minutes in terms of grooming but the age group of 15-24 had an increase of 0.4. In the exercising graph young people had a decrease instead of an increase compared to another age group. The age of 15-24 had a hug increase of 8 minutes on the first graph.",

What surprised me was that it had not decreased during all this time. It made sense, perhaps during the beginning of the pandemic and quarantine, when regulations were high. Back then, video chats were the only way you could communicate with your friends. But now, most students have gotten their vaccines, and the younger ones who haven\u2019t got them don't need them to see friends. Face-to-face is now common in day-to-day life, and students already spend 6 hours a day interacting with others. After school, they hang out at the park to play basketball. They don\u2019t exactly prefer to video chat with each other; at least, I can\u2019t imagine why they would.\nEven though we\u2019re moving away from the secluded society which was the result of coronavirus, we have not changed our habits. Maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re lazy, maybe it\u2019s because we find that our new habits suit us better. Whatever the reason, we\u2019re changing and developing as a society, making new adaptations as time passes. Perhaps we\u2019ll never go back to the old normal, but instead stay at an ongoing normal.\nHeadline: Are We as Adaptable as Our Environment?",

Many older generations started picking up younger habits like longer periods of time on their cellphones. Many generations spent most of their time exercising while the generation from 15-24 decreased their time on exercising. We wondered why it could be that all generations raised their level of usage on cell phones? Could it be since we had more spare time more people became more interested in what was offered on the internet?",

However, some took advantage of their time and started getting more active and exercising, while some let their bodies go and were unmotivated to get out and do some physical activity. I found it interesting that even people at the age of atleast 65 let their phone usage go up, even if it was just a little day by day. I expected exercising in my age group to go down, but didn't realize by how much. In all the other groups, exercise went jup or stayed the same, showing older people made better use of their time during the pandemic than younger people did. Grossest part was to see how the pandemic demotivated people to shower, and this affected older people the most, as they had the highest average. The pandemic impacted our community greatly in all these ways, showing how we were all affected differently, and how it wasn't just the teenagers who wasted time and let things go, but all age groups.

However, some took advantage of their time and started getting more active and exercising, while some let their bodies go and were unmotivated to get out and do some physical activity. I found it interesting that even people at the age of atleast 65 let their phone usage go up, even if it was just a little day by day. I expected exercising in my age group to go down, but didn't realize by how much. In all the other groups, exercise went jup or stayed the same, showing older people made better use of their time during the pandemic than younger people did. Grossest part was to see how the pandemic demotivated people to shower, and this affected older people the most, as they had the highest average. The pandemic impacted our community greatly in all these ways, showing how we were all affected differently, and how it wasn't just the teenagers who wasted time and let things go, but all age groups.",

I'm guessing most people 15-24 are able to take more time to groom themselves now that there isn't as much pressure to be in a rush. As for how it relates to my community, I think it relates to my community because it gives me a general idea as to what people of different age groups do with time off of work and school during the pandemic.

We went from spending the second most time on our phones out of all the age groups to being the group who spent the most time on our phones. I also notice that the 15-24 year olds actually increased their grooming time by a little. I think this is because we spent the pandemic experimenting with the way we do our hair, how we dress, and the way we do our makeup. I wonder in the first graph why the 65+ group was using their cell phones to call and text more than the 15-24 age group when they are often the ones who say that we use our phones too much. This relates to me in the sense that most of the data for my age group accurately represents what happened with me. I started using my phone to text and call more, and I started to spend a little more time on my hair, makeup, and skin care. The middle graph however, is not accurate for me because the amount of exercise I get never changed. A good title for this graph would be the pandemic, where all of our screen time increased, people 25 and up started exercising more, and every generation except for Gen Z stopped caring about their looks.",

A catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea could be \u201cChanges in Human Behavior During the Covid-19 Pandemic.\u201d",

The first thing I noticed was that the graphs were separated into different colors which are 4 different age groups. \nYellow: 15-24, Orange: 25-44, Red: 45-64, and Purple 65+.\nThe youngest group definitely used their phones the most which, as a part of that category, I think is very accurate. Throughout the pandemic, It is shown that every age group. The amount of grooming in every age group except for the youngest Group went down throughout the pandemic, and the amount of exercising for every age group besides the youngest went up.\n2. I wonder, why only the younger group\u2019s exercising went down, and the grooming went up.  The pandemic made a lot of groups lazier, but some groups more productive.\n3. This relates to me because I lived through the pandemic, and I fit into one of these categories (The youngest one) For me personally, I fit into 2=1/3 results of my age group. I definitely used my phone a lot more during the pandemic. I couldn\u2019t go out and do anything, so I just went on my phone, and tiktok instead. I think I exercised much more during the pandemic than I did before. I went on a run almost every single day, because I had nothing else to do. I think the amount of grooming definitely went down for me. Some days I just wouldn\u2019t get out of bed- grossss I know.\n4. Quarantine?- More like  Quaran-Teens became more lazy.",

For all age groups time spent texting, phone calls, and videos calls increased. For ages 15-24 time spent exercising decreased by five minutes, but for the other groups it increased by 4 or 5 minutes. Grooming decreased for all groups except 15-24, which had a small increase. \n\n2. I wonder why the time spent texting and on phone and video calls is so low. From my experience and observation people spend much longer than 15 minutes a day texting or on calls. Maybe the number is so low because it only counts communication and not social media. I also wonder why ages 15-24 exercised less. Being at home more seems to have affected exercise time of very young people differently than everyone else, according to this graph. I also wonder why ages 15-24 spent slightly more time grooming. This could be because people those ages still had to be on video calls or even in person for school, so they still maintained their appearances.\n\n3. This impacts my community because the pandemic did affect how we spend our time. For my community the increase in time spent texting and on calls and decrease in time exercising generally applies. The almost no change in time spent grooming also makes sense because we still had to go to school.\n\n4. \u201cThe Pandemic Redistributes Our Free Time\u201d",

The youngest group uses their phone the most but the youngest group works the least out of all the age groups. I wonder why is that, why is the youngest group not exercising the most, they are the youngest they have the most energy, young bones, young legs but instead they would rather be on their phones. How does This relate to me? Because I am part of the young group, and I myself sometimes would rather not exercise and play on my phone. And i witnessed others do the same also, the older groups did not have the same technology we did so they are used to going outside, working out, and not picking up their phone because when they were kids they didn't have that.

I noticed that all other age groups except people from 15-24 started doing more physical activity. I noticed that people from 15-24 started grooming themselves more while the older age groups groomed themselves less. \n\nThe thing I am wondering is how come people started taking care of themselves less during 2020. For example people from ages 15-24 did less physical activity but groomed themselves more while the rest started doing more exercise and groomed themselves less. \n\nThis relates to me and my community because it shows how we started spending more and less time doing things such as being on our phones exercising and grooming ourselves which I believe is an accurate representation of how we live today.\nCOVID 19 AND ITS EFFECTS ON OTHERS",

I was surprised to see that for the 15-24 age group to have a decreased amount of exercise I really thought that most people in that age group increased their physical activities even if it was just a 20 minute run. I do feel like most people during the pandemic had some significant changes in their habits/hobbies and its a little complicated to narrow it all down to these 3 graphs but I overall think it did a good job.",

In this case texting, phone calls, and video chats have increased from 2019 to 2020 among all age groups included. Exercising has increased in all age groups included except for ages 15-24. Finally, grooming has decreased in all age groups except ages 15-24. \nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why the age group that consists of 15 to 24 year olds is not following the trends that the other age groups are following. Could it be that they are the youngest age group of the bunch? I wonder if the age group consisting of 15-24 year olds has an increased amount of time they spend getting ready because they have the free time to do so. Does it also have to do with social media and fashion trends? \nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nIt showed me that the pandemic allowed more free time for people to do what seems most important to them.

    "comment info": "Many of the trends shown in the graphs come as a result of quarantining, such as increased texting, calling, and video chats. My generation exercises less because we go outside much less and use technology more, whereas adults may exercise more because they have more free time and may not use technology recreationally (ie computer games). Grooming may have decreased for older generations because they work from home and have less of an incentive to maintain a good appearance, whereas younger generations may actually groom more because of interest in fashion trends and the influence of social media/the desire to show one's face on the internet. \n\nI do wonder how this data was collected, and for what purpose.\n\nInsofar as my demographic is represented in the graphs, this does relate to me.\n\nI cannot think of a catchy title.

For example, in the first graph, every age group increased in time spent on the phone because this was the only way to safely communicate during the start of the pandemic when it was most dangerous. I also notice that every age group except 15-24 increased time working out. Lastly, the 3rd graph shows that every graph except 15-24 spent less time grooming. This may be due to increased time on social media and devices which may have made some young adults more self-conscious of their appearances.\n2. I wonder why only the 15-24 age group exercised less. Perhaps because they were too used to gyms, which were closed at the time of the pandemic, as opposed to older age groups who may prefer less intensive exercises that can be accomplished at home.\n3. This data relates to me and my community because it shows that many people experienced similar things during the pandemic.\n4. \"Lifestyle changes before and during the pandemic show the effects of widespread technology\"",

Also, my age group has decreased in exercise whereas every other age group has increased in that area. Lastly, my age group was the only group to increase in grooming, which shows how we're dedicating more time to self-care, at least in that arena. \n\nWhat do you wonder? \n\nI wonder why my age group increased in grooming yet decreased in exercise, as self-care usually includes both grooming and exercise -- these two factors are usually linked. Furthermore, I wonder why other age groups decreased in grooming, perhaps because they had to work even more at home whereas school time is typically constant. \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community? \n\nIt's interesting to see how my age group, late teens and early adults, have an increased electronics use and on the whole, are dedicating less time to self-care despite the greater amount of free time due to less homework and fewer commitments (on average). Furthermore, I feel like other age groups are more readily able to purchase goods/services, which may have led to the increase in exercise (for instance, they can buy a Peloton bike) amongst other age groups. The changes in grooming amongst other groups make sense because they don't need to look as good for work at home, but grooming in our age group is still a mystery to me. \n\nCatchy headline: Gen Z is truly the digital generation.",

I wonder why haircuts decreased. I understand that exercising decreases with kids due to games and sports closing and increases with adults because maybe they want to work on their body more since they aren\u2019t doing anything else. It doesn\u2019t make sense why they would cut their hair less other than the fact that places were closed. The second graph relates to me because my water polo got shut down and I started exercising less until it started back up again.",

I also noticed, since our age group seems to spend the most time grooming ourselves, and since technology usage went up, there could be a correlation between the two, probably for social media appearance. I wonder why our age group spent less time exercising than in 2019, probably because gyms closed down and we weren\u2019t supposed to spend a lot of time outdoors. This relates to me and my age group because my age group\u2019s statistics seem to be pretty close to accurate, as I know I spent a lot of time on technology and less or the same time grooming myself when the pandemic began.

The largest increase was in the texting/phone calls/video chats in the 15-24, This might mean that teenagers could be impacted negatively in terms of mental health, however the texting graph only goes up to 15 minutes. Perhaps the increase looks more drastic and impactful, because the other two graphs go up to 45 minutes. I wonder how much an extra 8 minutes of screen time actually harms 15 to 24 year olds. Additionally, 15 to 24 year olds seem to have gotten less exercise during quarantine. Is this caused by increased screen time, or other unspecified factors.

For all age groups except 15-24, exercise increased likely due to an increase in free time. For teens and young adults, however, exercising decreased. I believe this is because the use of electronic communication increased drastically more than any other group and almost replaced exercising all together. Grooming decreased in every age group except for 15-24, which honestly surprised me and I'm curious as to why this is.

People in this comment section seem to think that 15-24 year olds increasing their time texting, using phone calls, and video calls, means increased time looking at social media. Although that could be true, the first graph mentions nothing about social media use increase. Beyond that people also seem to think that texting, phone calls, and video calls means increased phone usage. However, the graph is not looking at phone usage. Although phone calls do of course mean increased phone usage, this graph also looks at video chats and texting. Which is interesting, because video calls aren\u2019t even primary done on phones generally, rather they are usually done on computers. Of course texting is primarily done on phones, but we can\u2019t simply conclude that the extra time that 15-24 year olds spent on texting, phone calls, and video calls is only including these things on phones.",

In the last graph, the 15-24 group was an outlier again, being the only group that increased their grooming time. The three other groups decreased substantially more. It's clear that the 15-24 group had very different results compared to the older groups. I wonder why the 15-24 group decreased their exercise over the last year while the older groups increased. Another question that relates to exercising is why the 15-24 group groomed themselves more while the older groups groomed less. It's an odd mix of the amount of self-care, decreasing exercise while increasing their grooming. These graphs relate to me and my community because everyone around me, including myself, has changed over the last year because of the pandemic. Using technology to communicate increased for everyone due to clear reasons like social distancing and attempting to stop the spread of COVID. Self-care over the past year differs for everyone I know.

Those who are ages 18-24 spend more of their time grooming, while also spending less on exercising; this development is most likely due to them needing to sacrifice *some* time for other unmentioned jobs. However, the times people of ages 25+ spent on grooming and exercising have undergone the opposite effects respectively. This increase in exercising is most likely due to the elderly needing to keep in shape, and the fact that 25 is not an old age whatsover; this once again leads to some of their time needing to be sacrificed, and grooming seems to be one of them. \nTitle: \"The Permanent Effects of the Pandemic on our Leisure Time\"",

For example, in the first graph all of the age groups increased their time spent on their phones only by two to three minutes. Whereas the 15-24 age group increased their time spent on their phones by a whopping eight minutes. Although an increase in 8 minutes may not sound like much, comparatively speaking (with respect to the other age groups) it is a huge increase.  \n2) Throughout the pandemic, technology because everyone's primary source of communication, work, etc. - so it is not unexpected that there would be an increase across the board of technology use. However, since everyone was using technology for everything it seemed like, I wonder why only the one age group increased by such a great amount. \n3) The information relates to my community and me because, throughout the pandemic, I noticed myself going on my phone and computer much more than I would have if things were normal. However, I also noticed that my parents were doing the same as well. This causes me to think: \"If everyone was using technology for everything now, how is it that only my age group increased?\" After thinking about this question, the results made sense. Although it is a bad habit, I feel that my age group was more likely to go on their phones while we were in online school whereas our parents, were focused on their work. \n4) How Different Generations Spent Their Time Before vs After the Pandemic",

    "comment info": "1) From these graphs, I noticed that the 15-24 age group had an 8-minute increase in texting, phone call, and video chat usage, but a 5-minute decrease in exercising. The two could be correlated, as people could be spending more time on their electronics, and less time being physically active. However, it was honestly surprising to see a 0.4-minute increase in time spent grooming, which does make sense, considering the greater amount of time on our hands.\n2) Personally, I wonder why the 25-44, 45-64, and 65+ age groups experienced a pretty large decline in time spent grooming, but an increase in exercising. While grooming and exercising are both very necessary to personal health, I'd assume basic hygiene would be more of a priority.\n3) As a person who falls between the 15-24 age group, the statistics specific to my age group relate to my own experience during quarantine. Being a remote student last year, I definitely spent more time texting and calling my friends, since we couldn't interact in-person as frequently. It was also difficult to motivate myself to go on runs, as I would regularly do during track or cross-country in previous years, but I still tried to go on walks a few times a week.\n4) \"Daily Life During the Pandemic: A New Age of Habit\" - This headline refers to the various daily habits that have changed during the pandemic, with the relevant keywords \"age\" and \"habit\".",

For example, while phone usage has increased for all age groups, younger populations are being much more dramatically affected by the onset of the pandemic.\n\nThe difference is much more noticeable in the other two graphs; while older age groups are rising in exercise time and lowering time dedicated to grooming, younger populations are experiencing lower levels of exercising and higher levels of grooming.\n\nThe age group highlighted in yellow is mostly delegated to students in high school and college. Thus, there is a large factor that creates a pandemic experience dramatically different than adults.\n\nI wonder what pressures during the pandemic are being placed on students that compel them to overperform. They are spending more time glued to their phones and less time exercising. Moreover, an increase in grooming time implies that they are still expected to look fashionable to their online peers.

If anything, I would think that grooming would decrease, since classes were primarily virtual.\n\n3) Increased time on the Internet and exposures to all different types of content can be debilitating for many adolescents' upbringing.

As a 17 year old, I notice the changes in the 15-24 age group the most: increased time spent texting/calling/video chatting, decreased time exercising, and a slight change in time spent grooming (whereas the other age groups have spent much less time grooming). While the other three age groups tend to move in a similar fashion, 15-24 year olds seem to be a bit more \"independent\".\n\nI wonder how these statistics were gathered. What is the sample size and was the data collected from a representative population reflective of the country? Probably the most striking statistic is the increase in grooming time for 15-24 year olds, while an opposite change can be observed in the other age groups. Why is this? For the second graph, does the data take into account mandatory virtual PE classes?\n\nObviously, these statistics are very relevant to all people in the US, whose school and work have been affected by the pandemic. The first graph resonates well with my own personal experiences, as my friends and I have spent much more time video chatting compared to 2019.\n\nHeadline: Pandemic Highlights Striking Generational Divide",

In comparison, while older generations spent more time on electronics as well, their increase was significantly lower. They also tended to exercise more during the pandemic than ages 15-24.  Nobody cares about grooming, so we ignore the fact that the younger generation actually spent more time grooming themselves. \n\nScreen time went up significantly for my age range due to the focus on virtual schooling and assignments, and the primary way to connect with people was also mainly over our devices as opposed to hanging out irl. And naturally, given the opportunity, the younger generation defaulted to being lazier than before. : )",

Whether it was a phone call, zoom call, or social media, communication was the glue that held us together through this pandemic.

The exercise results vary; people of younger ages, 15-24, decreased their exercise whereas the adults, ages 45+ increased their exercise. For the most part, grooming decreased. I wonder if this is all due to the pandemic. I also wonder if students decreased their exercise due to mental health reasons and/or being outside of school, where there is no physical education provided to them. As for the older ages, I wonder if they exercised more because most were working from home and had more free time. I wonder if people exercised because they wanted to better themselves or maybe for weight loss. I wonder if the use of technology increased because most of the population had an increase in spare time and time spent at home. Finally, I wonder if the decrease in grooming occurred because there was an increase in isolation amongst the community. As previously stated, this all relates back to the community because, at the times of May through December 2020, a worldwide pandemic occurred where everyone was forced to quarantine.

The categories: texting, phone calls and video chats, exercising, and grooming. For the first category, every age groups minutes spent using their phone increased from 2019 until 2020, some as much as an 8 min increase. This can be attributed to one factor: COVID-19 pandemic. With kids and adults staying home all day, it's easier to find time to text, play games, etc. Also, without having the constant contact with peers in the workplace or school, people had to communicate through the internet with texting and calling. The next graph shows a decrease and increase in exercise from 2019 to 2020. The 15-24 year olds had a steady decline starting at 35 minutes of exercise a day, and ending with only 30. Given that with everyone being home you should have more free time, this statistic can only be attributed to the people actually wanting to exercise. Things like gym class and sports sort of forced exercise on this age category, and without it people chose not to exercise. The 25-44 and 65+ categories actually had a steady increase of 4 more minutes of exercise a day. The opposite occurred here, so when given more time, 25 to 65 year olds use it to exercise. The last statistic is a scary one...for since people were not leaving the house, it appears as if the time spent grooming was shortened entirely except for the 15-24 who barely spent more time.",

Looking at this graph, we can see that, as one might expect, all age groups began to use social media more between calling, texting, and video chatting with others. In contrast to this, however, we can see that for exercising, a necessary thing, most age groups began to exercise more, except for age group 15-24 who\u2019s overall exercise actually decreased. Finally, in direct opposition to the exercise amount, the 15-24 age group actually started grooming more while all other age groups groomed less.\n\nI do wonder if after the pandemic is over if these age groups will keep up their habits with this becoming the norm, if every age group will revert back to how much they were doing these activities before, or if the activity of each age group will change even more.\n\nThis relates to my community, and everyone\u2019s community, because people of these ages are around in every single community, everyone\u2019s community is changing with their activities, and now with activities changing it becomes a decision of do you want to change with your age group or will you make friends with other ages due to behaving more like them?\n\nThe graph shows the trends of activities between ages during the pandemic.\nActivities and ages, who's doing what, and how much are they doing them during the pandemic?",

In the first graph, I notice a large increase in phone calls and video chat, in the second graph I notice a good size decrease in exercise, and lastly in the 3rd graph I can see another decrease in grooming. The graphs include age groups and how many minutes these groups are typically spending per day. \n\n2) I wonder\u2026\nhow many people were surveyed \nwhen the survey took place\nhow accurate the survey is \nif a completely different set of people were to be asked the same questions, would the results be different? \n\n3) This relates to me and my community because I believe we can all relate to these different graphs.

It compares people from their old lifestyle before covid 19 pandemic and their new lifestyle. What surprises me about the graph the most is that younger people, ages 15-21, had spent more time grooming than they did in 2019. I  find that to be odd since a lot more people don't have to worry about how they look because of online learning.

Otherwise I was honestly moderately concerned because as of present day the easiest and main way of communication is through text, phone call, video chats, especially for family/ friends who were forced to live alone in isolation. I\u2019m surprised to say the least. For grooming (ages 15-25) why .4 of a minute? I really don\u2019t think that it makes a whole lot of sense, It very well might be a coincidence. That\u2019s an extra 25 seconds. That same graph also shows that the people on the older age groups time went down, I wonder why the youngest age group stayed up at almost normal levels while the rest declined drastically. Not to mention, the last graph omitted the baseline, why? It impacts me and my community because over the pandemic it shows how people in my age group (and others) spent their time over the pandemic. Otherwise I don\u2019t particularly agree with this graph. I personally spent a lot more time texting and such, more time exercising, and far less time \u2018grooming\u2019. An interesting title I thought of is: How age groups reacted to the excess amount of time over the pandemic",

This was shocking to me because I would think that middle-aged people would increase more than older people. It was very interesting to also see the decrease in exercise for the 15-24-year-old people and then an increase in exercise for everyone else. I wonder why the grooming category went down so much for 3 of the age groups. It is shocking to see how much quarantine affected people's everyday life. I think this graph is trying to point out the differences in people's lives after the pandemic hit. Personally, the pandemic had a huge effect on my motivation to be productive so I was on my phone a lot. The only thing that doesn't add up to me was the fact that I exercised more in quarantine than before and the graph shows a decrease in it. One thing that I am curious about is who contributed to the percentages. I know that random people did and not everyone experienced the same lifestyle in quarantine, but things were very different for me in quarantine than the others. In conclusion, this was a very interesting and informative graph that showed how different ages responded to the hit of the pandemic.

Do the graphs accurately display how these age groups spend their free time? If so, then this should impact the community as it shows that grooming and texting are a top priority on the things to do board when instead we can use that time socializing in person, or other various activities. I am curious as the correlation of the three graphs and how they connect, does spending more time texting and calling correlate with more time grooming and exercising? Or if it were also the other way, are those focusing on exercise more concerned with their grooming rather than texting or does it increase the likelihood that exercising and groom result in texting/calling.",

Looking at the color-coded lines and more specifically at the yellow one, we can see that there is an inverse relationship between the two graphs. \n\nI wonder what they mean by \"grooming\"\n\nI can relate to the age group 15-24 because I definitely find that the more time I spend on my phone, the less I felt inclined to exercise. \n\nin these figures, the amount of time spent on electronics has a significant impact on the amount of time spent exercising for the age group 15-24. The grooming time increased by 0.4 minutes but remained stable at 40 minutes, overall. In both graphs, the age range of 24-44 had a constant increase in technology usage, but grooming had a drastic fall. Similar results were seen in the age group, 45-64. \n\n\nA catchy headline: \"Interesting Effects of the Pandemic on Time Usage\"",

Phones are definitely at the top of the list probably for the obvious reason that it\u2019s just the easiest thing to do when you\u2019re bored.

    "comment info": "1. On these three graphs, I notice that as the time texting, phone calls and video chats increased, the time people spent \"Grooming\" was decreasing. If we look at the color coded lines, for yellow (age group 15-24), we can see that the time spent texting went up, and the time spent exercising went down. This is an inverse relationship. All the while, the time spent grooming stayed the same.\n2. I wonder what's considered \"Grooming\" for this study, and how they measure it.\n3. I can relate to the age group from 15 to 24. When I'm on my phone a lot, I have less time to exercise. I would say the time I spend exercising decrease for exponentially than in the graph provided. Other than that, its a carbon copy of what my community portrays. \n4. For these graphs, for the age group 15-24, at the time spent on electronics, it really affects the exercise time of this group. The grooming time had a slight increase of 0.4 minutes, but overall it stayed consistent with 40 minutes. The age group from 25 to 44 had a consistent increase in the first two graphs, (texting etc., and exercise) but had a dramatic decrease in time spent grooming. The age group from 45-64 almost replicated the age group from 25 to 44. The age of 65 and up also replicated those same patterns of 25 to 44, and 45 to 64, but more severely. I would say overall that \"Texting, phone calls and video chats\" affected this study greatly.\nHEADLINE: How Texting, Video Chats, and Phone Calls over the pandemic affected how we live.",

Texting  went up for everyone especially for ages 15-24 and grooming went up for ages 15-24 but went down for every other age group while exercising went down for the age group 15-24 while for people ages  45-64 and 65 and up exercise went up.\n\n2. Why didn\u2019t they take data about children under 15?\n\n3. It affects me and my community because if there is less exercise in the younger community then that could effect our whole evolution.
