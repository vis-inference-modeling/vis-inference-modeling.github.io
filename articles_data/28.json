Abortion, however, is a major reason why a lot of people aren\u2019t voting for Trump, which makes it the main reason they\u2019re voting for Harris.\nI wonder why supporters of one party care so much more about some issues than supporters of another party. And I wonder how Trump has convinced his supporters that immigration is the second biggest issue in the country\nThis relates to me because a lot of my most important issues line up with the most important issues of a lot of Harris supporters. The community i\u2019m in also cares a lot about abortion so the outcome of this election will have a major impact on members of my community even if i don\u2019t think it will affect me all that much.",

This is over double the percentage of the second most important issue, which is jobs/economy, at 13%.  For the Harris loyalists, there was not one issue that was significantly more important, the highest percentage being at the climate/environment at 16%, and the second most important being abortion and healthcare, tied at 14%.  Lastly, Trump's loyalists value the issue of inflation/prices the most, as 35% of his loyalists find it to be the most important.  Kamala Harris' supporters do not seem have a central issue that appears to be the most important, rather her supporters are spread out amongst a few issues.  This is different than both the swing voters and Trump's supporters because both are heavily interested/concerned with inflation/prices, being a significant amount of the voters.  I wonder why exactly Harris' supporters focus less on issues like inflation/prices and more about the climate, healthcare, and abortion.  I wonder if the swing voters will lean more towards Trump for the 2024 election because of their similar concerns with inflation.  This relates to me and my community because the adults in my life are voting in the 2024 election, and will have to decide what issues are most important to them in order to cast the vote that most accurately represents their political views.\nHeadline: \u201cThe 2024 Election: What Do Voters Value the Most?",

This overlap suggests that economic concerns dominate the minds of many voters, regardless of party affiliation.\n\n What do you wonder?\nI wonder how the results might shift if the poll included a larger and more diverse sample size. While 3% of registered voters participated is substantial, the potential for margin of error remains. A broader sample could provide deeper insights and possibly alter the overall trends.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis data has significant implications for me and my community since it remarks the favorability on certain socio political and economical priorities based on the election outcomes, which can led to the involvement of local discussions and actions among us, therefore influencing community initiatives (depending on who is elected and the issues they choose to address).Thus, by identifying these issues, a collaborative and supportive community can be formed in order to surpass the pressing challenges.",

There is also a large number of swing voters who believe it to be important, which could have a major impact on the election. If we're looking at the numbers, it would make sense that most of the swing voters are going to lean towards Trump. One of my questions when looking at this graph is why only 2% of Harris supporters believe immigration to be an issue. In my opinion, there are many problems with having ILLEGAL immigrants in our country that can cause our own citizens trouble. For instance the Laken Riley murder. Anyways, looking more locally here in Vermont, I would make the assumption that not too many people care about that and more about economy and abortion. Which I also care about and understand how many other people do.\nA good headline for this graph would be \"Most Americans; Trump Supporters, Harris Supporters, and Swing Voters; Care About Inflation and Prices\".",

Where the parties see somewhat eye-to-eye on this front, similarly prioritizing the subject, I also noticed how much they differed on other issues. The topic Harris loyalists care most about was recorded as the climate, with 16% of voters saying it was their most crucial issue, yet Trump supporters showed a complete 0% concern for this issue. I wonder why climate seems to be the issue with the biggest difference of opinion between the two parties, because it is actually a very pertinent and pressing concern. Swing voters only showed 5% support for this issue, so I wonder what is usually the tipping force for swing voters when they decide who to vote for. Is it based on a specific issue that is most important to them like the climate? Or do they base it on the candidates themselves?\nThis is important to my community because maybe when certain issues such as the climate become so significant to society that our politics/government are forced to correct them, the two sides could become more similar with time. If everyone's priorities were the same, we might begin to share the same thought processes and morals, and there would be more of a chance for the country to find peace.",

If we're looking at the numbers, it would make sense that most of the swing voters are going to lean towards Trump. One of my questions when looking at this graph is why only 2% of Harris supporters believe immigration to be an issue. In my opinion, there are many problems with having ILLEGAL immigrants in our country that can cause our own citizens trouble. For instance the Laken Riley murder. Anyways, looking more locally here in Vermont, I would make the assumption that not too many people care about that and more about economy and abortion.

The topic Harris loyalists care most about was recorded as the climate, with 16% of voters saying it was their most crucial issue, yet Trump supporters showed a complete 0% concern for this issue. I wonder why climate seems to be the issue with the biggest difference of opinion between the two parties, because it is actually a very pertinent and pressing concern.

How do these swing voters trends affect the polls every year?

The votes that are Republican in Lakewood have almost no sway when voting within the district because Lakewood is gerrymandered to be part of the city of Cleveland, so the 11th district will always be blue.",

But people think that they are polar opposites from each other.

Or perhaps it doesn't affect them too much. Also a follow-up for why immigration is so important to Trump Loyalist, is it a matter of security? Or taking away from jobs?\n3. In my community I feel like we want abortion rights and less inflation. So this is kind of the opposite of what Trump Loyalists are supporting (excluding the inflation of course), which is why I feel like my community tends to vote blue. \n4.

The groups portrayed are Swing voters, presumably people whose vote has an equal chance of going to Trump or Harris; Harris loyalists, who are unquestionably voting for Harris; and Trump loyalists, who are unquestionably voting for Trump. I noticed that the issues of inflation and immigration are heavily valued by Trump supporters. I assume that they are passionate about opposing the advancement of these topics. On the other hand, Harris supporters value health care, climate/environment, and Abortion. In these cases, they likely want to promote these topics. Swing voters seem to have closer values to Trump loyalists than Harris Loyalists. I'm surprised that guns aren't valued more.\n2. I wonder why this graph did not state if these voters were for or against these issues. How would this graph compare to one that detailed Biden loyalists instead of Harris loyalists? Why are civil rights and guns so undervalued by every group? Is it because people don't believe that they are being threatened? Do the interests of voters match the interests of their favored candidates?\n3.

Trump loyalists also care a lot about immigration, which is less of a priority for Harris loyalists and swing voters. Jobs and the economy are somewhat important for everyone, but each group has different top issues.\n\nWhat do I wonder?\nI wonder why inflation matters more to swing voters and Trump loyalists than to Harris loyalists.

These people are organized by who they are supporting as the presidential candidate or if they are swing voters. I noticed that inflation is commonly one of the most popular issues and that the amount of swing voters who find this to be most important is a little over the average of both Harris loyalists and Trump loyalists. I also noticed that inflation and immigration are prevalent issues with Trump loyalists and nothing else seems to reach that popularity. Meanwhile, the opinions on which issue is most important for Harris loyalists are scattered. I wonder what causes Harris supporters not to have a unanimous issue that is the most important. Maybe it is because a lot of the issues listed are thought to be \"liberal concerns,\" such as civil rights, climate change, abortion, and guns. While I am not eligible to vote, this still directly impacts me. Not only does the outcome of this election affect everyone in America, but these issues do as well. I think that most swing voters will end up voting for Trump. Regarding economic issues, Trump loyalists seem to be more concerned than Harris loyalists, and Swing voters are also more concerned.

Swing voters, Harris loyalists, and Trump loyalists'   different opinions on the most important issues are pictured. One thing I noticed is that most trump loyalists and swing voters care more about inflation/prices than anything else. However, only 13% of Harris loyalists care about inflation/prices. One thing  I wonder about is why Harris loyalists don't have one specific issue that they care about significantly more than the others. Climate change is the most, however, healthcare is only 2% below it. Their opinions are pretty split up. I'm also curious about why immigration is at 2% for Harris loyalists because one would think that they would want to fight more for immigrants to stay in our country and have refuge.

Are there demographics or local issues influencing these concerns? How can candidates effectively address these varied priorities to connect with voters?\n\nCommunity Connection: Understanding these key issues is crucial as the election approaches. Addressing inflation and healthcare could resonate widely, especially with swing voters who may determine the outcome. Engaging in local discussions around these topics can foster greater voter participation.\n\nChallenge of the Day: Given that inflation is a top concern for both groups, it could sway swing voters. If Trump addresses economic issues effectively, he may attract them. Conversely, if Harris focuses on healthcare and social issues that resonate with swing voters, she could gain their support. The election outcome will depend on which candidate articulates better solutions to these key issues. If the economy dominates, it might favor Trump; if healthcare and social justice take precedence, Harris could have the upper hand.\n\nCatchy Headline: \"2024 Election Showdown: A Spectrum of Key Issues at Play\"",

I also notice that swing voters rank issues by importance in the middle of republican and democratic voters for almost all issues. I also notice that inflation/prices is a major issue for Harris loyalists, Trump loyalists, and swing voters. I wonder why both Harris loyalists and Trump loyalists have such low ranking of importance for very obvious important issues. For example, Trump loyalists care 0% about climate change, which is obviously affecting our country severely, especially looking at the rise in hurricanes. Also, Harris loyalists only care 2% about immigration, which is another issue severely affecting our country and bringing about a lot of issues. I think what is going on in this graph is that it is serving as a guide for the upcoming election. This graph shows what issues are mainly important to each party. This graph relates to me and my community because election day is very close. I cannot vote yet, but my family can, and whoever becomes president affects my life as well.

    "comment info": "1. I notice that the outlined groups tend to support issues that align with their political views and ideologies. For example, swing voters voted that the most pressing issue is inflation/prices, reflecting the neutral views of most middle-class Americans and those undecided as to the nominee they will support. Harris supporters voted that the most pressing issue is climate change, aligning with democratic party values and those values associated with Harris and her campaign. On the other end of the spectrum, Trump supporters voted that the most pressing issues are inflation/prices and immigration, values traditionally associated with the Republican party and views that Trump aligns himself with.\n2. Seeing that the Harris and Trump graphs are based off the first graph (in which swing voters\u2019 opinions are organized from most voted for to least voted for), I wonder what the remaining two graphs would look like if the issues were organized my most relevant to either Harris or Trump supporters. This could make one see how Americans' views are different when seen in reference to a liberal or more conservative viewpoint as the baseline.\n3. I am voting this year for the first time and that all of the issues listed are important issues of both sides\u2019 campaigns. By studying and learning the context of visuals such as these, I can try to become more educated as a voter and work to understand the two viewpoints of the presidential candidates in order to decide which I am to vote for.",

Though I think swing voters are about in the middle between Harris and Trump loyalist percentages for every issue. Therefore, swing voters don't have an especially low percentage for civil rights, as they are about in the middle of Trump and Harris loyalist percentages. I think the reason for Trump loyalists having such a low percentage for civil rights and abortion is because those issues don't affect the type of people loyal to Trump. Trump voters tend to be more cisgender male religious people rather than Harris loyalists. Sexual freedom and abortion rights do not directly affect the majority of cisgender men. Also, Christians tend to not find abortions morrally right and would not get one. Therefore, Trump voters are less personally affected by civil rights and abortions, which is why their importance is ranked so low.",

I also wonder what exactly is the number of voters chosen to answer for what they deem to be most important.  Lastly, I wonder if there is any chance that the loyalists could at any moment become swing voters, making their response void?\n\n3) This relates to me and my community because it places into perspective exactly what the people of each party want from their candidates.  And what they deem to be most important.  It also gives some insight into what the swing voters want, which seems to be a mix of what the loyalists think is most important.\n\n4) The Wants of the Voters: From Trumpers, to Harris, to the Undecided",

Trump supporters, on the other hand, are more concerned with immigration and inflation. Health care and climate change are more important to Harris supporters. In reality, every group has distinct goals, particularly in relation to finances or occasionally social issues. \n\n2) I wonder how the election winner will be impacted by these challenges. I do believe that the Swing voters will support Harris, but I also feel that it really comes down to what people want for their country. Donald Trump's contributions to our nation have already been witnessed, and some individuals were not pleased. I believe that the Trump fans will vote for Trump once more, while the Joe Biden supporters will vote for Harris. \n\n3) This is relevant to me and my town because, despite Perth Amboy's diversity, not everyone has equal possibilities. Many residents are obsessed with their employment and the real economy. I instantly considered how my community may vote on these issues when I saw the terms \"jobs/economy\" and \"healthcare\" in this graph.  \n\n4) It's The Money That Speaks To Us!!
