The difference is that there are differences between the level of decrement in labor force over time. Even though the labor force participation is generally going down, some of the nations' are recovering from a significant drop, like, Britain! Even Japan's LFPR has increased for certain period. However, if you look at the way how the USA's LFPR is going downward, you will easily find out that the  LFPR of the US is not capable of reviving after major declines.

I would attribute this to the diminishing influence of gender roles since the 80's. Women's increased involvement in the work force has reduced the availability of jobs for men, who previously dominated most working positions.\n\nThe most significant decrease is in the United States. This could be attributed, also, to issues of unemployment that have been prevalent in our nation. While the graph is inclusive of men actively seeking work, discouragement or difficulty finding feasible, well-paid, hiring positions as a result of increased competition could attribute to this decrease. Issues of retirement could also explain this decrease, as much of the baby-boomer generation is exiting the work force. \n\nI wonder why the labor-force participation in Japan is significantly higher than that of in other countries. I read an article last year that explained Japan's issues of aging population; they have a large population of people over 60, or retirement age, that are refusing to retire and remain in the workforce. This is why much of the younger generation, recent graduates, are failing to find positions in the workforce. I wonder if this information impacts Japan's male employment.",

In some countries such as France and Denmark, there are large peaks that suggest a fluctuation of labor-force participation throughout the years.\nI wonder why Japan has remained the country with the highest labor-force participation rate, with a more stable rate throughout the year, contrasting with the United States, who has remained the country with the lowest labor-force participation and dropped 6%. Could this be due to Japan's more stable economy and creation of jobs and the United States' lack of either? Why was there an increase in labor-force participation around 2008 for Denmark, Canada, and the United States?\nThe story the graph is telling is that in these powerful countries, the desire to be employed or the ability to be employed has decreased. It could be due to the increasing global population that makes jobs harder to find and does not accommodate.",

Finally, I noticed that the United States has the lowest labor-force participation rate of all the selected O.E.C.D. countries by far. I wonder if the percentages of these countries could have something to do with cultural differences in perspectives of job importance or the availability of jobs within the specified country. However, to answer the question \"What's going on in this graph?,\" I believe that this graph is trying to convey the importance of the significant difference in labor-force participation rate that the United States (since the U.S. has a bold black line whereas the other counties have much softer colored lines) has from the rest of the selected O.E.C.D. countries.",

The greater part of the nations in this investigation have had a diminishing rate of support in the work constrain in the course of recent years, some more than others, for example, the United States, and some short of what others, for example, Germany (or whatever nation the yellow line is, I can't tell). What I ponder while taking a gander at this diagram is the thing that happened in each of the nations to influence their work to constrain support rate go down. Likewise, the glossary expresses that work cooperation rate is the percent of the populace that is working or currently looking for work. I don't know how they accumulated this data or on the off chance that it was through an overview, however I realize that if jobless individuals are inquired as to whether they are jobless, they would rather say they are \"searching for work\" than conceding they are not working. This may deliver predisposition relying upon how the data was assembled.",

This may imply that men are having difficulties in trying to get jobs or imply issues with our education system (the cost of going to college, etc.) I also notice that the sharpest decline for the United States on the graph occurred when the recession of 2008 hit, which makes sense. \n\nI wonder why  Japan has such a consistently high labor force rate compared to all other countries- even countries with traditionally very high qualities of life, like Denmark. I also wonder why the United States experienced another drop from around 2010-2015, and then why we are experiencing growth again. Some research could provide me with these answers. \n\nThe deeper story behind this graph is that the United States is behind other developed countries in the percentage of men who are either working or actively seeking work, despite all of the countries in the graph being part of the Organisation for economic cooperation and development, which is supposed to promote sustainable economic growth by sharing strategies. For some reason, the United States doesn\u2019t seem to be implementing these strategies.",

In addition, I can see that most countries including US has begin to see a rise in labor force participation once again. I wonder what has caused this rise in economic productivity.

But hold on...\n\nLet's wonder about:\n1) Why these 7 countries are presented here? Highest participation in 80' or what? (rather not exactly - no Korea, Sweden, Spain or Australia, if I checked OECD source correctly) By the way, why do the time series start from 1980?\n2) Why Y axis minimum is set to 87% and makes US change horribly drastic? Is 88% a reason to really worry about?\n3) What is an exact definition of \"working\" etc (e.g. 2 hours every week counts?) and is it comparable across different countries / in one country in time (almost 40 years of stats are included here)?\n4) Why men 25-54? + What is retirement age in selected countries? Curious to see trends for woman as well (checked them, interesting indeed)\n5) Why the trend is negative in general? Common hidden process? This question leads to a storytelling part.\n\nSuppose my methodology worries were unjustified and everything is perfect.  Less % of people are working!

I wonder what other confounding factors affect the data from this representation, such as recessions or times of war. Although there is a general negative correlation for all countries, they all experience up-and-down movement, which could relate to the country's economic status in recession or recovery. With these things in mind, this graph seems to show the resilience of each country's workforce in putting people into work as others leave, retire, or die.

It depicts an average downward trend across different countries, with the United State's decline being the most prevalent. I think this is due to the fact that there are more job opportunities for men in the United States that don't consist of manual labor.  We offer jobs in tech industries, offices, and other things that perhaps aren't offered at a wide rate in other countries, such as Japan. I do wonder why japan has the highest rate, one that's way above all of the other countries. I don't believe that the decline in the labor force within the United States is a bad thing, our economic situation isn't exactly in despair currently.",

I figured that out by looking at the chart\u2019s key. I also noticed that the amount of years this graph covers is around 2016 and could be specifically pointing out the United States. I say this because the only one in bold is the US line and name, and that the US\u2019s line is actually slowly rising after 2015. I wonder if the reason why all the lines going down mean that less men are working because less jobs being available or more people are taking up using government aid like unemployment. I also wonder why Japan has the highest job rate than any other country. The story this graph is telling us is that as the years go on, the countries in this graph will keep going down because of the economic stability and less available jobs. It helps show how the economy is affected when less people are working and records when the economy is rising and falling throughout  the years.",

Now in 2017, you see people making YouTube videos as a job, selling items of their own, or not even working. Technology has advanced so much throughout the years and now it's technology that is doing all the work for us. Surprisingly, the U.S. has the highest decrease in labor-force and I don't know if that's a good or bad thing. Japan is the lowest decrease and I don't know if that's a good or bad thing either.

Japan has and always had the highest percentage of people in the labor force, US currently has the lowest. I think the graph tells the story of the different cultures of different countries. Speaking generally, the school leaving age has increased. Now, people need to get more amount of education to get a sufficiently paying job than before. Since the graph illustrates the participation rate of only men, it can also tell us something about the change in people's attitudes about gender roles. A greater number of women are now a part of the labor force and more men are taking up responsibilities traditionally deemed as those of women (stay at home dads, for example). The economic development in the countries is very high, therefore I don't think that the declining labor force participation rate is necessarily a problem, in fact the countries may be heading in the right direction with the change in attitudes. \n\nI do wonder why Japan has the highest rate and if it is a good thing. Japan has a lower women's labor force participation rate than the United States as of 2016, and this may call for a change. Also, the sharp plummet and the following increase in Germany participation rate may tell an interesting story.",

The overall pattern of the graph shows the participation rate in the past thirty-seven years for all the European countries have declined. For Japan, its participation rate has always been above ninety-five percent, but the percentage is still declining. For the United States, the participation rate drops to lower than ninety percent in around 2007, and it never reaches ninety percent again. I  wonder how the participation rate dropping will affect the economy in every country. I also wonder that does O.E.C.D mean. The story this graph is telling is the Labor force participation rates around several developed countries have dropped in the past thirty-seven year, indicating the declining interest for adult males to have a job or trying to find one. This might represent the decline in global economy because the unemployment rate is rising. However, the differences in participation rate can also be affected by the different population composition. For example, Japan has a serious aging population problem. The proportion of people aged from 25 to 54 in the country is decreasing, which might be the reason for it to have a higher Labor force participation rate.",

    "comment info": "It seems we were all disappointed that the U. S. fell so far behind the other countries in labor-force participation rate, especially behind Japan.  We also puzzled at why for most of 1980 - 2017, the rate was declining for all countries.  The reasons most frequently mentioned were technology replacing workers, women working rather than men, and Americans not as motivated to work.  Some said that jobs have been lost to other countries and Americans are staying in school longer.  The graph shows where the data came from:  Alan Kreuger of Princeton University.  Google this and see if you can find what factors Kreuger thinks have most affected the U. S. labor-force participation rate.  Cameron Croom of Raleigh, NC was the first one to hit this reason on the head.\n\nSince we continue to post responses, whenever they arrive, are there more that you notice?  More that you wonder?  Talk to your classmates and even read the moderators\u2019 responses.  Maybe something they say will lead to more things you notice, wonder, and conjecture.  Probe whether the conjectures are possibly true, and if not, change your conjecture.   \n\nRemember to check back on Friday, November 17 to learn more about this graph -- and we hope to see you again next month on Tuesday, December 12 (always the second Tuesday of the month) for our next \"What's Going On In This Graph?\" \u2028\u2028Signing off now -- Sharon in Boston and Erica in Pittsburgh.

Since all of these are considered developed countries, the work force is bound to decrease and this trend in the graph is expected. \n\nOne of the things that I am wondering about is the sharp drop of labor-force participation for Great Britain in 1990. This might be due to the economic cycle being at a trough, because the labor-force rate jumped back up in 1991. I believe it is probably due to cyclical unemployment. Also, I am not that shocked by Japan's high percentage of their labor force. Japanese culture values work highly and anyone unemployed is looked down on, even for women.",

I also wonder what 'nudges' we might consider in this country to spur a higher fraction of male work engagement.\n** The graph tells the story of a slow decline in the fraction of men working, and of the progressive decline of the US in this facet. It does not tell the story of female work engagement, or of that for older workers. Thank you for this graph, and for this forum in which to learn!",

I notice that the United States has the slowest economic growth out of all of the countries on the graph. This may because of the poverty and the unemployment currently in the United States that may be influenced by the President of the United States. I also notice that every countries over time are having a decreasing economic growth.\n\nI wonder first what exactly is the definition of economic growth in a country and how exactly it is calculated. I also wonder why the labor-force participation rate of all countries are steeply calculated. It may be because of NATO, the UN, and other government policies that include some aspect of the economy.\n\nThe story of the graph tells us that the economic growth between the years of 1980 and 2017. The graph is implying that the unemployment rate around the whole is steeply decreasing. In addition, the graph only shows selected OECD countries. This also implies that the graph has bias and maybe has left out countries that may have had a labor-force participation rate increase. \n\nSo in summary, countries must make better policy in and outside of their countries in order to have a labor-force participation rate increase.",

Societally, there's more wiggle room for men to become stay at home dads, caretakers, etc. rather than immediately joining the work force. Fathers taking care of their children and allowing the other spouse to work are becoming much more socially acceptable. Also, in recent years, the education system (at least in the United States) has began heavily pushing for each and every student to go on to a four year college, no matter how much debt you may collect. Thus, causing many to leave high school just to go onto four or more years of further schooling, stunting the amounts of young adults joining the workforce. Nonetheless, we must continue to stay determined to further our education and aim to contribute the most we can to our country's workforce.",

I wonder if the cause of this decline could be the expansion of technology and how the countries might need less men to do more labor-enforced jobs rather than as before. The story this graph is telling me how the decline of labor-forced participation for men age 25-54 could contribute to other inventions that could help decrease the number of enforced labor for men.",

Is it possibly that certain males are choosing to stay at home and be stay at home fathers? Or is the competition for jobs so bad it is putting so many American males out of work?

I wonder if this is due to the increased amount of technology taking jobs away from humans. It could also be because it's becoming more socially acceptable in the United States for men to become stay at home Dads.",

In my opinion, this shows how the decrease in young men working is due to culture and economic change. In America, more women are working, as women enter the work force, men leave it, as the work force moves over seas, America has less available jobs and as American youth are coddled, they are less willing to work.",
