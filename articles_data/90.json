The purpose of this graph is to show how the Russian invasion of Ukraine is affecting the people of the country, with over 2.8 million of them fleeing the country from February 24 to March 13. One thing I wonder is what caused almost 3 million people to become refugees from Venezuela from 2017 to 2018, which is the greatest increase in refugees in this graph. Another thing I wonder is how many Ukrainian refugees there are now, two months later, and if it has increased or decreased.

This demonstrates the extent to which the Russian-Ukraine conflict is affecting the Ukrainian people. The fact that over 2 million people have fled Ukraine in less than a month is terrifying because it demonstrates the actual fear that has been placed on their lives in recent weeks. I'm curious what the statistics in Ukraine will be in another month, and then when the war is ended. I also noted that about 3 million individuals evacuated Venezuela in 2017-18, which is quite recent, and I'm curious why. I would title this graph \" The Effect of the Ukraine War on Refugees\"",

I also notice that Ukraine is the most recent count while Ethiopia goes back to 1979 to 1980. Each time the refugee count increased in these one-year terms, a crisis has occurred in the country most likely due to war, persecution, natural disaster, or dictatorship. When looking at the lower map, I notice that most Ukrainian refugees went to Poland. This could be because their languages are similar, making it easier to communicate, and their past history together as one Republic. I wonder why people chose to go to Russia since their country is being attacked clearly by Russia specifically. It is so far out of the way compared to other countries, making it even more difficult to reach.

We can see that countries like Hungary and Slovakia host the next highest number of refugees. We can also see around 130,000 refugees have fled to Russia.

I was completely shocked to find out that Ukraine's refugee rate almost surpassed Venezuela's rate in a matter of 3 weeks. This is so crazy to me because I can only imagine how many more people will come, considering that this is only the start of the crisis. I also noticed that the biggest circles with amounts of refugees were countries that faced extremely large conflicts, such as Afghanistan and its recent wars. I wonder how many more refugees will flee Ukraine and how much higher the rates will go up. When looking at the second graph, I noticed that majority of the Ukrainian refugees were going to Poland. I wonder if this is because Poland is the closest, involved in NATO, and has nuclear power. I also wonder how any Ukrainians Poland is willing to accept. They have already excepted over a million new residents into their country. This relates to me and my community because the US is directly involved in helping to aid Ukraine and this war is still currently going on.

Ultimately, Ukraine has more refugees, you might say, \"No it doesn't Venezuela obviously has more.\" But if you look at the date Venezuela's refugees is over the course of a year while Ukraine is only under ONE MONTH! Overall, in the future if the amount of Refugees coming from Ukraine stays the same it will over throw Venezuela (My estimate but the end of April there will be about +3.6 million refugees).

As can be seen, the time periods used for all countries except for Ukraine is one year. The circle that illustrates the number of Ukranian refugees is coloured purple, while the others are grey, which makes it stand out from the rest. By making it colourful, the author attracts viewer\u00b4s attention to it. What else can be seen is that although the time period given in which Ukrainian refugees had to flee the country is only 17 days, the number of the refugees is the second highest from all the countries mentioned. This shows how big of a crisis this actually is as it is escalating unbelievebly quickly.",

I think that there is multiple longterm effects, for younger generations such as Gen Z, the Ukrainian war is one of the first major world political events we have been aware of being raised in a post 9/11 world/country which can shift our political views and views of the world in general as we discover who we are and our ideological beliefs.

Virtually all of the other countries' neighbors were less than willing to accept refugees. Especially since their countries were much better\n\nIf Ukraine's neighbors are part of the reason why there are so many refugees? Because Poland and Romania seem a lot more helpful to their neighbor Ukraine than Congo and Burundi were to Rwanda.\n\nI wonder if there is going to be another immigration crisis in our cities, if we're going to send these Ukrainians to their respective ethnic neighborhoods that already existed like Brighton Beach and Forest Hills, or if we're going to build them new neighborhoods and public housing like Minneapolis did for Somalis? Is there going to be a crime increase? A Poverty increase? Is the government going to prioritize Ukrainian refugees over other demographics?\n\nUkrainian Refugee Crisis; Scaled and Compared",

The rapid growth of refugees within a month indicates that many of them may travel out of Ukraine when possible, and perhaps to The United States.

As someone who is an immigrant from Venezuela, I understand the pains that Ukrainians are going through right now. I would expect many more Ukrainians registering for school whether that is in FL or anywhere in the US.
