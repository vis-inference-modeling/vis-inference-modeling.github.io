So, if reading Netflix's is hard, it should take more time to read than Reddit given the fact that both of them have same reading minutes.",

It also makes sense why rarely anyone sits and reads these policies if they have to spend and average of 10 to 30+ minutes. Most teens I know wouldn\u2019t spend even 5-10 minutes reading these policies just assuming it tell how their privacy is protected. Which they think they already know and, some just don\u2019t care.

I\u2019ve noticed that most big corporations use difficult language at a professional level in their policies. I\u2019ve also noticed that most of these companies have policies that take 20-40 minutes to read.  This is because the high reading level makes it difficult for people to understand the policies, so it takes them longer to read. I wonder how they collected this information? Were people asked to read these policies for an experiment, and if so, how many people were taken into account ? I\u2019ve also noticed that the books that were compared to these policies are usually books that are taught in high school. Most of these books are old, so the diction is very difficult, and most people struggle to comprehend these books . However, this graph shows that these texts were easier to read than most of the privacy policies for big companies. So, I think  this graph is attempting to convey the message that big corporations use difficult diction in their policies to scam people into quickly subscribing or using their website/app. Most people will tend to quickly skim over the policies, due to the difficult language, because it\u2019s not likely they would spend 20-40 minutes reading and comprehending this information.

I wonder why Disney is higher up in reading ability when usually it\u2019s demographic is leaned towards children and families. Disney is a huge corporation that can easily sneak a loop into the privacy policy because kids don\u2019t have that higher reading ability and most parents trust Disney. I\u2019ve noticed how social media like Snapchat, Facebook, and Reddit are all around a high school reading level most likely because that\u2019s what their main target audience is. I wonder if this difference between companies is linked to how trustworthy they are. Like a more comprehensive reading level and lower time to read is more trustworthy compared to another company with a higher reading level and a higher time to read.",

The x axis illustrates how long it takes to read each policy. From this information I wonder why most college level polices are able to be read in a shorter amount of time. From this graph I inferred that the website\u2019s privacy policy correlates with its intended consumer market. That being said more e-commerce based sites have more difficult and time consuming policies because the consumers are capable of reading at a high level. However, sites more often used by everyday people such as Netflix and Amazon have lower reading levels and less time is estimated to read these policies. This is because the age and educational background of people who use these sites is not as experienced as the e-commerce consumer base market.

Something that I am curious about is why Amazon does not have a long privacy policy even though it is a huge corporation. Based on the graph I can infer that apps used by a younger audience have longer privacy policies.

Not only is important to consider how prevalent under-aged child controversies are, but it is also important to consider how much Snapchat allows us to store personal conversations and images. Since the privacy policies are so complex to read and are often ignored by users, Snapchat is making it possible for these users' information to be exposed, some of that information being extremely inappropriate and personal. Although it is not a good thing, nude pictures are commonly exchanged on Snapchat. If these images were to be shared, legal issues such as child pornography could occur.",

It ranged from books, to social media sites, to news websites. The reading level of the privacy policies vary and so does the time of reading them. The wonders of the graph are how it\u2019s arranged. Why is it that Walt Disney is so much harder to read then Snapchat privacy policies? Isn\u2019t Walt Disney for children and Snapchat for teenagers? It should be very close in range of reading levels. The reasons Walt Disney is a harder reading level is because it has more regulation and information that needs to be read for its website. It\u2019s such a big network and has more complex terms then Snapchat would. That\u2019s why it\u2019s categorized into the Professional Career section rather then high schools reading level, like Snapchat is.

The first thing I noticed was that many social media pages share similar reading levels, though some take longer to read than others. The next thing I noticed was that larger companies or news sites typically had a much higher readability score than the rest of the graph, yet remained in a medium area for how much time it took to read. There are also popular novels in more faded texts, likely placed to help guide a viewers understanding of the difficulty of each policy. I do wonder what the other smaller dots are meant to represent, although I am guessing that they are smaller name companies or apps. I believe that the deeper story within this graph is to show how the larger companies typically use more confusing or higher level writing, which may confuse or put off the reader from completely analyzing the policies, as shown in larger companies like GoDaddy, Walt Disney, CNN, and CNS Sports. Their reading levels are higher yet time taken to read is low, likely due to readers skimming long privacy policies instead of taking the time to struggle through the more difficult writing. Whether intentional or not, these companies show an odd ratio between difficulty and time taken to read, while social media companies like Snapchat and Reddit maintain a medium difficulty with a medium time taken to read.",

But those sources are all in a window of time I takes to read, majority of them are in the 10-25 minute range, few take longer than 25 or shorter than 10. So the attention span of the reader dictates the length of the article. I wonder why social media platforms such as Snapchat, reddit, and Facebook focus on a high school and above audience, when most kids are downloading such apps at a youthful age. Why not gear the apps to best fit the audience? Social media is used by the youth, no as much by the middle age and the elederly. And the youth have a high school if not lower reading ability. I can infer that there exists a sweet spot from the sources difficult to the sources length. That sweet spot appears to be at a collegiate reading level with a source that ranges from about 10-20 minutes in reading length. the sources are intentionally doing that to maintain a professional read that is still readable in short period of time. This difference shouldn\u2019t discriminate those without the abilities. The opportunities to read and enjoy those sources should be available to all reading abilities and not just the select few. So I belive the point of the graph was to show lack of unity in sources, and how there is a lack of sources that everyone can enjoy.",

For example, the graph shows that professional levels read about Walt Disney along with CBS Sports, therefore one can infer that it seems professionals want to learn more about the interests of common young adults in school who maybe enjoy sports. Digging on a deeper level could younger teens in high school want to read certain books that were created  in a earlier time? A thought for this would be that maybe teens in high school read Harry Potter  not only to just read the books but to connect to the professional level adults who grew up on the series themselves reading these books while in high school. Another example is BBC a news site that many adults tune in, which seems interesting that teens are taking interest in the site. One could believe that professional adults are trying to learn more about teens today to understand and connect but as on the contrary teens today try reading certain sources to connect to adults today and understand what professional adults grew up on.",

Many of these companies even require a college level reading skill, which many around the world do not have. This may be to keep the policy somewhat obscure. Are these companies attempting to shelter the content of their policies in order to publish information without the customer realizing? This would especially make sense for the companies that are involved with social media (snapchat, facebook, reddit, etc) due to the fact that their audience is mainly teenagers. More often than not, a high school teenager does not possess a reading level great enough to be able to read above a college level, let alone at professional level. This brings me to wonder, if anything, what are these companies hiding? And why are the novels that are being compared only judged to an extent of the first chapter?",

More social networking and entertainment companies seem to have policies that are fairly easy reads, while news companies or companies that provide a service have longer or more complex privacy policies. I\u2019m assuming the discrepancies between a few similar companies reading level and length deal with viewer demographics. BBC\u2019s target audience is adults around the age of 35, while 39% of CNN\u2019s audience is over 65. BBC has a policy reads around the same difficulty as Harry Potter and The Sorcerer\u2019s Stone while CNN reads around 1600 difficulty.

I believe that the time taken to read has less so do with the reading level because people can understand the gist of the privacy policy without needing over 20 minutes to read it. The time is more related to a persons curiosity of the rules  and rights, another possible factor is when money is involved the person is more likely to want to know what they are getting into beforehand. For example an Airbnb takes the most time to read because you are investing your own money into it, and a person is probably more curious about the rules of an Airbnb because it is another persons property.",

I wonder how much or the privacy policies are being read compared to reading the first chapter of a book, how many pages? I also wonder why websites write their privacy policies so difficult, to make reading them dreadfully impossible for the a average American. I wonder if they are trying to hide something deep into the pages so no one finds it.

Another observation I made was that a majority of the popular texts had a lower reading level than most company privacy policies. This makes it difficult for users to read and understand the policies as they are not used to reading difficult texts, making them unaware of risks involved in using the software.

I believe such to be true as BBC\u2019s data point is an outlier in the data set. It takes around 13 minutes to read and has a Lexile score of about 970, which when compared to other apps like Baidu which has a Lexile score of above 1600 and takes 10 minutes to read, makes me wonder what is so different about the terminology and vocabulary used in the privacy policies. I also saw that BBC's data point is different compared to other news station such as CBS Sports and CNN, thus again making me wonder what is so different about the content of the privacy policies that makes the lexile level and time to read higher. I also noticed that political media channels like CNN have a higher Lexile level of around 1600 compared to apps like Vimeo and Snapchat that only have a Lexile level of about 1100 and 1200 respectively. This makes me wonder whether or not the content being displayed and used in CNN is more advanced and requires more outside knowledge than apps like Snapchat and Vimeo do. Overall this graph shows that most social media apps like Reddit, Facebook, and Snapchat that are tailored towards younger audiences have a lower Lexile level and reading time compared to news and media apps like CNN and Airbnb. I would name this graph, \"No Wonder We Don't Read These Things.\"",

When looking at their competitors you can see that other news stations such as CNN are on the complete opposite side of the spectrum. Is BBC just trying to maintain a reliable and understandable private policy or are bigger companies like CNN and N.Y.T are trying to fool consumers. When researching the topic, the N.Y.T says BBC uses plain sentences to show the consumer their right to use their data and when they will ask for the permission to use their data. This allows for the consumer to clearly see their rights to their personal data; other companies purposely make it hard for consumers to understand the agreement and make it harder for the consumer to file for a law-suit for improper use of their data, but sadly the high readability score caused them to not full understand the agreement. \n2-My next question is why Walt Disney readability score is so high when their main demographic is targeted to young children. If children are using Walt Disney products how are they to be accountable for understanding such a complex private policy. On Disney product is specifically says 3 and up. meaning that their apps and products are for a young demographic. If its for such a young demographic why is it so hard to understand? Is Disney trying to hide something?\n3- Finally, popular apps among young adults have the readability score between high school and college. They are readable for the correct demographic.",

Other companies that score higher readability are often news channels that use higher vocabulary to convey information targeted for people who have higher attention spans and are willing to weigh in on national issues.

Something that interests me the most is the fact that Walt Disney is considered a professional career reading level. I notice that most of these privacy policies are centered in around 10 to 20 minutes to read. I wonder why do most people skip the privacy policy and why most of these websites in college-level reading. I wonder how hard are they making the privacy policy to read or are they writing to the targeted audience. For example, for Snapchat are they targeting their app to highschool people and is Yahoo targeted to students who are in college. Is this way people usually skip privacy policies because they can't read it because it is too hard for people who are not a targeted audience too read it.

    "comment info": "When I look at this graph, I immediately notice that one of the highest readability privacy policies is for CNN. As displayed on the right side of the graph, CNN is depicted as having a professional career reading level. It also has a somewhat mild reading time. This gives me the idea that higher-level media are more viewed by higher leveled readers due to the fact that it may be more appealing to them. I then look over to things like Snapchat and Reddit and see that they are at a lower reading score. Things like these are commonly seen in use by children and or teens. They also have lower reading times making me think that depending upon the reading material or category of these media, the details in privacy policies change. For example, the app Airbnb has the highest reading time of all data displayed. This may be because of the realm of appeal this app is in is more complex. Airbnb is a system used to book hotel stays. This means that more complex applications like these have more conditional statements for things like policies in a hotel. All of this makes me wonder whether or not developers of these privacy policies pay attention to their target audiences when making them. For example, if social media is targeted towards young audiences, privacy policies should be shorter and at a lower reading level to best appeal to teens. The graph shows higher reading times for these media, however, which is surprising to me. I would name this graph \"Privacy Policies: Time to Read?\"",

This then leads me to further wonder whether websites INTENTIONALLY write more difficult-to-read privacy policies, and if so, for what reason. For example, is Snapchat writing a high-school reading level privacy policy because its creator(s) believe(s) that Snapchat should be used mostly by high schoolers? Are Netflix and Facebook writing privacy policies at college reading levels because their intended audience is people in college or of a general college 'age'?

The disparity in the readability scores of popular companies, with Amazon's policy being easier to read than Walt Disney's, leads me to believe that the popularity of a company may not be a significant factor involving readability levels. The largest age group of those using the websites and apps might also play a role, as many of the users who contributed to the survey may have different reading capabilities. For instance, a child playing an app created by Walt Disney might not even read the privacy policy. I also notice how different works of literature are used to demonstrate the difficulty of and the time required to read each company's private policy's readability on the graph.

On the surface, the graph depicts this notion that privacy policies are often above some users' comprehensible level; however, hidden within this idea is the fact that when users don't understand the conditions, they also cannot defend themselves from them either. \n\n2) The practice of creating predatory policies that can often circumvent legal protections is not a new concept; however, with more recent privacy crackdowns (such as policy coming from the EU), companies must find ways to maintain their questionable practices while also maintaining an illusion of transparency. YouTube recently came under legal scrutiny for their violations of privacy laws including children. Despite legal protections of children's data, they marketed themselves to advertising companies as a hub for kid-friendly content thus ensuring financial gain. Their defense was centered around their terms of service requiring users to be 13 years or older, yet they don't actually require verification. While they may have been penalized, many instances of predatory data collection fly under the radar.\n\n3) With the rapid development of new technology and data that is readily accessible online, legal diction and confusing verbiage allows companies to take advantage of its consumers from monetary and legal gain. The only way to combat this is to move in the direction of the EU and modernize policy.",

Upon doing some research, I found that in 2017, Disney was sued for tracking kid's data through their apps. The only way huge corporation companies, such as Disney, can protect themselves from these types of lawsuits is through their privacy policy. If their privacy policy is complex enough, parents may not take the time to fully understand what they are agreeing to, since they trust that the company always provides safe services for children.\n2) I noticed that Netflix and Facebook are right above A Brief History of Time in terms of readability score and Snapchat is below it by 100. The readability score of  A Brief History of Time may be shown on the graph as reaching college level, but I found, more specifically, that the age range is from 15-17. This is important because by 15-17 years old, many teenagers have access to social media and they should be able to understand the privacy policy that is provided with these apps.  \n3) I wonder why it took more time to read Etsy's privacy policy rather than the policies for Netflix, Facebook, Snapchat, and Imgur. Was the privacy policy for Etsy actually a lot longer? Considering that the readability score does not change drastically between these companies, it really makes me wonder if people value their money  spent on Etsy and  its return policies, rather than their privacy.",

I wonder if companies do this to get more people into using their site so they can hide any unlikeable policies.",

I wonder whether companies decide to make their policies long, extremely long knowing that most of the public won't read and so I feel that if they are later on sued, the consumer is bound to lose if they agreed to their privacy policy. I just wonder if the companies think like this for the long run or just don't think about this in general. \n\n3.)
