    "comment info": "Being someone who is interested in science, I find this graph fascinating. This graph shows multiple trends that may hint at many things. As time goes on in the graph, there are more earthquakes of lesser magnitude. There are also fewer earthquakes above a magnitude of 7 in the last 40 years. That being said, recent earthquakes seem to have more potential for high death tolls. The question for these trends is, why? \nFirst, the higher death tolls could be attributed to higher population, going from 20 million in 1950, to 80 million in 2020. This would lead to higher death tolls due to higher population density. \nSecondly, why are there an increase in the number of small earthquakes? I believe this could be attributed to an increase in technology of the region. Before 1960, seismometers may have just not been sensitive enough to detect an earthquake with a magnitude smaller than 5. However, there is also a trend for a decrease in high magnitude earthquakes. It appears that in the last 120 years, there have been a trend for smaller, more frequent earthquakes in turkey, indicating more frequent releases of energy in the crust. In my opinion, this graph shows how many documents can give more insight than what is obvious at a glance.",

I wonder if the quality of  infrastructure in 2023 contributed to having less deaths in relation to the earth quake of 1939.\nThis graph educates our country to continually renovate and modernize infrastructure  and to have trained professionals and aid campaigns ready at any moment. My community experienced something like this twice. Firstly when there were the recent earthquakes in the Umbria region, in this earthquake many lives were lost due to the burocratic tendencies of our government and aid campaigns. The second time I experienced something like this was when the Morandi bridge collapsed in my city(Genoa) due to a lack of funding of rennovations for the bridge. 4.

A magnitude 8 earthquake in 2023 will have fewer deaths than the 1939 Turkey earthquake. The death toll from the 2000 earthquake is higher due to the higher death toll from earthquakes of magnitude 6 and above. In 2023, it will exceed the total number of deaths. 2. I suspect that the number of deaths from small facilities may have increased due to the amount of structures currently in place compared to those that existed in the early days. 3. The amount of aid coming from the United States could delay things here, including sending medical workers and rescue teams training here. 4. An earthquake will destroy a country, but it will be felt all over the world I noticed that Turkey and Syria will have the highest death toll from major earthquakes in 2023.

The largest circles all happen during earthquakes with magnitudes between 6.5 - 8. However, I also noticed that three out of the four large circles are located after 1990. This makes me wonder why this is. I expected that the opposite would be true since as time goes on, technology and engineering advance. I thought that more safety measures would be in place as the year gets closer to the present. The only reason I could think of for the higher deaths later on is that maybe the buildings are old and not the most structurally sound. They were safer when they were first built, which for many of them was before 1990. This relates to my community and me because these circles represent real human lives. The graph is very telling of the hardships and losses Turkey and Syria have faced due to all these earthquakes. Perhaps my community could help keep people there safe in future earthquakes now that we know how prone this area is to large earthquakes.

This, paired with the high population density, and large amounts of impoverished people living in slums with unstable structures, especially near the Syrian border due to a large number of refugees, which creates a ticking time bomb.  This can be seen by the fact that all the high-magnitude earthquakes with high death tolls are located in the Middle East. This is also interesting to note how, despite these countries may not have the highest magnitude (namely the 1988 Armenian quake) but have disproportionally larger death tolls than other quakes of that magnitude. \nI wonder where the high magnitude quakes with low death tolls are centered. I hypothesize around the center of Turkey where there is less population density. \nThis directly affects the community of people I interact with because I have a close friend who lives in Turkey who, thankfully, neither she nor her family was hurt, but her dad did lose his source of income because the building he worked in was destroyed.

I also wonder if the structuring of their buildings and whether or not they are earthquake-proof had to play in effect with the death poll because many of the buildings in Syria for example are concrete. \nHow does this impact you and your community?: I have family in Syria and Turkey who got affected and I have friends who also had family affected.

Theses are not just numbers.  We should not forget that.  \n\nYou know that the number of deaths is not just a function of the magnitude of the earthquakes.  Not adhering to construction codes and the decade-long civil war in Syria have contributed to the number of deaths.  These factors make the results of earthquakes so different than what has happened in California.\n\nThank you for your response.",

They were 7.7, 7.6, and 7.8 magnitude, and killed between 17,000-32,000 people. Only one other earthquake has killed nearly as many people which was in Armenia when 25,000 people were killed. I wonder what makes Turkey get these high magnitude earthquakes. I wonder why the high magnitude earthquakes in Turkey kill so many people compared to other high magnitude earthquakes. In the 1920's there was an earthquake with around a magnitude of just under 8, but that did not kill anywhere near as many as the ones in Turkey. Is it the layout and architecture, the land, the length of earthquakes, etc. This affects my community because I want to do something in math or engineering, so it would be interesting to look into how the building that collapsed due to the earthquake were designed in comparison to any that did not. Also, how can we learn what worked from other high magnitude earthquakes with a much smaller death toll. \nDeath From Earthquakes: Turkey and Syria",

Every single country has been affected by climate change in some way, and the earthquakes becoming more devastating as of recent could be a result of this (ex: the tectonic plates shifting in a new way due to the global warming). \nTitle: \n- \"Does Magnitude Affect Deaths?: Earthquakes in Turkey and Syria\"",

The biggest earthquake was the one in Turkey 1939 with a magnitude of 7.7 and EST DEATHS 32,000. These are only earthquakes shown around Turkey and northern Syria. I wonder how come the most recent one was in Turkey and Syria and had the most magnitude but only the 3rd most deaths.This doesn\u2019t relate specifically to me but it can relate to groups in Arkansas that send letters to kids in Syria and how this could affect the kids there and the organization.

    "comment info": "I notice that higher magnitude earthquakes lead to a greater number of deaths. There is a large gap between the 1939 Turkey earthquake, which led to 32,000+ deaths, and the 1988 Armenia earthquake, which led to 25,000+ deaths. I also notice that most earthquakes that have killed most people have taken place in Turkey and areas of the middle east. I wonder why this is. What is it about Turkey's geographical makeup that causes high-magnitude earthquakes, leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of people? This affects me because earthquakes are natural disasters that kill thousands of innocent people.

While the y-axis shows the magnitude of the earthquake. The earthquake with the greatest amount of deaths happened in Turkey in 1939. The graph also shows several other earthquakes that had the highest number of fatalities: Armenia 1988, Turkey 1999, Turkey and Syria 2023. \n\nI wonder why the earthquakes tend to be of greater magnitude in this area. I wonder why there are more high fatality earthquakes in recent years and more often. Before 1988, the last very high fatality earthquake was in 1939. \n\nThis relates to be because more earthquakes of higher magnitude will likely effect the whole planet. I think that this increase is likely because of global warming and climate change, so we need to figure out ways how to prevent this. \n\nHeadline: \"Earthquakes on the Rise in the Middle East\"",

I also notice that since 1960 the frequency for earthquakes seems to have increased. There have been more earthquakes in recent years with low casualty rates. I noticed that Turkey approached an 8 magnitude earthquake three times.

However, I did notice that between the years 1939 and 1988, there were still earthquakes with large magnitudes, however, there were less deaths. What caused this difference? Perhaps it was the location of the earthquake? Many catastrophic earthquakes with larger death tolls happen in areas with dense populations.

This directly connects to the recent earthquake in these areas from early February.  The main thing that stands out to me is how there is a very large frequency of earthquakes in this area.  Another thing that stands out is how certain earthquakes of larger magnitudes occasionally have lower death rates than certain ones, like the 1988 one in Armenia, for example.  This is quite interesting because one would assume quakes with larger magnitudes would have the most deaths.  I wonder what the reasoning behind these seemingly inconsistencies are.  Are the areas more or less populated?  Were people a bit more prepared?  Did rescue teams have a quicker strategy to help people?

Due to their dot's large size, the earthquake in Turkey in 1939, the earthquake in Armenia in 1988, the earthquake in Turkey in 1999, and the earthquake in Turkey and Syria in 2023 resulted in large numbers of estimated deaths.\n\n2. I wonder why earthquakes in Turkey have such a high magnitude in comparison to earthquakes in other places. The earthquakes in this country have magnitudes close to 8 (very high!) and have a large number of deaths, whereas the rest in the graph are located at lower magnitudes and have fewer estimated deaths.\n\n3. Although my community and I do not experience earthquakes in our area, recently, there were earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, causing a massive number of casualties. Therefore, this visual is relevant to the events happening recently.\n\n4. There doesn't seem to be a correlation between the years and the magnitude of earthquakes. However, there does seem to be a moderate, positive correlation between the magnitude of the earthquake and the estimated deaths. This means that as the magnitude of the earthquake increases, the number of deaths typically increases. \n\nHeadline Idea: \"Turkey Experiences \"Shock\"ingly High Magnitudes of Earthquakes, Resulting In Several Casualties.\"",

    "comment info": "1) What do you notice?\nOf the earthquakes prior to 1960 they primarily had magnitudes above 6, after 1960 said level of magnitude was lowered, ranging from 4-8. Following this, earthquakes occurred at a more frequent rate after 1960. Between 1940 & 2023, three major earthquakes transpired at a magnitude of 7+, each with death tolls beyond 10,000. In incorporating, the 6.8 magnitude earthquake that resulted in Armenia at an estimated death toll of 25,000+, it comes to relay that high levels of magnitude do not necessarily result in the greatest amount of deaths, as the one in Armenia had a substantially higher death toll than 2 of the quakes at Turkey despite its lower magnitude level. \n2) What do you wonder?\nWhat factors may induce an earthquake to occur? Is there something about the location of Turkey that caused an earthquake of great magnitude to occur three times? How have places that had frequent occurrences of earthquakes adapted to the situation to better benefit themselves? \n3) How does this relate to you and your community?\nI nor someone I know has had experience with an earthquake, much less one of great devastation. However, considering, this is an occurrence that can come about anywhere, it is always a possibility, this may be something we may have to deal with in the future. \n4) What\u2019s going on in this graph?\nHeadline: The Devastation Continues!

Turkey and Armenia are at the intersection of tectonic plate activity, which explains why larger earthquakes have occurred in these regions. After 1960, there were fewer earthquakes with magnitudes less than 6. The Armenian earthquake had a higher death toll than the 1999 earthquake in Turkey, indicating that a greater magnitude does not equate to a higher death count.\n\n2) Does location in conjunction with the magnitude have an effect on the death toll, explaining why the Armenia earthquake of 1988 killed more people than earlier Turkish earthquakes of higher magnitude? Is the year in which these earthquakes happened significantly in terms of the mortality toll? Are there any unnoticed factors in the graph that address these questions?\n\n3) Earthquakes have a secondary influence on nations that are not directly affected. Infrastructure, business/trade, roads, jobs, education, and so on are all impacted and taken away from people. During high-magnitude earthquakes, residents frequently migrate to a safer location. The recovery process necessitates a large number of resources that the affected areas lack; it takes time to rebuild a region's economic and societal stability.

From 1900-1960 the deaths were fairly linear, most deaths falling between a magnitude of 6-7. Within this time frame, the largest amount of estimated deaths were in 1939 Turkey, with a magnitude of 7.7. After 1960, there were less earthquakes of higher magnitudes but more clusters. I imagine this is due to the fact that the higher magnitude earthquakes caused more deaths, making clusters less possible compared to a lot of smaller earthquakes occurring around the same time. I also noticed that out of the 4 major earthquakes that are larger circles, Turkey was affected by most (3/4). \n2) What do you wonder?\nAfter the 2000's there is an increase in magnitude after having a downward trend for a period of time prior, so I wonder if we will ever see an earthquake that surpasses the magnitude and/or deaths of Turkey, 1939. \n3) How does this relate to you and your community?\nMany in my community have not experienced earthquakes, but the graph can relate to us as we can work towards helping those who do have to deal with these disasters by bringing awareness and providing aid.\n4) What\u2019s going on in this graph?\nThe graph depicts deaths in major earthquakes since 1900 around Turkey and northern Syria.

At first glance, it seems that there were more deaths between 2000 and 2023 because there are a ton of more circles in the area. But it is definitely okay to say that earthquakes with magnitudes higher than 6 caused about 3 times more deaths than earthquakes with magnitudes less than 6. \n\n2. I wonder what caused Turkey to have two times where the estimated deaths were about 32,000+ and 17,000+ for earthquakes with a magnitude between 7 and 8?

The graph seems to be negative, moderate, and linear if we were to make a line from top left to bottom right. \n2) I wonder why Aremania 1988 had more deaths than Turkey 1999 when it had a greater magnitude. Does this prove that the higher the magnitude is, the death rate varies on the location? What can we do as a society to prevent an earthquake from happening? I understand that is what Mother Nature's doing, but there must be some human interaction causing this phenomenon. \n3) In New Jersey, we hardly ever get earthquakes- so I never experienced one.

The most hazardous earthquakes, according to my observation, occurred in Turkey, Armenia, and Syria, with Turkey having an incredible three main quakes with magnitudes above 7. I also notice that there have been more earthquakes recently, with the number of earthquakes doubling after 1960 when they went from being very strong to being moderately weak. Since some earthquakes with magnitudes close to 8 have hardly any fatalities, the graph disproves the common belief that the higher the magnitude, the more deaths.\n\n2. First, I'm curious as to why there have been twice as many earthquakes since 1960. Is this a result of rising populations or unstable building designs that have been made taller in many parts of the world? A change in our environment and the Earth's composition, which makes it simpler for these occurrences to recur, could also be blamed for the rise in smaller earthquakes below the magnitude of 5.\n\n3. In New Jersey, I have never experienced an earthquake, and they are not at all common in this region. However, I believe that in the event of an earthquake, the number of fatalities would be relatively low given the lack of tall buildings in the area where I live. Unlike our neighboring state New York, where a single building collapsing could result in a significant number of fatalities.\n\n4.  \"The Effect of Earth's Deadliest Temper Tantrums\"",

For example, in 1999 the 7.6 magnitude earthquake had roughly 17000 people die whereas in 2023 the 7.8 magnitude earthquake had roughly 20000 people die. I wonder why there was an anomaly in 1988 where the 6.8 magnitude earthquake had roughly 25000 people die. I just find it interesting that this specific earthquake had killed so many more people than the 7.6 magnitude earthquake and the 7.8 magnitude one. Also, I am curious as to why, with the more modern technology, so many more people had passed in more recent years. Yes, an earthquake can kill many, but I'm surprised with better technology and earlier warnings, how more people didn't try to get to better grounds, etc. This relates to my community and I because where I am from, the west side of Washington, there are many active volcanoes in our area. The Mount Saint Helen's eruption had killed many in 1980 and Mount Rainier is said to be long overdue for its eruption. In this graph you can see the different sized circles on a graph with years from 1900 on where they mark how many people died in a specific earthquake.",
