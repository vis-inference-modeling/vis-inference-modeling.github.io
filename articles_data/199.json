She has more of the support in the area and is holding a total of 987 votes. Which means she had 68% of the population on her side.",

There seems to be a huge backlash each time Trump says or does something, which I took to mean there was a small support for trump. But I know realize it is because the Trump supporters have no need to go out on social media and defend their beliefs since they already got what they wanted. A republican in office. And if they back down from this they will have to admit they made a mistake. And they wouldn't  do that would they?\n\nI wonder how the area the voters live in affects their voting. Maybe an adult version of peer pressure? There are many \u201cvoter islands\u201d and most of them are for Republicans. I wonder why that is.\n\n\u201cA republican age\u201d As more millenials and gen Z children come of voting age, the support for a more liberal or democratic government continues to grow. However, many of the older generations continue to vote Republican. It is unclear why, but the fact that the Democratic candidate was a woman, the wife of a past president, and had discrepancies in their statements through interviews and speeches(though Donald Trump has many of his own), may play a role in this. Hopefully as more of the younger Americans come of voting age, elections will be, not a way to keep the country in one place but rather, a vote for the candidate that will help us move forward.",

Despite this, I wonder how nearly half of the country can live in such a small area.

I also wonder why the blue areas are so separated while the red areas are much more conjoined.

But, in my town, and on the east coast of Massachusetts in general, Hilary Clinton had the majority of the votes. In my precinct in particular, she had 52% of the votes, while Trump only had 39% of the votes. Massachusetts appears to be the state with the highest percentage of Hilary supporters, and New England in general seems to be the region that supports Hilary the most. But, while all counties in Massachusetts voted the majority for Hilary Clinton, there are some towns that voted for Trump. In fact, in one of the towns adjacent to my own, Donald Trump received 52% of the votes. This leads me to wonder how two towns that are so close and so similar can have completely different outcomes in their election results. I also wondered how the election was so close considering most of the map was red. The answer to that question, I realized, was that many of the most densely populated cities in the country voted for Hilary, while many sparsely populated areas voted for Trump. If I were to come up with a title for this graph, it would be \u201cWhy the Colors May Not Tell the Whole Story,\u201d because this graph does not appear to be an accurate representation of how close the election was.",

In my town, 58% of voters or 3,186 people voted for Donald Trump while 36% of voters or 1,996 people voted for Hilary Clinton. However, if you travel south for about 20 minutes, the area begins to favor Hilary Clinton by a larger majority. In Lawrence, Massachusetts, where a large population of Hispanic and Black voters lives, Hilary is favored to 86% over Trump\u2019s 10%. My question is this: should we consider the electoral college outdated? Wouldn\u2019t it make sense for majority votes to dictate the outcome of elections? This map is meant to physically illustrate how the country tended to vote during the 2016 Presidential Election. The discoloration on the graph is there to indicate which states, regions, and towns voted for which primary candidate, and how popular the candidate is in the recorded data.   If I was to create a title for the map shown, \u201cAmerica Is More Purple Than We Are Led to Believe\u201d seems to be the most fitting. Since popular vote was in favor of Clinton (by a small margin), but the electoral college votes tilted towards Trump, America is in a time of political separation; there are seemingly equal amounts of people that support each candidate in each party, it\u2019s just that distribution of the votes that create a majority \u201cred\u201d map.",

In my precinct, Clinton had 52% of the votes whereas Trump only had about 39%. At first, I was shocked to see to all the different areas of the countries and which were primarily Trump voters and which were Clinton votes. However, after focusing on my area alone, it did not shock me to see and large imbalance in voters in support of Clinton. I begin to wonder what exactly this graph would show if the data was from like 2000 election or even father back. Would the demographics change significantly of would it be primality based on the candidates. If I had to give this graph a name, I think I would name it \"A Sea of Red\" because at first glance, the map seems to show an overwhelming amount of red across the states almost like one big body of water...but it's instead of a blue sea its red.",

One can see that the East Coast and the West Coast have a more dominant presence of the color blue than the rest of the country, as well as lower Texas and parts of New Mexico, where it is obvious that there are a good amount of Democratic supporters. As you zoom in, I think it's important to see that there are parts of the states that seem to be in complete support of the Republican, which was Trump at the time, that are in support of Hilary who was the Democratic campaigner. I wonder why the creators of the map decided to make a state completely red, even when there were cities within that state that were blue. I think it's important to not only show a state's majority but also the minority. I also wonder why the East Coast and the West Coast favored Hilary and the rest of the country supported Trump. What factors were involved? Was religion involved? If it was, does one specific religion only support one side? As I zoom in to where I live, my town and the surrounding area is mostly blue. As you get closer to NH it becomes predominately red. I live on the border of MA and NH, so my town voted 48% (Trump) and 42% (Hilary). It's interesting to see how the closer you get to certain states, the more the votes vary and favor one campaigner over the other.

Then my eye started to gravitate towards the Massachusetts area and I noticed that it was blue, and the states directly North and South of Massachusetts seem to create this blue line down the Eastern coast of the country that stops and curves above Florida and continues West until Alabama. I began looking for other blue areas and I noticed that the West coast (California and Washington) seems to follow a similar trend, skipping over Oregon. I then searched for how my town and the surrounding towns voted and found that they mostly voted for Clinton, with my town divided 63% for Clinton and 27% for Trump. The map showed me that the closest Trump area to my town was Peabody, about a 17-minute drive away. It was interesting to see how my town voted compared to the state and to the entire country.

    "comment info": "I noticed that in the 2016 election, Donald Trump had the majority of the country's support. When I went into my zip code, just about everyone supported Hillary Clinton with some Trump supporters by me in the Borough Park area. I also noticed that a majority of metropolitan areas even in the south and some midwest states were more Democratic compared to the surrounding suburban and rural areas. Cities like Dallas and Atlanta had support within its city limits but extending out of the city is a sea of red signifying Trump's support. This is also the case in other bigger Texas cities as well as cities in the Plains like Oklahoma City or Des Moines. \n\nI wonder why this is the case. Why are the metropolitan, bigger cities voting Democratic especially in Republican heavy regions like the Plains and the South where I can see why they support him. \n\nCatchy headline: \"Democrats Dominate the Metropolitan\"",

If you take a look at the midterm results athttps://tinyurl.com/2018ByDistrict, I wonder if the voting results for your area changed from 2016 to 2018. (You\u2019ll notice that the 2016 map is by precinct and the 2018 map is by House of Representative district, so you\u2019ll have to qualify your analysis.)  Are any cities in the country changing their voting pattern?\nKeep noticing, wondering, and sharing your conjectures.",

The few places where there is blue appear to be on the outside of the country and the middle has less.  \n\nI wonder why there is more red than blue shown on the map even though the true split is around half blue and half red?\n\nA headline could be: \"Is the US really split Red and Blue?\"",
