It is clear that the graphs are used to compare the length of time needed to transmit cargo from Indonesia to Orlando, Florida through the title of the comparison. I believe it is longer because of the social issues like the pandemic causing many workers to stay home due to fear of getting sick. In general, many of the processes like the lead times and times needed to anchor in the seas have been extended likely due to the lack of staff. This affects me and my community because, with longer wait times, we'll have to wait longer for certain goods that we utilize on a daily basis. We might have to wait weeks or even months just for a single product we like from a specific company as a result of these delays. I believe that with this information I can come up with the headline \"The Cargo Can't Wait to Travel! Or Maybe It's Waiting too Much?\", which uses satire and humor in order to attract an audience to educate them on why shipments are taking longer than usual.",

It is also clear that there is an increase in shipping and trade, which can be attributed to the pandemic. Companies are being overwhelmed with orders and are unable to keep up with the demand from consumers.\n2. I ponder about the causes of this increase in traffic. While the graph does state capacity limits, extra anchorage times, and natural disasters all contribute to the increase, other factors must play an impact. For example, how exactly did the pandemic cause this issue? I also wonder how long it will take for the traffic to alleviate.\n3. This graph relates to my community and I because shipping issues are nationwide, not just to Florida. For example, tennis balls are in high demand, as the sport is a safe way to remain active without interacting with others. In my tennis club, we did not receive new ball shipments for several months, demonstrating the effects the shipping crisis has on my community.\n4. The graph depicts two shipping patterns from Indonesia to Florida. The bar on the left shows the typical pattern, while the bar on the right illustrates the current and unusual pattern. The current pattern is much longer, and the graph describes certain reasons behind this increase in trade time.",

This significant because in theory, it could cause almost a month in delay for the shipping to arrive to consumers. \n2. This graph has made me wonder what other products are being delayed this long and what would be the cause of it. The graph mentions port congestion, and terminal digestion stemming from local deliveries in Vancouver. My question is that how and why are these problems occuring. One guess is that since quarantine, the demand has been unusually high and has created more demand for these products as shown by the trike (three-wheeled vehicles). If that is the problem, then I think the best option may be to wait out the pandemic until most people have been vaccinated, and hopefully things will go back to normal as it was before. Huge delays like the one shown in the graph is very problematic and indeed does disrupt the entire global trade. \n3. The graph shown and the delay time hasn't affected my community in significant ways. I did notice, however, a slight delay in Amazon delivery and I'm not too sure if it is also a result of the graph.

All the components of the process has increased by at least a couple of days, with the transportation part (I'm guessing cargo ships for international purposes) by 15 days. I wonder the reason for these delays is due partially to the pandemic and the shortage in workers in the shipping industry, specifically in the ports. Not only in ports, but warehouses who need people to work the equipment meant to transport cargo from certain places. This would lead to cargo just laying for days and create a backlog in the system, which would further delay the process with ships waiting and taking up space in the ports (port congestion).

With the smaller capacity limits, the ships have to wait 10 days longer before they are able to depart.

This past year (and even currently), people have relied on online shopping to purchase a majority of their products, and the amount of goods purchased from stores has significantly increased. I'd assume that these factors have played a major role in the delays.\n\n2. I wonder if this issue will get resolved, and how quickly. It seems like the rate of online shopping will continue to increase as we continue implementing technology and online services into our daily lifestyles, so I'm not sure if they'll have an opportunity to shut down the ports to reduce the port congestion. I am curious to see how this will play out in the future, and hope there will be a solution to these complications.\n\n3. These delays are causing products to become unavailable to customers, which could include brands that my family uses regularly. While there are countless alternatives, it's just wild to think that products that have been in stores for decades on end have been unavailable recently.\n\n4.

Could it be because there is more cargo? Then it takes 15 more days to get transported to Vancouver which could be because of higher demand so there is more port congestion. There is also a two day difference between the cargo getting transported to Ferndale which makes me wonder what the reason is for this delay. Then there is a one day difference for the cargo ending in Orlando which is not that much of a difference so it still could be because of the amount of cargo that is being transported.\n\nA good graph title would be: Cargo Schmargo: Why is cargo taking a longer time to deliver?",

The typical transit time of 59 days has increased to 87 days due to capacity limits, port congestion, terminal congestion, railway delivery delays, and full warehouses. My first question is when the first bar that shows a 59 day transit time is from. If it was pre-covid, that might give some explanation to the increase in transit time. If it was not from before covid, I wonder why the transit times have increased so much recently. I also wonder how these longer transit times are affecting things here in the US. This depends on what cargo is being imported. If we can't import raw materials fast enough, I think shortages in certain products could be likely since we can't manufacture them soon enough.

    "comment info": "1. I noticed that limits in the amount of products ships can hold is delaying lead times. Along with limited capacity, extra anchorage time also leads to delayed shipping and transport times, as it causes port congestion. For example, before arriving in Orlando it can take up to 60 days for the whole transport and departure process to take place. \n2. I wonder if the long and extra port congestion will have an impact on the environment of ports. Port waters are already filled with boats unloading cargo, and delayed departures from ports leads to more fuel and gas being deposited into the bodies of water around these ports. This not only pollutes the water but endangers aquatic life and the ecosystem of that body of water. \n3. This relates to me and my community because as global trade becomes more popular and easier, people are more likely to buy international goods. This means increased shipments and ships in port waters because of limited capacity and increased product demand. More ships in ports means a longer delay in ports and more pollution in the body of water. Many people demand fast shipping but don't realize the larger negative impacts it has on our environment. \n4. Title: \"Snail Shipping\"",

Many Americans are facing a very large increase in the cost of goods but also a very large increase in the shipping time for goods. This is because, as shown in the graph, the cargo ports and warehouses are so congested from the surplus shipping of goods that it is putting a delay on all goods. I notice that typical transit times from Indonesia to Orlando, Fla. is 59 days, but now it takes 87 days. That is a huge increase in time for goods to ship and so I wonder what it is going to take to fix this. I also think that during the holiday season, this time is just going to continue to increase because now everyone has to buy gifts. I wonder when things are going to get better and if they are, how are people going to fix it.  The biggest reason for this is Coronavirus. This virus has changed every dynamic in the world. Everyone is ordering items online rather than going out to buy them because they don't need to be in contact with people online. This affects me and my community because I have experienced shipping delays in the past few months/year. I have ordered items online and when they normally ship in 1-2 weeks, they have shipped a month. This is affecting everyone in the world and I hope that it gets better soon.

I noticed that it now takes a longer time to ship goods from Indonesia to Orlando Florida. The transportation time for the goods had increased from 59 days to 87 days. This is due to port congestion, extra anchorage time and terminal congestion. The boat traveling time has increased from 38 days to 53 days.  Cargo preparation in Indonesia now takes 18 days while before it only took 8 days. I wonder what is causing these shipping delays.  I think it may be due to the shortage of workers in the shipping industries.  Also many deliveries are behind which is causing port congestion. I also wonder if the coronavirus pandemic affected the shipping deliveries. Are there less workers and delays in the shipping industry due to the coronavirus pandemic? This affects my community because my family and I often order stuff online from Amazon.  These shipping delays can cause the things that we ordered to get delayed. Also shipping delays can lead to a limit on products that I use everyday.  Stores may have low stock on items that I use from shipping delays. Also prices might increase due to less supply but more demand.  \nCatchy Title = Shipping Delays and Why They Occur",

The biggest increase in days is with the transportation time with 15 days. The port congestion and carrying capacity seem to make life hard for those who need certain products. \nQ2. Why are warehouses at their capacities if it is taking forever to even transport it to them? What is it like to sit on a ship and wait to get into a port? How do these times and the changes to them compare to the times and changes of the airplanes? Are there any international products that take superiority over other products (like they get expedited somehow)?\nQ3. In Hawaii, we are highly dependent on the shipment of products as we are an island nation and cannot produce many products. We can produce products that can be grown but manufactured products or products that need to go through factories and/or warehouses. When shipping to Hawaii, people often run into issues such as paying higher prices for postage and dealing with long delivery times. USPS is the only shipping carrier that treats shipping to Hawaii the same as shipping to any other state in the country. Since it costs extra money and time to ship things to Hawaii, the added time because of congestion and capacity limits will affect us heavily.

I also notice that most of the reasons for delay are because of a lack of capacity in ships, ports, trains, warehouses, etc. All of these things have caused every process to take from 1 to 15 additional days. I wonder what causes the port conjunction in Vancouver, is it Covid related and is due to the number of people trying to find safer ways to purchase items or could it just be an uprise of companies using ships to transport their products? The same goes with the other modes of transportation and storage, why are all of the warehouses full these days compared to how they used to be? Could it also be because many businesses got affected by Covid-19 and are just now beginning to pick up the pace, therefore, causing more things to be produced and shipped out? Also, how does this affect the businesses that need these supplies? This could seriously affect the way a business is able to run and could even shut them down if they are not able to get the correct supplies for their products.

I wonder how and why the capacity limits changed in Indonesia since it is impacting the lead times to be longer. Additionally, I wonder when porting congestion and extra anchorage started to occur because it has impacted the departure and arrival times to increase significantly. I wonder what they are doing to reduce the cargo transit times and resolve the issue like using planning, a better outsourcing model, and stronger scheduling. This relates to me and my community because there is an ongoing trend with economic outsourcing especially online. An abundance of people ranging from adolescents to adults order a lot of things online. While ordering online, there is a long delayment in shipping packages out and obtaining our deliveries. We figured out a portion of why sometimes things don't come in on time and why things outside the country take a long time to ship. The graph demonstrates how a larger population and increase in supply and demand impacts outsourcing in the cargo transit times from Indonesia to Orlando, Florida; additionally, it may impact future production and outsourcing which can cause distress.

I also wonder how many facilities are still open, to keep storage. I know that everywhere in the world, including my community, is ordering stuff online because of covid. This might lead to why all these facilities are full. A headline for this would be, \"Online Shopping leads to delays for Cargo Ships\".",

This is mainly because of the capacity limits in these two places which leads to delays and longer transportations.\n2. What I am wondering is why does it now take longer? Is it because of the supply and demand of COVID?\n3. This relates to me because I order things online all of the time. The supply and demand really affects the shipping, and how long it is going to take. A lot of things also are not in stock because of this.\n4. Supply and Demand of goods to do recent Pandemic",

Capacity limits seems to also slow down the process and creates more delays to when the ships arrive in Vancouver wildfires have delayed deliveries. When things are brought in, it's hard to get thing on land because everything is delayed and there is no space to get it of and to continue this process again. It is interesting how much this has delayed the world around us because of everything being delayed and more goods are needed and the demand only gets higher. This also rises a lot of prices on many good due to limits.",

    "comment info": "It is a widely held belief that bottlenecks disrupt global trade and affect us all. \nTo begin with, lots of delays are undoubtedly observed during cargo transit times and cause supply chain problems, which are really crucial. These delays may be results of misorganization, extra anchorage time or even wildfires. It goes without saying that these retardations may be proven extremely important and can impact negatively on our lives, relationships, habits, or even priorities.\nIn my opinion, should global trade be disrupted, we will all be deprived of food, medication and clothes, due to the undenible fact that our world operates through trade, imports and exports, as globalization is increased day by day.\nI am inclined to think that global trade is an integral part of our lives and existence, as the fact of realizing that we, people, cannot do without it is really vital.",
