    "comment info": "This map shows the increased amount of air travel that occurs around Thanksgiving. A lot more people are going towards the east coast than the west, I believe this is occurring because the east coast has more people living closer together in more states and bigger cities. Whereas California basically takes up the entire West Coast with a more spread out population. As I continue to look at the map I notice that Las Vegas, Orlando, and Honolulu have a lot of people flying into them but not very many flying out. The opposite is true for Seattle, San Francisco, and Salt Lake city, lots of people are leaving and not many are flying in. \n\nIf you look at the east coast there is a large amount of travel happening between the states most of these states have an equal number of coming and going people, except for Florida which as more people flying into it. I'm noticing people are traveling to the warmer places from the cooler places, for example, A lot of people are traveling from up north like Boston to down south like Miami and Orlando. I wonder if people are trying to get away from the cold for holiday\u2019s and are going to someplace warm.",

Looking at the map, I wonder what the big gap between the main two routes between Seattle and San Francisco mean.

    "comment info": "When looking at this graph, you notice that major cities across the country have a large increase in travel demand. The cities of Atlanta, Washington, and Boston, cities known for their cold climate, have the largest origin lines. The cities of Honolulu, Orlando, and Miami have the largest destination lines. This is probably because they are popular tourist areas and have a warm tropical climate, making them ideal places for families to reunite and celebrate Thanksgiving.  What\u2019s going on with this graph is that it is trying to show that people from cold areas are going to more tropical areas for Thanksgiving. I do wonder why families choose to celebrate in the warmer South instead of northern USA. A catchy headline for this map could be: Travel Demand to Southern USA increases as families try to escape a cold Thanksgiving",

These cities are generally southern and warmer. \n\nI wonder why this is the case, and a possible reason for this could be to escape the cold weather during the fall or winter vacations vacations. This makes eastern and southern destinations an ideal place for vacation, or places to meet up with family without a brutal climate. The east coast also has many attractions and picturesque vacation spots, such as NYC and Disney World.\n\nThe story this map is telling us is that majority of the destinations people go to for the fall/winter holidays are in the southern part of the U.S..

You bring up a very interest point about how a graph could reflect more than one variable.  \nHere, as stated in the instructions, population of the cities scales the increase in the number of passengers.  But you could reflect income or wealth rather than population.  \nFirst, ask yourself, what question you want to answer from a different graph with the variables of increase in passengers over Thanksgiving and income/wealth.  \nThen, think about how you could redesign the map to show this.  \nOr, would it be better to use another kind of graph?\nLet us know what you determine is the best way to show the data and what noticings may result.",

I wonder why some major cities are left off of the map, such as Houston, and Boise. As far as what is going on, it could be live for those airports around the nation, or it could be the congestion throughout these major airports.",

There is a greater demand during this time because many people go home to see their families.",

Although there is some congestion on the west, it seems minute in comparison to that of the east.\n\nI wonder how severe this congestion is, as I've never witnessed it in person since my family usually does not tend to travel during the season.\n\nThis graph definitely shows the popular travel routes that tend to have the most filled flights and most delay times in seemingly popular airports.",

Or families from Atlanta?\n\nThe story is telling the airline demand during Thanksgiving increases in big cities. Family gathering is not the only purpose of Thanksgiving, but travelling is another motivation. Especially cities in the south are going to boost their tourism.\n\nFlights to Florida, departure during Thanksgiving.",

That\u2019s a really good wondering \u2013 \u201cWhy is Houston, and other major cities in Texas, not included on the map?\u201d  \nDallas, which is on the map, is the 9th largest city in the U.
