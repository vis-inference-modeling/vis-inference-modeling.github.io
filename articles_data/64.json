For example a majority of people would not use the term Latinx or AAPI, and they\u2019re a majority who would use BIPOC as well. I wonder what their personal reason is for not using these words. I believe that it is because the people themselves that are apart of these groups don\u2019t like the use of these words to describe them, for example, I don\u2019t know any Latino person who wants to be called Latinx. This affects my community because we are all affect by what other people refer to us as and want our labels to be respected.

I think the graph is less a reflection of the words people use and more a projection. Most of the people who said they say spaz will probably think twice about it next time, the graph and article plants a seed of political correctness. Not that there much wrong with it but it could be done better.

I think that it is so interesting to see all the different names for one ethnic group that I\u2019ve never heard of before or would never even think to call someone. Through observing this graph, I noticed how the words that were commonly used, were the phrases that I\u2019ve heard spoken the most around me. I was also surprised to see that the acronym phrases, A.A Pi and BIPOC were used a fair bit, being phrases that I have never even heard of before. It's interesting to think about how different words impact other cultures and how it's essential to recognize how certain words are seen as respectful, while others may be derogatory. Talking to others, you should always be mindful of the racial terms you are using to address them, because you don't not know how a certain phrase will affect them. Regarding this,  it is important to acknowledge the cultures of others in my community because we are a very diverse town, filled with many different races of people. Recognizing how certain phrases and words impact those around us, is necessary for a connected and prosperous world.",

Though \u2018Latino\u2019 is a masculine adjective, masculine terms in Spanish are often used as a neutral term as well. If a more neutral term is still desired, you can use Latin-American. I\u2019ve also heard \u2018e\u2019 be suggested as a gender-neutral suffix in Spanish, which at least makes sense to say out loud. I described myself as Latine for a time while figuring out my gender, and I enjoyed useing the term-- however I can\u2019t really speak for others as I have lived a much whiter life than a Latino one.\nThe low usage of AAPI is likely caused by a mix of it not being as widely known to most people as other terms, and the fact that it conflates two different ethnic groups.\nThe term BIPOC has been used to replace the term POC by some, but it is a new term and from what I can tell it has very little difference from POC. Very few people feel the need to change to the new term due to what is often read as redundancy.\nI have no comments on the term nonwhite.\n\nNote that I am not a person of color!

When I hear people use the terms A.A.P.I and BIPOC, it's always on social media and never really in person, unless of course they\u2019re reading off something.",

Most of the terms that people voted yes on are what you most likely see. \n\tThe terms that were under 50% stood out to me. I have heard them but not as much as the others like the ones I hear out in public. I wonder if the people taking this survey were of different ages. More of the less common terms were used in the past or a while ago. It seems like the most used terms are the ones used most often in the news, social media, and other public sites. I do not think it is okay to call people \u201cnonwhite\u201d. This is implying many things to other races and it is not okay. People should learn to call others by their correct name, or their name in general.",

There is so many different terms used these days to describe people, because no one wants to offend anyone. It\u2019s hard to please everyone with the terms we use, and different people prefer to be called different things. Instead of using one word we think would be best, I think we should ask specific people with what they are comfortable with. For example, lots of people like to be called African American, and that's what I\u2019m used to saying as well. But, sometimes, it\u2019s not the correct term to use. For example, you can be Brazilian or Jamaican, so that term wouldn\u2019t fit. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important to ask others instead of basing what we say off of one graph. \n          Some of the terms on this graph I have never even heard before, and if lot\u2019s of people say they say it, I wonder if that's accurate. Are people putting certain responses based off what they think sounds the best?\n           In my community, I hear many terms that I would never dare saying. I live in the South, and go to high school, and I hear people say things in the hallways that they would never say to their grandparents. If my school took a survey, offensive terms would have extremely high percentages, which is so very sad. I think it\u2019s best",

Terms like hispanic, asian, or african american were largely used more than latinx, bipoc, or aapi. Furthermore, stating someone's specific background outweighed the use of all the more general phrases such as \"people of color\" or \"non-white,\" that category having every term be not used by over 50% of Americans. Out of all the terms, Americans would say Hispanic the most (87%) and Latinx the least (22%). \n2) What do you wonder?\nI wonder what was the racial demographic of the Americans surveyed, as well as their age range. From my point of view, the terms that seem to be used less in the graph are used more by younger, marginalized people, rather than those who are older and aren't used to certain descriptors.  \n3) How does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to my community because amongst my generation there has been a push for more inclusive language, which as seen by the graph consists of the terms being used the least.\n4) What\u2019s going on in this graph?\nThis graph shows different words, and the percent of Americans that would or would not say them.

I think that an important thing to clarify in the question is, is it in front of the person, or just even in person. People are much bolder behind people\u2019s backs, and on the internet, so I think that this clarification should be made. I also noticed how there was only one word in the middle of the graph, and that was the phrase, person of color. All the others were either a strong yes or a strong no. I don\u2019t know why this one is as contradicting as the other ones. All I know is that this phrase is very vague since a person of color could be anyone since we are all just different colors.\n\nAfter looking at the graph, I asked myself if I would use them, and I realized that I would only use 4 out of the 11 words listed. I think that the reason behind this is because I don\u2019t use a variety of words for the same ethnicity. I barely even talk about ethnicity,mostly because it isn\u2019t very prominent in my life. I believe that this would be the same for my family, since we grew up in mostly the same conditions. This leads me to my next point. I think that people use different words, because they grew up with people that used those words. If someone's parents uses the phrase, African american, than it is probable that they\u2019re kids will grow up using the same phrase.",

I\u2019m also surprised Americans said those terms at all because I don\u2019t even know what they mean. I feel like a lot of Americans are hesitant to use many racial terms these days because a lot of words and names can be interpreted and taken as racist. I think it's harder for older people to respect people of other races because when they were younger, many of those terms were normal and what everyone used so that's just what they are used to calling people with different races than them. I feel also that gen-z does a great job respecting what people want to be called when referring to their race. I once saw a YouTube survey video where people were asked what they were comfortable with people calling their race and the results were all very different so I believe the best way to figure out what you should call people with a different race is just ask them what they are comfortable with. I'm sure anyone would love to hear that you are curious and care about respecting what they want to be referred to as.",

I myself am Hispanic and I have only overheard the word \"Latinx\" less than three times in my life. I don't know exactly what it means, if it is different from Hispanic or Latino. Whenever I have been referred to as Latinx I haven't felt insulted or disrespected. \nThis relates to my community because there are several things that my Hispanic family and friends would feel insulted if someone used specific words to allude our Mexican heritage. I always thought and still do think that Hispanic is the most respectful way to refer to someone of Mexican heritage. I cannot speak my opinion for any other of these graphs because I am Hispanic so I don't know how any other person about their heritage personally feels.\nBut, I have always mentioned people from Asia or have heritage from Asia as Asians. And people of darker skin color as African American. Because that is what I always believed was to be the most respectful way to say it.\nThis graph is just showing what the majority of American Adults refer to people of different heritage. I have always believed that there is no need to call anyone by these names unless it is asked. I would never bluntly call someone by one of these names, I would always just call them by their name.

I replied to another New York Times article on an issue of racism and how a mural in a Law School is under the decision of removal after many onlookers felt uncomfortable with its art style and its portrayal of slavery. My opinion was that the ones who should decide what should happen with the mural should be the same people who were affected by what the mural depicts. Personally, being Caucasian, I don\u2019t experience racism as someone of color or race would and I'm not as affected by it but I can try to give my voice of reason.\n  In this day and age people forget what can be offensive and try to stick on the side that likely has no negative connotations. Calling someone \u201cblack\u201d or \u201casian\u201d to some 20% of people is not a term they would use but to the majority, these terms aren\u2019t racist and rather are just a descriptive feature that is provided when they look at someone.

Not many people in my area refer to others using \u201cLatinx\u201d, \u201cBIPOC\u201d, or \u201cA.A.I.P\u201d and usually stick to the more vague terms such as  \u201cAsian\u201d or \u201cHispanic\u201d. I can see why they aren\u2019t very popular in this study of about 4,500 people with \u201cno\u201d percentages of 78% for Latinx and 70% for BIPOC, likely because as I stated above, they are generally newer terms coming out in the 2000s. It makes sense that newer terms, especially related to race and ethnicity, are not used in order to avoid offending others because the meaning has not yet been globalized. While everyone can do a quick google search, just as I did, many people don\u2019t care to look or even know to look, thus resulting in a large population that doesn\u2019t understand the terms used above. This is why some of the most popular terms are \u201cHispanic\u201d or \u201cAsian\u201d when asked if Americans use certain terms when referring to race and ethnicity. Even though they are pretty vague, most people don\u2019t know any better. It\u2019s obvious that the longer a word is around for, the more widely accepted it's going to be in contrast to newer terms. \n\nPart 1",

As the list went down, the percentages of people who would use the word went down as well. It really does show you how scared people can be of using new or uncommon labels for a certain demographic. One word that really stuck out to me was \u201cnon-white\u201d. Personally, I really do not like that people use that to label a group of people. That word divides us into two categories, white and non-white. The term comes off as offensive and really seems like it is used to deem races other than white inferior. One thing I really wonder is what do the demographics of the answerers look like? I\u2019d like to know which generation/age was most popular within each vote, along with their race, political ideology, even religion could be relevant to these answers. \n     Growing up in the south, I have encountered  ignorant, uneducated and even racist people throughout being raised here. A lot of the time those said people will incorrectly label or name a certain group. For example, I have heard Hispanic people being referred to as Mexican so many times.

I think this survey could be biased or unreliable information if the ratio wasn\u2019t close to equal. I think they should have done a counter survey to see which terms people of different ethnicities would prefer to be called. With that kind of information we could see the differences and make comments about how they differ and which terms are more comfortable for a person of different ethnicity. I do think using general terms to someone of different ethnicity could be disrespectful in some situations, because if someone is not the ethnicity you assumed, you just called them something they weren\u2019t and that's disrespectful.

I can understand one not saying Latinx because they don\u2019t fully know what it means and are fearful of being hammered for being incorrect.

Although this graph is about race, an age-old concept, many of the terms didn\u2019t exist until now and are just starting to be used more often. As the world has become more culturally and racially inclusive, we have also realized that maybe some of these phrases are too wide-ranging. Although the newer terms, such as \u201cLatinx\u201d and \u201cBIPOC\u201d haven\u2019t gained a ton of popularity yet, they are starting to catch on. I think this is a good thing for the world because it emphasizes smaller groups within larger ethnic groups. Some of these people may have previously been underrepresented and giving them a specific name can help give them the recognition that they deserve. I also think that sometimes people will use the broader terms, like \u201cAsian\u201d or \u201cHispanic\u201d at times when it may be more appropriate to use a more particular term.

I\u2019d never heard of it before and it made me wonder why people seem to dislike it so much. I understand the context behind why it was made, to be a gender neutral alternative to Latino/Latina, and I guess since nonbinary people are a minority it would make sense why most people prefer not to use it. It reminded me of the term \u201cWomxn\u201d which was made as a gender neutral alternative to the word \u201cWoman\u201d but isn\u2019t nearly as inclusive as people act like it is. Although it claims to be more inclusive of trans women, the label just treats them like they\u2019re not real women by making a specific term to separate them from other women. This reminded me of how, in my community (LGBTQ+), there\u2019s often a lot of controversy about what labels or pride flags are outdated and appropriate to use. For example, the progress pride flag was made to highlight trans and POC queer people, but some people don\u2019t like that they\u2019re highlighted in that design because it makes it seem like they weren\u2019t included in the original rainbow flag. The trend I notice on this graph is that most people prefer more general terms like \u201cAsian\u201d rather than \u201cA.A.P.I.\u201d probably because the newer terms that are made to be more inclusive tend to make the people they\u2019re trying to include only feel more isolated.

I think this is because people are not aware of the meanings of terms like A.A.P.I. or Latinx. I'm curious on why such a large groups aren't educated on different races and minorities. I wonder what the percentages would look like if the education system would teach more in-depth on abbreviations and different references to races. Knowing the correct terms and just being educated in general about someone's ethnicity can be really important. It helps us understand different perspectives of the world and where we originated from.",

The incorporation of these new terms to refer to ethnic groups that are inclusive like Latinx that doesn't strictly bind the person to gender is a good turn for the time as Gender is not only male and female and I would predict that percentage will grow in a few years to help with respect when referring to specific people. It's extremely amusing that many individuals might not even understand what terms like AAPI, LatinX, or BiPoc imply. It took me looking them up to realize when these terms demand respect when referring to a person.\n2. I'm curious as to why Latino/Latina is used less frequently than Hispanic, despite the fact that the only distinction between the two terms is how the male and feminine pronouns are assigned to the word. Also, I've never heard of the terms A.A.P.I. or BIPOC, but after some research, I learned that they stand for \"Asian American/Pacific Islander\" and \"Black Indigenous Person of Color\". I'm curious whether the Americans who claimed they didn't use those terms did so because they, like me, had never heard of them or for some other purpose.\n3. This relates to my community and me because being a Peruvian woman as well as my family being from South America, we are considered Latino and Hispanic. I also live in a place where many people from Latin America self-identify as Hispanic or Latino, which is intriguing to contrast with the chart since I have never heard any of my friends identify as Latinx.\n4.

The graph's significance lies in its reflection of the language and attitudes of Americans as a collective group. Depending on one's race, ethnicity, or gender, they may be more or less likely to use certain words. \nMoreover, the graph is relevant to individuals interested in promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, as it sheds light on language habits and preferences of different demographic groups. \nSome questions that the graph may provoke include the factors that influence people's language choices, why certain terms are more common than others, and how language use reflects cultural and social changes over time.

I was told that not all people of African Descent are American, (referring to \"Afro-caribbeans\") and that \"Latinx\" does not fit into the spanish language, as the spanish language is \"built on gendered words.\" These are explanations I have found from a varying amount of people, and it doesn't even scratch the surface.\n\n4.

Using more specific terms like Latinx and Asian American can be good but I think you should know some of the person's background before referring to their label. For example, Latino/Latina are referring to people from Latin America so it would be incorrect to refer to someone from Spain as Latino. The more correct term would be Hispanic. \n    I wonder if people were already more familiar with these terms the statistics would be different. If people correctly educated themselves on these titles then people could correctly refer to a group of people, instead of incorrectly labeling them. It would help make groups more diverse instead of generalizing. For instance, it would be incorrect to say every black person was African American because not every black person has descent from Africa. Many people have descent and traditions from Brazil, Haiti, Columbia, etc.\n     Even though there is a big white population at my school, there are still many POC and my area can be very diverse. People should learn about how to refer to groups of people because it can make people feel more comfortable since POC groups seem to be smaller around me.

One thing I want to talk about is the argument about using pregnant women, birthing parent, chest feeding, and breastfeeding. I feel that terms like breastfeeding should not be removed to be replaced with chest feeding. These terms have been used for women and trying to take these terms for women away is wrong. I do think when talking about nonbinary people and trans men these terms are great. Trans men should be accepted and normal in being able to have children of their own, but I disagree with getting rid of terms like breastfeeding altogether because it is getting rid of the idea of motherhood. Overall there are more women that are giving birth than non-women people giving birth.\n     Another term I find very offensive is \"illegal alien\". This term should never be accepted even if the person isn't trying to be offensive. It makes immigrants, especially ones that are undocumented, look alienated and when people talk about them it can make people look racist, even if they think they aren't.  People should just use immigrant or undocumented immigrant when referring to them.",

I definitely see how careless it can be to call someone \"nonwhite\" or \"Black\", not only because you might not know their ethnicity, but because how antique those words are. I say antique because those words are truly outdated, and wouldn't be a regular thing to call someone.\n          I do believe that it's very important to find out what a person is comfortable with being called, because ethnicity and race are two different things. I can see that the surveyed group who used terms like \"nonwhite\" might have been influenced wrongly from their parents or media. I also see that a huge percentage of the surveyed group are most comfortable with terms like \"Hispanic\" and \"Asian\", which are also common terms I hear around my community.\n           Research is an important tool to use if you are in the topic of race and ethnicity. You never know how calling someone one of these terms can effect how you are viewed. This might be why some of the people surveyed used terms such as \"BIPOC\" and \"AAPI\". It could be because they might be afraid to use a wrong term, or because they prefer to use a newer and thoughtful term.

For example, according to the Journal of Hispanic Higher Education, the first instance of the term Latinx in academic literature was in 2013. This means that the word has not really had much time to catch on to the general populace. Another example would be the term A.A.P.I, which I had never heard of. This term was first introduced in the 80s, so is much newer than most of the other terms like Asian American, or Asian. I would guess that the older the term, the more popular it is, and vice versa with younger terms. The main thing I do not understand about this graph is the percentage of people that would not say anything about anyone's race. I would have to guess that they would claim to not see color and so they have nothing to say about it, but I cannot be sure.

Also what I see is that the terms that are the most used are the terms that I see to be least offensive but I can't say anything because I am not a part of any of the mentioned groups. \n     The thing that really got me thinking is that what else would people call these other people?  Seeing that 13% of people wouldn't say the term \"Hispanic\" kind of surprised me. It really got me thinking on the other names for the people mentioned. I thought really hard for about 2 minutes and couldn't think of anything. So I was and still am really curious to see what others call this group of people.\n     Lastly, I thought who in my life calls this group this term or that term. Everyone I have heard reference the first group, I have heard them call them Hispanic and for the second group Asians, for the third, African American, and fourth, person of color. It got me thinking why. Do people use the term they think least offensive or do people use the word they were thought to use. If I were to make the graph, I would call it, \"What would you say?\".",

It is way more appropriate to use \"Hispanic' because you never know where a person came from or what their ethnicity is.

One of the primary things that catch my attention is how less frequently individuals use the words in the bottom group of graphs. This is probably due to the fact that a term like \"nonwhite\" connotes negativity and is not the most courteous. Yet, 77% of persons claim to use the terms \"African American\" and 69% claim to use the word \"Asian American.\" In addition to being precise, these words promote inclusion. Just 13% of respondents said they would not use the term \"Hispanic,\" which has the highest usage rate. I'm curious about the demographics of this survey.",

The terms that are not commonly used in the media are all under 35%. The data tells me that the participants had 2-3 words they could choose from. A lot of the terms are very vague and widely used to talk about a big group of people so yeah that term would win, even if the other terms are better to describe, they are just not widely known enough. \n \t\tA percentage that stood out to me is that  87% out of 4,423 people said that they use the term Hispanic. The next closest answer is Latina with 70%. This data told me that most people are comfortable enough to use both of those terms\n       I think a way to get a better and more honest result is to change the survey from \u201cwould you say this word\u201d to what word would you use.

I don't agree with using those terms for one it doesn't even make sense, 2 people can be the same color but completely different ethnicity's. Saying nonwhite just makes it seem like any other race besides white is inferiors and is all classified as one. \nI think most of the terms that were used for the chart are pretty common and I think adding more terms and asking more people would help get a more accurate representation on what terms people actually use. Or maybe not even listing terms at all and just asking without giving options would get more of an honest opinion. \nI have never heard anyone use the terms BIPOC, A.A.P.I., or Latinx before so the fact that the percentages were all over 20% with the amount of people that were asked surprised me. I wonder where the people that use those terms grew up and how they were taught about those three terms. \nThe people in my community from what I hear use the most common terms the like African American, black, and Asian although I do hear a lot of people use the term Mexican instead of Hispanic which I don't agree with because if you are Mexican that means you're from Mexico and you can still be Hispanic just from different country's so I think Hispanic would be more appropriate for the overall use.",

This relates to me and my community because in the latino community, not everyone has gotten used to the word \"Latinx\" since it is somewhat new. Seeing this graph lets me see that many others aren't accepting of that term. But, since I live in a diverse community, this graph allows me to see a piece of what people would see as an approrpriate term to call someone without offending. \n\n4. \"Watching What You Say: Could Certain Terms be Offensive?\"",

In contrast, the most agreed upon term is Hispanic with 87% of the people asked saying they use it. It seems that most of the Americans that were questioned stick to more of the older sayings such as Hispanic, Asian/Asian American, and Black/African American and are much less familiar and/or uncomfortable with using the other terms, given the percentages of each of the terms.\n\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why Latino/Latina is used by less of the people asked than Hispanic is considering they\u2019re almost the same and the only difference is the assigning of the masculine and feminine in the words. I\u2019ve also never heard of A.A.P.I. or BIPOC and after doing some research I found that they mean \u201cAsian American/Pacific Islander\u201d and \u201cBlack Indigenous Person of Color\u201d respectively.

In the first group americans are most likely to use the term Hispanic, in the second group they are most likely to use the term Asian, in the third group they are most likely to use African American. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder what is affecting Americans to use the other terms, does it cancel culture? I wonder if the way these Americans grew up affects the term they use. I also wonder who they surveyed, what age they were, what part of the world they lived in etc. \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to me and my community because I am apart of a generation that really cares about what terms are used to refer to people, I live in a hispanic community and the term that is mainly used here to describe us would be \"hispanic\". \n\n What\u2019s going on in this graph?\nOffensive or Appropriate: What Does Cancel Culture Say?",

In lieu of being accurate and respectful, it is simpler to refer to someone by their conventional name. I believe that the older terminology is still in use since it is clearer and simpler. Although insulting, the terms \"Asian\", \"Black\", and \"Hispanic\" are far simpler to remember and pronounce than \"A.A.P.I\", \"latinX\", and \"BIPOC\".\n2)I'm curious how long it will take for the more recent, precise terminology to become commonplace. If they are used frequently enough, they will eventually overtake the current descriptive phrases and cease to exist. I'm curious as to why \"Black American\" is the only politically correct phrase that has more usage than its opposite.\n3). I would argue that this refers to my community as well as this generation in general since it is getting more objectionable to use terms that were not offensive ten years ago. There is a significant contrast between the terms that some people would say that would be thought to be non-offensive and the language that many people would use that would today be considered to be offensive, especially living in a more progressive area but remaining in the south.\n4)Be careful what you say\u2014what will be considered suitable or offensive?",

It is important to use terms that make people feel comfortable when addressing their race. \n\"Would You Use This?\"",

The exception is between \"African American\" and \"black\", where preference is almost equal. 2) My largest wondering is what causes such a difference in preference, since many terms seem to be much less preferred than the others. 3) This relates to my community because it is diverse, an the people within my community have their own preferences about these terms. 4) What is your preferred identity, and how would you address others?",

Each bar refers to a term and indicates whether a person uses it or does not use it based on the variables \"yes\" and \"no.\" Based on the visual, a majority of the sample uses the terms \"Hispanic\", \"Asian\", and \"African American.\"\n\n\n2. What do you wonder?\n\nI am curious to know what the backgrounds of the people who were surveyed are. Factors, such as age, education, and race, could play a significant role in which terminologies are more commonly used than others.\n\n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\n\nPeople in my community use some of these terms when addressing. This visual is definitely impactful since it indicates what might seem appropriate to say and what might seem offensive to say.\n\n\n\n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\n\nAccording to the graph, terms such as \"Latinx\", \"A.A.P.I\", \"BIPOC\", and \"Nonwhite\" are not commonly used by the Americans surveyed. Less than 40% of the sample use these terms, which might indicate that they might sound offensive to someone. On the other hand, the terms \"Hispanic\", \"Asian\", and \"African American\" are commonly used.

Hispanic, Asian, African American and Person of Color are the most often used words. The least used and most recent comment on the list is Latinx, which refers to all Hispanics. The words with the lowest popularity on the graph are more contemporary expressions that have gained popularity due to racial strife and the expansion of social media. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nIn what ways are terms like Latinx, A.A.P.I., and BIPOC more inclusive for groups who feel they should be referred to in this way? I'm curious where other terminologies like these comes from. Is there a rise in the use of gender-neutral language as society moves closer to a more accepting culture of all genders, nationalities, and other characteristics?\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis applies to my community because there are numerous races represented in my high school, but I was unaware that only a few phrases were used to describe them. For instance, I hear the terms \"Hispanic\" and \"Mexican\" much more frequently than terms like \"Latino\" or a description of the sort of Latino. In contrast, I only hear the word \"Black\" at our school, where there are hundreds of different students of African heritage. It appears that only generic terminology and a very small number of other words or races are recognized. \n\nWhat is going on in the graph?\nWhich of the Modern Generation's Phrases Do You Connect With?",

I notice acronyms such as BIPOC and A.A.P.I. are severely underutilized with 30% and less, present in the graph.\n\n2) Is the 4,423 Americans an accurate representation of the U.S. population as a whole and how the results of the graph would change if possibly more factors or variables were introduced? What was the racial composition of those who responded to the survey and what was the count of each race? What makes some terms more objectionable than others? What would ethnicities prefer in regard to the chart's terms? Why are the more inclusive terms used least commonly?\n\n3) This relates to me and my community because as a Hispanic, the term Latinx feels redundant, replacing conventional Spanish grammar that would normally utilize \"o\" and \"a\" to distinguish between genders with an \"x\". Terms such as A.A.P.I and BIPOC are acronyms so I would understand why they are least commonly used, but it is interesting that society seems to stray from the more inclusive terms in preference for terms more simple and narrow.\n\n4) American Perception of Racial Identity in Simplest Terms",

Is there an increase in the number of people who use gender neutral phrases as society develops toward a more welcoming culture of all genders, ethnicities, and so on? \n3) This is relevant to me and my community since I am a Salvadoran woman, thus I am hispanic and Latina because my family and I are from a Central American nation. I also reside in a town full of individuals from Latin America who identify as Hispanic or Latino, which is fascinating to compare to the chart because I have never heard any of my peers use the word Latinx. \n4)  A New Generation of Terms: Which Do You Identify With?",

There\u2019s an explanation of how to make your own survey in the Reveal that is released by Friday.  You could use the terms here plus include other questions.  \n\nWho would you survey?  How many people would you survey?  How would you make it confidential?  Which demographic characteristics would you want to collect from your respondents to best determine who uses and who does not use terms?  \n\nIt takes a lot of effort to design a survey, but the survey should give you insights in how people speak about each other.",

It appears that within races, there is always a word people prefer to say over others. This can also be seen in the Asian race with \"Asian\" at 81% and \"A.A.P.I\" at 27%. I wonder why people aren't more inclusive on phrases and words as they begin to become more prevalent in our lives. The words \"Person of color\" and \"BIPOC\" are brought up more and more throughout our daily lives, yet less than 50% would use those words. I don't understand why because they aren't harmful words, etc. This relates to my community because in my high school we have hundreds of different races, but I never noticed there were only select words used. For example, I hear \"Hispanic\" or \"Mexican\" a lot more than other words like \"Latino\" or specifying the type of latino. On the other hand, there are hundred of different kids of African descent at our school, and all I hear is \"Black\". It seems like there are just very few recognition of other words or races and only generalized terms. This graph shows the percent of Americans who say or don't say specific \"race words\".",

    "comment info": "1. Americans are least likely to use the terms Latinx, A.A.P.I., and BIPOC. The most common words are Hispanic, Asian, African American, and Person of Color. Latinx, which is intended to include all Latinos, is the least frequently used and newest word in the list. The least popular words on the graph are more recent expressions that have gained attention due to racial unrest and the growth of social media. This could explain why other terms are more commonly used than these ones, particularly the way America defines races and ethnicities.\n\n2. Why aren't the most inclusive words used more frequently? Is this because the terms are still so new and the majority of people still don't understand them? A.A.P.I. is also much less common than the more straightforward term Asian, whereas both black terms for black people are much closer to what Americans would say when compared to any other race. Maybe because there are as many black Americans as there are white Americans.\n\n3. In relation to my community, I can also understand why some of the terms selected are used more frequently than others. Being Latina, I could also comprehend why the term \"Latinx\" isn't used more often. This is because it is the most recent and, in my opinion, is not as necessary as people think since the term \"Latino,\" despite being a masculine word, can be used broadly to describe anyone of Latin ancestry.\n\n4. \"POC or BIPOC?
