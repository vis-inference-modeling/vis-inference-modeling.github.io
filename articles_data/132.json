This creates an impression that choosing three languages is equivalent to selecting three skills, while the other options represent only one skill. To make this question fair, I suggest changing the language option to \"one language of your choice\" so that it does not stand out for being quantified.",

I am multilingual so I know this would help you in getting a job. It is also fun to know more than one language because you could read books or watch shows in other languages and when you travel you wouldn't have a language barrier.\n4.

You don't seem to surprise when seeing gymnastics on the top 6 of all skills people want to master but rather ask why not many more chose that option. Your answer to what you wonder is also interesting as it questions the credibility and factors behind the answers of the people doing the survey. One thing your answer makes me wonder is whether this is a survey where you can only pick from the options they give like a multiple-choice or whether it is a survey where you can list the skill you want to master.

There does seem to be an overwhelming favor of more \"white collar,\" higher paying jobs, as language fluency and neuroscience would both lead to higher salaries.\n\nI wonder why these were the options. Oil painting seems like a very specific activity, compared to maybe just asking the students if they would want to master just painting. Also, I am curious to see if the students were searching for the \"correct\" answer or if maybe there was a bias in the polling, as different nationalities or classes might prioritize different skills. As those who participated were subscribers to the New York Times, they might be more interested in more academic activities verses those relating to art, physical education, or home maintenance.\n\nThese graph shows what skills high schoolers value, hinting on what classes they will take, degrees they will obtain, and eventually what the job market and the workforce will look like.\n\n\"A White Collar Future: America's Upcoming Workforce.\"",

I wonder what languages people would choose to master if they had to pick three. Would their choice have been different if the languages were predetermined, or did they have specific languages in mind that appeal to them in some way? I think that if everyone was required to learn a second language in schools, we would be able to communicate with a larger group of people, and be more well-rounded in everyday life. A headline for this could be \"Instant Skills, Without the Practice\".",

Directly right after follows 12% of people who said that they would prefer mastering chef skills, and then 11% with neuroscience mastery. \n2. I wonder as to why the gap between mastering three languages and the rest of the skills varies by such a large amount. The difference between 60% and 12% is 48%. I think that this could be because people are just generally interested in immersing themselves in a rich culture that is not their own. Language is the key to understanding people who do not look like you, and great for making connections between one another. \n3. The impact that this would have is having a greater understanding and appreciation for the different cultures that exist in my community. I think that it is so important to understand at least another language because English is not the only language out there with a large amount of speakers.  It would be great to fully understand our differences and how we can make each other smile with the words that we can speak. \n4. In this graph, we get to see the percentages of people who selected a specific skill to instantly master. Catchy headline: \"US Priority: To Cook or to Speak?\"",

Our group noticed that there was an abundance of people who would instantly master the skill of knowing three languages of their choice. The graph indicates that 60% of people would want to obtain this skill and the other 40% would prefer to master a different skill. Additionally, our team wonders what three languages the people in the survey would have loved to master. We were also curious why these topics were chosen. Doing gymnastics, mastering languages, repairing home items, etc.. is all very particular and we wonder if there would have been more participants if the topics were more relatable. This impacts our community because most of these skills are basic everyday skills that everyone should learn eventually.

Of course, giving people completing the survey unlimited options for possible skills would make it difficult to organize responses in a meaningful way, it should be recognized that changing the options for skills could drastically affect the results of the survey. I notice that many of the skills all require a significant time commitment. I wonder if perhaps the survey takers chose the skills because of the time investment they would require. I also wonder if the skills chosen reflect how the survey takers spend their free time (those who chose chef skills having an interest in baking, for example.) This graph could affect my community by showing what skills those in my community will be most likely to invest time in (though of course the results would be more accurate to my community if the survey was conducted entirely inside of it.)

I need to understand the fact that people would rather learn different languages than being able to repair things, being able to cook, being able to draw interesting paintings or show some sort of creativity, and etc. All of these master skills take a lot intellect and energy and all will be able to help in some way. Being able to learn multiple languages will help in workplaces to communicate with those from foreign places or as you say immigrants. The ability to understand everyone needs in a certain time and area helps less complicate things for yourself an others. It is already a hard time for those who come from different languages to be able to catch up to our speed meaning learning English and american lifestyle. I feel like being able to learn three languages would be a good thing to master. I wonder why do the people that would rather learn the other master instead of the learning multiple languages. The impact this would have on me is that it will help me communicate with more of those who are of Hispanic descent because that is usually what I'm around.

Additionally, a group of people wanted to be proficient in neuroscience over learning how to repair household items, and a seperate group wanted to learn to oil paint over than learning to cook. I wonder what the percentage of people who would rather sculpt or be proficient in a trade would be. I also wonder what a graph, over the course of 50 years showing what people wanted to waster would look like. This has an effect on the funding each department of the shown skill get. If most people go to language than go to gymnastics, they should give more funding to language departments because the money will be used to help a larger number of people, than if they gave the same amount of money to a smaller department, like gymnastics, because it would help less people.

I also notice that the most useful ones have the largest percentages, down to the perhaps more fun ones but less useful. \n- I wonder why these specific skills were chosen as the options. Why neuroscience? Why gymnastics? Why three languages?\n-  I wonder what a persons choice says about them. 60% of people chose to instantly know three languages, which could maybe tell us that most of us are more practical.",

Compared to the advantages these skills offer, it is absolutely right that acquiring three language of our choice are most beneficial then each of them. \n\u2022\tWhat do you wonder? \no\tWhy should they put three language of your choice in the first place? It will definitely win among the other skills. Mastering one language only will be comparable with the other, but not three.\n\u2022\tWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\no\tThis reflect the necessity of our community to have the ability in many languages. Learning language is still a necessary skill, because it brings us closer to the other community all over the world despite the emergence of translation applications online.\n\u2022\tWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?
