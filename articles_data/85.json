The graph has separated these opinions is weird ways. There is an overall collum, as well as a men and women. Women till this day don't have the ability to speak their mind because of some men. Republicans and Democrats are also separated, maybe this is why most of the people that follow these two parties can't see eye to eye on things for our country. Lastly young adults and senior citizen (65+) have around the same percentage of beliefs on freedom of speech. \n-I wonder why it is that these specific categories were separated on how much they believe freedom of speech is to some Americans? Maybe this is the reason why there is a problem with freedom of speech here in America because we keep separating into the same categories that cause problems. That this is a mens world, that men are superior than women, that not only men can do this job. Or the Republicans are right/wrong, no Democrats are right/wrong. So I wonder how many more Americans feel like this is the reason why we still have the problem of freedom of speech. \n-This has an impact on me and the community because the world would be much more simple if we as a whole had the strength to speak what is on our mind.

I find it interesting how the men have a greater number of \"not at all serious\" and \"not very serious\"\nresponses than the women, but also have a greater number of \"very serious\" responses than the women as\nwell.\n2. First off, I wonder why they chose to focus on this topic. Since it seems focused on a particular concept\nwithin the subject of free speech, I wonder why they didn't include more specific categories. For one, it\nwould make sense if they included more intersections, such as Black women, Asian men, etc. I think\nincluding views of minorities who have to regularly censor themselves in fear of retaliation would be\nmore meaningful and useful data.\n3. Personally, I think it is an issue that Americans do not exercise their freedom of speech in everyday\nsituations in fear of retaliation or harsh criticism, but in the context of them needing to do it for their own\nsurvival. For minorities, censorship is something that many people unfortunately have to do, and have to\ncode switch and adjust to a eurocentric standard.

I also noticed that almost every category had very similar responses. For example, the very serious category was in the 30-40 percent range and the somewhat serious category was in the 40-50 range. I noticed that men and democrats seemed to have the least amount of concern for free speech. I wonder how many people were in each group. Were there more Democrat responses taken than Republican responses? I wonder how the results could be 100% accurate if the groups could not actually be divided equally due to the number of respondents and groups. This relates to me and my community because there are many debates about free speech and protests are a common occurrence in our world today. A good title for this graph could be: Free? Speech",

We wonder why more men believe retaliation or criticism for being able to use your first amendment right doesn\u2019t matter as much as women believe it does.

The population of interest in this graph is American, and the sampling methods used are US residents who are men, women, democrats, and republicans all aged 18-34 and 65+. The impact this has on society is that our right of freedom of speech is getting compromised and that the younger generation of people are afraid to exercise their right of freedom of speech. This impacts our society because most of the population of our society is afraid to use their right of freedom of speech in fear of retaliation.\nOur title: Is freedom of speech still free?",

Within that, Democrats and Americans aged 18-34 are both the highest groups that believe this issue is somewhat serious. Conversely, Democrats have the lowest amount of individuals who think it is very serious. One thing that makes sense to me is that women were one of the highest groups of people who think it is somewhat serious and very serious. I think that this is due to a number of factors. Many women experience sexism & discrimination regularly in their everyday lives, and oftentimes probably hold back on what they really want to say in order to be safe. This is reinforced when you look at the male groups, who have the lowest numbers in both categories, which makes sense since they don't experience the same problems as women. Another thing that I noticed was that more Republicans believe that not exercising their freedom of speech out of fear was considered more serious than Democrats, even though the numbers are opposite for the somewhat serious category.\n\nI wonder what the threshold is for something that is considered \"very serious\" versus \"somewhat serious.\" Moreover, what are the demographics of race, ethnicity, and where they live? This dramatically affects the results.\n\nThis affects me and my community because I deserve to live my life being able to say what I want without criticism.",

I wonder why this is, and what societal factors might make younger people feel more intimidated to use their free speech than older people.

However, it seems relatively even for all categories with only a few percent differences between each. I wonder why men care more than women about this issue as well as how age could affect this issue. A guess as to why younger people see the freedom of speech as a larger issue could be because younger people are more intimidated by older people and therefore too scared to speak out.

We also notice that the distribution is pretty even. We are wondering why men care more than women. We also wonder how big of a problem this is in real life or if this is more of a hypothetical. We also wonder how different the graph would look if the age category was also separated by politics, and the gender categories by age / politics. The populations of interests are men and women, and they were separated based on political identity and age. Sienne college collected the data with a poll. They asked 1,507 people over 18. Freedom of speech is very important because it protects you from the government. People being afraid to speak to avoid \"retaliation or harsh criticism\" is bad because everyone should be able to voice their opinions as long as it doesn't hurt other people. A headline we came up is \"Survey results for how important is free speech\".",

Democrats don't take free speech very seriously as compared to the rest of the data. Men take free speech the most seriously through the graph.

I notice that the biggest category of people that say this is a very serious problem is men and on the contrary the categories that argue it's not serous at all is women and democrats. \nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder what affect a persons gender, age, or political affiliation has to do with how they answer this question? After seeing that men find this to be the most serious problem out of all of the categories I think about the concept of toxic masculinity. Are men afraid to exercise their freedom of speech because it may not agree with the societal norms of what a man should believe?\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to me and my community for I am an American citizen blessed with the freedom of speech.

Sienna states that there is a margin of error in this poll of 3.1%.  We do not know if this is the MOE only for the overall statistics or for all of the subgroups.  (Simply, the margin of error is the amount of difference that could occur among random samples.)  Let\u2019s assume that 3.1 % MOE is for all subgroups.  Since the difference between the Republican and Democrat response for the categories of somewhat and very serious combined is 3%, then it is possible that there is no difference between these two subgroups.  The difference is due to variations in samples.  Alternatively, there is a 7% difference between 18-34 and 65+ year olds and a 5% difference between women and men.   \n\nNow, what do you notice and wonder?",

    "comment info": "What's Going on in this Graph? - Free Speech\n\nThe four ratings for how much of a problem not exercising freedom of speech is are not at all serious, not very serious, somewhat serious, and very serious. The specific categories the responses are broken up into are men, women, democrats, republicans, ages 18-34, and ages 65+. Overall, 44% responded \u201csomewhat serious\u201d and 40% responded \u201cvery serious\u201d. In all the categories \u201csomewhat serious\u201d or \u201cvery serious\u201d are the largest response. \nI wonder why ages 35-64 are not included as an age category. There tends to be more interest in what younger people think versus what older people think, but what about all the people in between those age categories? I wonder if the categories men and women are referring to sex or gender, because if it is referring to gender there is another missing category of people. I wonder why Democrats is the category with the smallest percentage of \u201cvery serious\u201d.\nI would say that Americans being afraid to exercise freedom of speech in everyday situations is a somewhat serious problem. Politics and social issues are so contentious that probably everyone is afraid of saying something too controversial to their peers.\n\u201cAre people not using their freedom of speech?\u201d",
