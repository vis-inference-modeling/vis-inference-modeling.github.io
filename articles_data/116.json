I notice that jobs in the medical field increased in projection the most, probably due to the reason that more people are required due to Covid-19 to nurse the infected and find some form of a cure or vaccine. Jobs that are done online also increased in projection because they can be done from home. Inversely, jobs that require physical interaction decreased in projection drastically.\n\n2.

I wonder what would happen to the occupations that will be in a much higher demand; will it be much harder to able to get a position in that job category? or will it stay the same? The impact that this would have on my community would be that it can be extrememly discouraging for others who also want a job that's in the higher demand category, and the jobs in less demand would be run completely by teenagers seeking money for various of reasons.

Jobs related to the medical field and the prevention of diseases such as epidemiology, biochemists, and microbiologists have increased. The next thing I noticed was the types of jobs that are less in demand. These jobs were more related to close contact with others and essential jobs, such as mass transit, hotel clerks, and waiters. This may be because of the large amount of stress put on these workers due to the pandemic, making the industries seem much less appealing. I also noticed that web developers are in higher demand, as the progression of modern technology in society requires more of these skills.

I also noticed that jobs that require people to be in person are experiencing a tremendous decline in demand. I wonder if this is because people are beginning to realize that working remotely from home can often be more efficient and easier compared to certain environments where they would traditionally be. One impact this can have on my community is a decrease in jobs for people. For example, many people in my community work jobs as waiters, cashiers, bartenders, and more; however, if there is a decrease in demand in these types of jobs, these same people will begin to lose their jobs and have to work elsewhere which can have a harmful effect on them.

All jobs on the top half section of the graph show massive increases, whereas the lower half will be experiencing major decreases. I have mixed feelings when I see statistics like this, since I understand not all workers desire to pursue STEM careers. Service jobs are essentially the backbone of modern society, and this decline in them can only mean one thing, and that it is not the jobs that are going away, but the people who perform them. Throughout the pandemic we have all noticed how quick companies were to adjust the function of their services to allow for business to thrive while following CDC guidelines. Where a lot of companies turned to computers and robots to perform tasks normally done by humans. Many of the service jobs on the list consist precisely of those jobs I have seen done by a computer at least once. Knowledge intensive jobs such as the ones on the top half of the graph are very encouraging to see, as they mean our society is progressing rapidly in terms of knowledge and technology.

I wonder if this information will lead some people to pursue one career over another, or if many will continue to follow their original plan regardless of the data presented here. Similarly, I wonder how working from home will impact other careers, and if some jobs will become obsolete because they can be done at home instead.\n\nThe information presented here directly impacts my surrounding community. Many other students have expressed an increased interest in becoming doctors or healthcare workers in the future. There is also an increased need for these workers in the area.\n\nA catchy headline for this graph could be: How will the Pandemic Impact Your Future Job?",

I wonder whether this occurred due to the fact that most of these careers contribute to reducing the effect of the widespread pandemic we are currently living in. For example, epidemiologists seem to be higher in demand than all of the careers depicted on the graph because they are tasked with identifying patterns and causes of disease. Furthermore, I also noticed that careers in relation to customer service such as bartenders or waiters/waitresses seemed to have decreased in demand.\n\nThis could either adversely or positively affect my community since I myself have both medical professionals in my neighborhood and family who would benefit from the effects of the pandemic, as well as people working in customer service who are no longer needed as much since there are less people going out in public places than ever before.\n\nOne possible title for this graph could be \"How Has the Pandemic Impacted Your Career?\" since the graph shows an array of jobs that the audience may have themselves, or may know of someone who works in one of these fields as well.",

Epidemiologists are expected to increase the most with a projection of +25.3%. I wonder if this is because many computerized jobs can be done at home. Jobs that involve being \"hands-on\" and involving being in person and in public are projected to decrease. I wonder if this has to do with the fact that these workers were the first to lose their jobs in the pandemic. Hosts and hostesses, restaurant, lounge and coffee shop jobs are the most negatively impacted with a projection of -24.2%. I wonder how this graph compares to the one made before the pandemic happened and how it compares to the \"moderate-impact scenario.\" I also wonder what will happen to these fields of jobs in the future. \n\nThis impacts me and my community because many students have \"hands-on\" jobs and use them to pay for college. Many people who can't afford higher education also rely on these jobs to provide an income. Additionally, many local restaurants.

Can their current skills be used in the technology/medical field or will they have to attend school or obtain some sort of training to find a more stable job?\n\nI'm planning to major in computer science so I was pretty excited when I initially saw this graph.

These projected changes are what they say they are: projected, meaning it is not a guaranteed thing to occur, but, based on mathematical models using current data, could possibly happen, especially in using this \"strong-impact scenario\".   We should always consider key words in reports, like in this story: \"How MIGHT....\", to realize that, again, these are just projected numbers.  Things can easily change for the better or for the worse over the next ten years.\n\nI believe this information gives students still in school some insight into potential areas of future studies if they want to have more job security later in life.

Due to the shutting down of most facilities in the beginning of the pandemic and then the current day shut downs we have gotten used too, employees of those facilities seem to be listed under the column with a decreased percent after the pandemic. This information effects me and my community because I am almost 17 years old so in a few years I will be entering the workforce looking to start a career and I want to be on the side of this chart where it would be easy opportunities to find a job. This also affects my community because I am surronded by family members with different types of careers and to the best of my knowledge all of their jobs would fall under the increasing percentage side.  \"How secure is your future career going to be post-pandemic?\"",

    "comment info": "\u201cPost Pandemic vs Occupations\u201d\n\nAfter analyzing the graph we noticed that there will be a much greater demand for epidemiologists because they deal with the distribution and control of diseases that could help prevent another pandemic. Science-related fields show the biggest increase in demand post-pandemic. There is more of an overall decrease for certain jobs since they require being surrounded by people in an indoor setting. Public transit-related jobs show a significant decrease because fewer people will feel safe in those situations. We had some questions about the graph such as if the jobs that are currently in low demand will come back after the pandemic if they may go out of business. We wonder if the jobs that are in low demand, such as a restaurant host and a cashier, will be replaced with technology or robots someday. We also wonder if the small businesses that were struggling will be able to thrive after the pandemic is over. This impacts our community because it makes it harder to get jobs that do not require a lot of training or education. This leaves people in our community unemployed and struggling with finances. Also, Those who can\u2019t afford a high education rely on cashier or waitress jobs, but these jobs are in low demand right now.",

The demand for workers in service sectors, including flight attendants, waiters and waitresses, and cashiers, has gone down significantly. Based on this data, we wonder, once the economy opens up, will the need for technology based companies decrease, or remain the same? Has Covid-19 heightened our need for communication via the internet? Additionally, how have the projections compared to what has actually happened? Lastly, we wonder if businesses will continue to proceed with any adaptations made to job demand even after the pandemic is long gone? The impact this change of demand has is that some groups of professions are losing jobs while others are hiring more. Because of the sudden loss of jobs, the economy declined. This decline in certain job markets has the potential to destabilize the economy and hurt many working class families.\nHeadline: \u201cIs your job safe?: Career demand after the pandemic\u201d",

I can see that the highest increase is in epidemiology, which makes sense because we are in a pandemic. The increased jobs that come after it are also in the medical field, biochemistry, and data analyzers, and biomedical technicians. I can see that what might decrease over time are jobs in retail, restaurants, and other in-person jobs. I wonder as to why it is that we see this trend. My assumptions are that the current pandemic really took a toll on how we are living now -- it has become the norm that people stay at home and work in addition to students learning from home as well. This narrative defeats the purpose of having office buildings and schools because what was once done in person can be also done at home. This reasoning might be the reason why we see these trends. The impact that this has on me and my community is that it makes it a lot harder to look towards a positive and pre-covid future because of how long we've been in a pandemic. I feel like in my community we might start seeing less people working in offices when the same jobs can be done at home.

Additionally, service industry jobs like waiters and flight attendants are on the decline.\n\n2. I wonder if this growth project will be a continued trend going forward? Will we have more pandemics as a result of our interconnected world? Or maybe when the pandemic ends there will be a decline in the healthcare industry.\n\n3. This affects me because I would like to work in the medical industry when I grow up and if the medical job market is on the decline then it might make it difficult to find employment.\n\n4. Pandemic Pandemonium will shift the future of our job market",

Considering our area has a lot of restaurants, especially small ones (not chains) so it's scary for them, since if they close, they are done.\n\n\nMain idea: Medical and biology jobs are taking over!\nNot very original, I know, but that's just what I thought of.",

These jobs range from epidemiologists, database administrators, and architects, to bartenders and subway operators. All these jobs are known to be some of the most popular jobs people have today. But, with how quickly the pandemic came about, a lot of the jobs and the companies that own them suffered immensely. \nI noticed\n-One of the most common jobs among young adults, will most likely suffer to gain employees in the future.\n-Epidemiologists are most likely to have the biggest surge of employees, most likely due to the fear of another pandemic.\n-Many essential jobs, especially in the foodservice and transportation field will be suffering the most when it comes to finding potential employees.\nI wonder\n-I wonder how the NYT would be able to get all of this information. Do they ask people employed in these positions already if they would be coming back once everything gets back to normal? Do they ask unbiased and random people?\n-I wonder why the host/hostess job is suffering the most? Is it because of the way they have been treated by customers who are unwilling to wear their masks properly? Do they feel their job is too different or is it's too stressful to continue to work?\nI think a good title for this graph would be \n\"Where will you be needed in 10 years?\"",

This could change the way work and school looks forever. \n- I noticed jobs as flight attendants, restaurant owners, hotel hosts, and bartenders will have decreased as the pandemic has destroyed many of these businesses because those employees are not essential workers. \n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\n- The pandemic has definitely impacted the youth because we\u2019ve seen how it has destroyed so many businesses and put people out of work, so as students, we want the most reliable jobs as possible that will guarantee us a comfortable living if another pandemic does hit. We want to be essentially workers, basically. \n\nCatchy headline:\n\u201cThe Majority of Today\u2019s Youth Might Be Essential Workers\u201d",

    "comment info": "I noticed that jobs related to STEM have surged in the strong impact scenario while jobs in the service sector have greatly fallen. The general trend appears to follow the COVID health guidelines. For example, the CDC doesn't recommend travel for recreation right now, which explains why the reservation and transportation ticket agents and travel checks industry has negative job loss instead of growth. I wonder how dependant this perspective data is on COVID restrictions. For instance, if the future is not reflective of a strong impact scenario, will cashiers still have a similar percent of job loss caused by something else, like businesses preferring technology (self-checkouts) because of preferable costs? This will impact the composition of jobs among industries that make up the job market in totality. For example, if there are fewer available employment opportunities for bartenders those individuals will have to find a job in another industry. This could have an interesting impact on educational attainment levels. Individuals who were bartenders but are now unemployed may choose to go to school to become web developers or database administrators. This could have an interesting secondary impact on political demographics, as education level is a primary indicator of voting behavior. \nCatchy Headline: \"Back to the Future: will the job market ever recover?\"",
