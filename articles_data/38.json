I notice that by 2050, Africa is projected to have the highest percentage of young people (35%). In human geography, we discussed how many countries of Africa have expansive population pyramids which means their population is young and growing. This is because most of these countries are developing countries which means they have not achieved a significant degree of industrialization relative to their populations, and have, in most cases, a medium to low standard of living. They lack access to education, especially for women, and they lack access to contraceptives/family planning. Therefore, women are getting married very young and having many kids. Additionally, having children in countries like Africa can be helpful because they can work for the family. On the other hand, I noticed that in 2050 Northern America will have the lowest percentage of young people (3.5%). This is most likely because of the cost of having children in the developed countries of North America. Since it costs so much, people are going to stop having as many children because they cannot afford it. Finally, I noticed that Eastern and Southeastern Asia suffered a dramatic decline in young people between the years 2023 and 2050. This is because countries like China and Japan have an aging population. Especially with China's one-child rule, the younger population will shrink. PT.2",

On the other hand, other continents and areas of the world will decrease in 2050 from obtaining their current population of 15 to 24 year-olds. This includes Southern Asia (with the highest 15-24 age population in 2030), Eastern and Southeastern Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe, Western Asia, and North America. Therefore, Africa will experience a rise in young populations in the coming decades. I wonder how countries will respond to the following data. Particularly in North and South Korea, China and Japan, the population continues to significantly shrink which will cause significant issues concerning the future of the nations.

The government in Africa has been corrupt in many, if not all, recognized countries within the continent, making it easy to stay away from them for immigration purposes. The increase in the youth population is more than likely because of the health conditions on each continent. As seen per the graph, Asia overall takes the largest dive in population growth, contributed mainly by the fact that Asia has the worst air quality and a significantly low birth rate. Struggling with pollution and a significant lack of resources, Asia seems to be the only continent steadily declining in its living environment as a desirable living place. With pollution kept in mind, Africa is by far the least industrialized continent in the world. As overpopulation ensues, Africa will make for a great alternative as it makes up ~20% of the world's land mass, meaning there is plenty of space for immigration and development, as it has generally gone unused.",

In contrast, the rest of the world is predicted to have a slight decline in population. This growth presents both advantages and difficulties. On one hand, it fosters greater diversity within the population. Moreover, the stability of other regions indicates societal stability and less need for extensive future planning due to resource loss. However, Africa encounters challenges like overcrowding and a severe lack of resources. The inadequate infrastructure in Africa raises concerns about sustaining the expanding population, potentially leading to starvation and higher mortality rates. Additionally, the population surge may result in a decrease in job availability, with certain sectors becoming oversaturated. This could lead to lower wages and an increase in homelessness. Observing the data, I questioned Africa's ability to manage this substantial population growth. The graph is relevant to the global community as it demonstrates the projected population shifts in the coming years.

There is only so much one continent can hold, especially still making sure it's enough to have resources for all the people in there. If there is going to be a continuous rise of people from Africa and a decrease of people in other continents it's going to allow more people from Africa to possibly live in. Another issue is the over population that we have, the continuous rise of the Africa population may cause a major issue with that. This may also lead to other major issues that we might have to face in the future.",

Eastern and Southeastern Asia will have the largest drop-- from 24% to 17%. Interestingly, 15 to 24 years olds will increase in Africa (23% to 35%) and Western Asia (4% to 4.4%).\n\nI wonder if Eastern Asia will have a smaller younger population because of the effects of One Child Policy. I also wonder if Africa will have more young people due to increased access to healthcare, which would limit infant mortality. Lastly, I am curious if countries' share of the global population aged 15 to 24 is indicative of future population size? Will those with a higher a younger population experience more growth?\n\nThis effects me and my community because the redistribution of young people will have influence the demographics of my country.

I wonder if a region's policies such as maternity leave plays a part in a region's population rate, or if how that region is doing economically has an effect. This chart showcases that the population of aged 15 to 24 is expected to decrease across the world in most places, and that we are heading towards a decline in population size. It also shows that people are having less children than before, thus causing the population size to decrease. For the world community this means that there will be less younger people in the workforce to replace the retirees, and less younger people to take care of the elderly. This can already be seen in Japan where their population has been decreasing for a while now, and is still expected to decline even more. I think economically this decrease in the younger population will harm the economy, because there will be less consumers, and companies might even have to adjust who they market towards.",

The graph suggests that 35% of the world\u2019s youth will reside in Africa, which seems to coincide with that continent\u2019s broader development as many countries there begin to transform into modern societies. It seems important to note that this graph, however, seems misleading. The implication it delivers is that Africa will experience a population boom of sorts and so its youth population will rise dramatically. This may well be true; however, if one considers that Africa is an entire continent comprising more than 20% of the Earth\u2019s total landmass, the context of this number changes. Indeed, while the graph\u2019s constructors have split up Asia into three separate regions, when one combines these numbers, it becomes evident that the Asian continent will contain 47.4% of the world\u2019s youth population in 2050, the lion\u2019s share. This data is, for whatever reason, hidden in the graph. It seems, furthermore, nonsensical to consider what percentage of the world\u2019s youth such massive continents will hold as it renders the data shallow, as well as reinforcing misguided conceptions of these continents as singular places instead of diverse regions.

Africa will have the highest percent of young people while Northern America will have the least. \n\n\nA few benefits of this shift is that they will be able to know more about the culture in Africa. SInce it is also one of the more visited areas of the world, there will be more interaction between different cultures. A challenge would be the diversity in other parts of the world. They will have as many young people, so it may become a political issue to where their voices are not heard as much as today. \n\n\nI notice that there are many drops and uprising in the graph from places I would not expect. For example, Northern America is dropping, yet I would expect the data to rise. On the other hand, I noticed that the largest jump is Africa, with a 10 percent increase over the next century. \n\n\nWhy is the data shifting so rapidly? \nWhat factors are they using to come up with these predictions? \nWhy is Africa gaining popularity lately?\n\n\nThe world community uses the youth population heavily. For example, new voters, school and the job force.

The projected growth of this age group presents several potential problems regarding fertility and the economy. By looking at this graph it seems like Africa is the only region whose fertility is steadily increasing. I think a common idea among the world's youth is to wait longer before having children  and this could be the very reason the numbers are declining. After looking at this graph I am beginning to wonder if environmental factors are playing a role in the declining fertility rates through the globe.

I think the answer to that question is based on living conditions and access to food and water. These countries will most likely decrease in population if the children are not able to eat or if they have very challenging living conditions. These relate to our world today because most countries that are having trouble with war or harsh living conditions or even just being able to access food and water are not going to want to have baby's or be able to.

Moreover, Southern Asia and Eastern Asia experienced a much more severe decline than other parts of the world. \n\n2.

I wonder if it's simply because of large families with lots of kids or more people moving to the continent in their early adulthood. Furthermore, I wonder why the rest of the world is impacted by such a serious decline. \n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\n\nThis impacts my community because it's vital to look at the effects of an increasingly young population specifically in less developed areas that are more common in the African continent.

A huge reason why is because most cultures have similar views, so having a new view shift so rapidly into the majority may bring some significant changes in what it most outspoken.\nHeadline: Will a Minority Soon be the Majority?",

However, there is also a drastic percent decrease in the global population(aged 15-24) of Southern Asia and Eastern and Southeastern Asia. \n2. I wonder what the colors of the line graph data indicate. Africa\u2019s line is blue, while all the other world regions are orange. Does the blue indicate the region with the greatest percentage change?\n3. This relates to the world community because it is possible an economic and cultural shift will occur. For example, with Africa\u2019s growing population, I strongly believe that the creativity and innovation of its youthful population can play a key role in the continent's economic transformation. Our world will soon be dependent on the young. Thus, the distribution of young people across the world can change our world with their big ideas. \n4. Youngsters!",

By 2050, Africa will be comprised of 35% of the world's young people.\n\n2) I wonder why Africa is the only continent showing an increase in the world's population of young people? What factors have contributed to this unique demographic trend?\n\n3) Since most of the young people will be concentrated in Africa, there will be less young people across the rest of the world. Therefore, in the future, as the current young population ages, the retirement age will increase even further as there won't be as many young hands-- a trend that will occur everywhere except Africa.\n\n4) As The Rest Of The World Ages, Africa Is Becoming Younger",

Since the mean of percentages are relative and affect each other, the percentage change could be because Africa's population of people aged 15 to 24 increased or Southern, Eastern and Southeastern Asia's population of that same age bracket decreased.",
