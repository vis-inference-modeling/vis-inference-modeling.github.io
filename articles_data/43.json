    "comment info": "In this graph, it depicts how the temperatures between the months of January and December have changed from 1850 to 2023. Generally, I noticed that as the years progress, the temperatures drastically rise. For example, in the 1940s-60s, the highest temperature between January and December was around +0.7 degrees celsius, whereas the highest temperature in 2023 was above +1.6 degrees. Each decade, the temperatures become further and further away from the average temperature of below 0 in 1850-1900. I wonder what the main cause of this rise in temperatures is and think that it may be due to climate change because greenhouse gas emissions lead to global warming. Additionally, I noticed that the temperatures for most decades are typically the highest in January, except for the 1970s and 2020s, and I wonder what the cause of this is. Also, I noticed that there is usually a drop in temperature right near December and then it rises again.

Despite the incredible technological advances we have seen in this decade, it looks like there has not been a stopping point for the severe increase in temperature. Additionally, I noticed how the graph depicts the heat in each decade in a different color, each decade's color becoming more red. This noticeable stylistic choice strikes me with fascination, making me ponder about the evident climate change we are witnessing.\nWhy hasn't there been a sense of stability in the climate already? Especially since when you look at the previous decades, the trend of the temperatures increasing has been an evident feature of today's world for a long time so it is strange that there hasn't been a sense of regulation established already. Furthermore, with the severity of the heat depicted in the 2020 decade, I wonder if the effects of that have become even more unavoidable and clear in comparison to the other decades.\nWhether it is humans, animals or plants even, we are being strongly affected by the climb in climate. We have already seen the effects on air quality, endangerment of animals, and lack of snow days. If we continue our lives oblivious to the dangerous increase in temperature, this damage will be almost impossible to reverse.\u00a0\nThis Decade's Hot Topic",

Additionally, I noticed that in general, the decades and years didn't keep the regular seasonal pattern; the winters weren't always shown to be colder than the summers. This is especially true for the 2023 line where the temperature actually peaked in December. This is probably because of the seasonal flip between the northern and southern hemispheres.\u00a0\n\nI wonder how much of this increase in temperature is from human activity and how much is the earth naturally increasing in temperature. Most likely, this large growth is from the peaking industrialization of the world, leading to more fossil fuel consumption and increased greenhouse gas release. I also wonder what could happen in the future if this trend were to continue. Would we find a solution before the earth became completely uninhabitable or insupportable to our current way of life?\u00a0\n\nThis affects my community and the whole world because if temperatures keep rising, eventually life itself will need to make a major change or risk extinction.\u00a0This problem is also not isolated to the distant future because, even if the world does not completely end due to the rise in temperature, it will see a substantial shift for the worse, for example, increasing natural disasters and worse air quality. \n\nTitle: Can't Stop the Heat",

The average temperature for 1850-1900 has risen 1\u00b0C since then. Temperatures in the 20s have not been exceptionally high on a global scale. This may be due to COVID and the COVID recovery years (2021-2022) because it halted many modes of transportation and slowed the economy due to a reduction in manufacturing. These factors can play a role in reducing the temperatures of the world. As we know, fossil fuels produced from transportation and manufacturing are depleting the ozone layer and causing temperatures to rise (global warming). During COVID, studies showed that the ozone layer was healing itself as a result of less carbon emissions going into the air. In 2023, the world was back in full swing. The carbon emissions probably depleted every ounce the ozone layer supposedly healed during COVID following when the restrictions were lifted. In 2023 the ozone layer probably broke down even further resulting in a rise in temperatures. I wonder why temperatures were so high in 2016. This relates to me because it is the dead of winter in NJ and this Saturday is going to be 57\u00b0 Fahrenheit! This is abnormally high for a winter day in the middle of February.

As shown by the graph, the Earth's temperatures have been steadily rising since the 1940s, with 2023 being the hottest year on record. The 1940s-60s were fairly consistent, but still rising. After the 60s, the temperatures continued to increase as global warming increased. I wonder why the temperatures have spiked so significantly in 2023, with it breaking the average pattern. Global warming and climate change have become the forefront issues for the World's health, so I imagine the sudden change can be attributed to the massive increase of waste and trash that has been accumulating the last century coming to fruition. This is an important issue because it relates to every human. I remember when there would be blizzards in October and now it is lucky if we get snow by February. I have noticed the effects of global warming in my daily life now, especially in the last few years.

From the decades recorded, it can be seen that temperatures started to steadily increase around the end of the 1970s going into the 1980s. After such, temperatures appear to climb higher and higher each decade. This leads up to 2023 being the hottest year recorded on the graph. Even though each bar indicating a temperature rise only differs in +0.2\u00b0C, these small increases are linked to grave impacts on the climate of the world. I wonder why 2016 had the most major spike in the 2010s. I understand during this year the Arctic regions experienced uncharacteristic heat and that, globally, oceans were reported to have higher temperatures than normal, resulting in international panic. I also wonder if some of this heat was normal due to natural intervals of the earth heating, but it was untimely coupled with external factors caused by society. This relates to my community because climate change is a major issue. Climate change affects everything from air quality to food. In my local community, there is a strong Environmental Commission that strives to improve the quality of the land and ultimately find ways to rally people together and fight back against climate change.

I wonder if in the future the temperature stops rising, disproving that its linear and making it curved. Can the earth ever get to a point where it stops getting hotter? The increase in temperature over the years affects communities around the world, and its almost prevalent. From the Canadian Wildfires, to the record breaking heatwaves we faceed last year, it would be brainless to not realize this as a problem. Coming back to school and it being 90 degrees until October isn't normal and this graph represents this.\nThe World is Burning!!",

If the trend continues (which it most certainly will), 2024 will take the new record for hottest year. I also notice that from 1850-1900, the average temperature stayed the same, and only started fluctuating at ~1980s (fairly recently), meaning that the amount of damage global warming has on the planet is also increasing.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nIn January of 2016, the average temperature nearly reached the hottest temperature of 2023. What happened during this time that caused the temperature to increase so substantially? How was it able to return back to the average so quickly?\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThe average global temperature is swiftly increasing, meaning we aren\u2019t doing enough to stop or even delay global warming. This graph goes to show that if we can\u2019t come together to enact change now, there will never be a good time. It only will get harder and harder to end global warming, and the point of no return for our Earth is rapidly approaching.\n\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea:\nGlobal Warming or Humanity: Which Will End First?",

From 1850-1900, the temperature decreased while the temperature in 2023 only increased. This shows how the temperature has skyrocketed over the past decades. I notice how the temperature started to increase from 1980-2000 as industrialization and transportation continued developing, thus leading to more pollution and contamination in cities. \n\nI wonder why the temperature did not increase nor decrease from 1850-1900. What is the main factor of global warmings and how does this lead to an increase in temperature? I wonder what life would be like if fossil fuels and substances that harm the earth did not exist. By 2050, what will the world be like if the temperature keeps increasing by large amounts? \n\nMy community and I as we are affected by global warming and high temperatures. This shows that we must save the earth and take care of it. For example, recycling and using electric cars. It will be a challenge to change our ways as we are used to using plastic water bottles and gasoline powered cars. I feel as though electric cars are expensive, but in the future if they are cheaper, I will buy one.

Why has it not slow down and how can we slow it done? Whnat happeneds if it gets too hot?\n\nThe impact this has on my and my commuity is that each year it gets hotter and hotter and this can be a problem in many ways. One way being that if it keeps getting hotter and hotter it can cause many problems to us and the plants as the sun will be to hot and the plants won't be able to get healthy for us. Another way is that it can cause the ice to melt in many place which can lead to disease that have been frozen over the years.\n\n\"temperatures rises each year, risk rises each year!!\"",

I find it concerning that it hasn't gone down in any way, indicating there are no signs of slowing down with the effects being potentially irreversible. \n- I wonder what led to this spike in climate rising as well as what contributed to it the most. The reason being that there are a number of factors that can go into the rise of temperature most notably global warming with a large part of it being CO2 gases from fossil fuels and cattle.\n- This relates to me and my community as there has been an increase in warmer days which is nice in the short term and concerning moving forward. The reason being that water levels could rise which could lead to floods, lost of animal habitats, and increased rainfall. On the other hand, the sun has been out more in the winter which is nothing short of amazing. \n- Too Hot to Handle! Rise in Heat Making Waves!",

I would even argue during the 1970's decade the increase is hardly noticeable. I also like how you mentioned the peaks in temperatures. January of 1990. 2000, and 2016 along with December of 2010 and 2020 seem to be the most drastic peaks. I too talked about wonder if the temperature would ever stop increasing. I like how you brought up real life situation that could better this issue. I also liked your statement \"This trend of increasing temperature could eventually be irreversible so we need to be aware of how to slow it down.'

The exceptions to this trend are the 1970s where the average temperature does not change significantly from the previous decade, and the 1980s where the range of temperatures is significantly smaller than the 1940s-1970s.\n\nI wonder why the two outliers exist and what triggered these decades to have unexpected rangers and average temperatures. I wonder why despite evidence many do not believe the dangers global warming presents. I wonder where these temperatures were taken and if that has any impact on the data trend.

The toll wide temperature ranges have on infrastructure is obvious. When roads, bridges, and most other substances get cold they contract. The problem lies when the temperature rapidly increases; the asphalt expands irregularly forming cracks and aiding in the formation of the infamous pothole. This chunk of missing road causes thousands of dollars in damages annually when any unassuming driver hits one.\n\nThe Dangers We Pose to Ourselves",

As of 2023, the average temperature has gone up over 1.6 degrees Celcius. After the 1970s, the temperature graphs seem to rise by at least 0.2 Celcius per decade. The only year that even comes close to matching the temperature of 2023 is 2016.\n2) I wonder if the rising temperatures result from a natural process or if man and man-made inventions have affected them. One specific thing I wonder is if the common use of cars has caused rising temperatures. Cars started becoming common means of travel around the 1950s, and the first big jump in temperature we see is in the 1970s. I wonder if the evolution of cars and the automobile industry could have impacted the temperatures this significantly. Overall, I'm just curious about how any of our factories, nuclear plants, etc. could have contributed to the rising temperatures.\n3) This relates to me and my community because it means a change in our environment. This winter, we've seen much less snow than average, considering our first big snowfall wasn't until January. When I was younger, we would start getting our first snowfall in October. Since the temperature is changing around us, we have to adapt to the hotter weather during all seasons.

However, what\u2019s causing it? In the 1940s-1970s the temperatures remained fairly constant. But, this was the era of large industrialization, planes and automobiles. For the first time, the average citizen had a car. So, why has the increase in temperature been so significant in modern times? Times that people are so very conscious of carbon emissions? If the argument is that climate change is caused by cars (hence the need for electric cars), then why would an era with such a focus on automobiles have such a low temperature? Were the emissions not happening? Do the emissions accumulate? If they accumulate, then why was the temperature seemingly not impacted by the emissions of the Industrial Revolution? Older cars typically use a carburetor or don\u2019t have a catalytic converter- thus having the potential to use even more gas, and more emissions. So what\u2019s going on here?

At the start of 2023, the average temperature was at an all time high, with the high and low January temperatures being close to 1.8 and 1.05 degrees above the average temperature in 1960, respectively.  Between 1940 and 1960 the temperatures followed very similar trends - almost indistinguishable from each other - which makes me wonder what happened in the 1970s to cause such a spike in temperatures. In the 1970s, oil production was at an all time high and America began the steep climb of industrialization, helped by the development of steam powered vehicles. However, this was only in America. What happened in the rest of the world to spike such change in Global temperatures? An increase in global temperature is detrimental to life all over the world. Since many plants and animals are not accustomed to these changed temperatures, they will be forced to adapt or die off.

    "comment info": "What do you notice?\nThere is a clear upward trend in temperature throughout the decades. However, I also noticed that the title is a bit misleading. It uses the word \"shattered\", which immediately makes me think there was a huge surge in temperature. After looking at the graph, the average was only a measly 0.1 degrees Celsius more.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why there is an increase in temperature over time. Did humans cause it? Is it a natural cycle of the Earth? My guess, because there is a very minimal change in temperature through decades, is that this is a natural cycle of the Earth.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nRealistically, this doesn't bother or relate to me much. Yes, there is a slow increase of about a Celsius in temperature. However, it is not large enough of an increase for me to feel it physically or worry about it at all. To summarize, this doesn't relate to me or my community enough to say anything definitive.\n\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea.\nRecord Breaking Temperatures: Something to worry about?",

How did you calculate the 0.1 degree C. increase?  \n\nRemember that the goal of the Paris Agreement is to have less than a 1.5 degree C. increase.  What percentage increase is our increase of the goal?  If not a spike, how would you describe it?  \n\nAlso, given what is happening with climate, why not reducing the rate of increase, or having no increase, or having a decline in global temperature?",
