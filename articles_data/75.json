And as each group get's older in age, they are less in favor of college athletes being paid. This is likely due to younger generations siding with student athletes their age, while older age groups are sticking to more traditional ideas. \n\n2. What do you wonder? I wonder why so many more men think college athletes should be paid than women. If I had to guess, this might be because men are more likely to be invested in money dominant sports like football and basketball.

I think someones athletic background is essential to this topic, as someone with no interest in sports may not be sure. \n\n3. What impact does this have you and your community? Even though I don't think I will play competitive sports in college, being a high school athlete has shown me how much dedication and hard work it takes to be an athlete.

When these sports get more serious in high school years, people may be less inclined to continue them into college if they don't receive payment for them. In some cases, I understand that athletes may receive a full ride or lesser tuition than others. But, this is not the case for every player.\n\n4. What's going on in this graph?

If your notice makes a claim, where in the graph is the evidence to support it?\nI notice that the people who are going through the college process would agree that college athletes should be paid. People of the older generation lean more against this idea - and I conclude that it is because of the change in tuition for college.

I notice that the age range of the highest percentage of people that agreed yes, (18-29) is the age that would be both getting college offers and playing college sports, so they are the most biased to agree. \n2. I wonder why the older the range, the higher percentage of disagreeing with paying college athletes. \n3. This relates to my community because people at our school get college sport offers, and they may be persuaded to go to one school based on how much money they are being paid. This is similar to how much money a school offers a student to attend, meaning the scholarship they get.\n4. College conferences changing cost?",

White people, women, and senior citizens are all least likely to believe college athletes deserve a salary. It appears that most people however seem to believe college athletes should be paid.\n2.\tI wonder if the societal impact upon these groups of people affects their opinions on the matter. With age comes experience, so maybe older people do not believe college athletes should be paid because experience has taught them that they do not deserve it. Perhaps the racial minorities voting higher could be due to the fact that it\u2019s hard enough for them to make money as it is being a racial minority in America, where it\u2019s statistically harder to get jobs and higher salaries.\n3.\tMany people around me are going to play college football.

Most likely because the issue is most pertinent to them and student-athletes of that age group and would be most advantageous to them, the category 18-29 has the largest percentage of respondents who believe universities should pay their players. The least number of those voting \"no\" are in the 60+ age group. They also have the greatest number of \"unsure\" voters. This is probably because collegiate athletics are not popular among persons in that age group.

In my community, I know many student athletes who are committed to playing sports in college. From their experiences, I know it is a lot to be a college student athlete, managing their studies while also committing to their sport. These athletes play for their school, who benefits from them especially if they win.

Yet it is hard to tell how many people are unsure in total because the figures don't add up to 100. In age: 18-44 more than 50% say yes to athletes who should get paid by their college.  45-60 both have 60% that say no to athletes getting paid. With this I can tell more younger people agree with rather than the older people who disagree. In race: Both Black and Latino have 70% of people who agree. On the other hand White people have 60% who disagree. In gender: More than 50% male agree while more than 50% of women disagree. More men are saying yes to athletes getting paid, this could lead into having more male athletes. \n2. I wonder if this information is based on the people in college or if they did go to college. Not only this but if it was asked to athletes as well. Also if this was asked to not only athletes, but a family member of an athlete. This can create a biased opinion. \n3. This relates to the community by benefitting low income communities. When athletes come from a low income community they would be able to benefit from being paid by their college. Their family will also benefit from this. By providing money for them they will be guaranteed good resources, supplies, and health. \nHeadline: Should Colleges Pay Up to Their Athletes?",

Similarly, I wonder why people who are white are much less in agreement with people who are black and latino in terms of colleges paying their athletes.

I'm curious as to why so many elderly folks think colleges shouldn't pay their players.

This makes sense as these are the two groups that are most invested in watching college sports. Due to the fact of these groups have a closer connection with college sports, it's only fair that they also have a higher percentage of yes. What is really surprising to me is the disparity between yes and no in the race/ethnicity category. I have no idea why there is such a large percentage difference between Black/Latino and White people. If I had to take a wild guess it would be because of the wealth disparity between the three races but honestly, I am not really sure.",

I also notice that the largest population of people unsure were in the age group of over 60. When it comes to race, black and latinos both have 69% of their population thinking college athletes deserve to be paid, while white people only have 34%. Next I noticed that majority of women answered no. \n2.I wonder if the reason older people were more likely to say no to collegiate athletes being paid was because if they were athletes in college they didn't get paid, and therefore they see no reason for people in college now to get this. I also wonder why in the age groups of 45-59 and 60 up the same percent said no but much more were undecided in the 60 and older group. Lastly I question if the reason much less white people(compared to the poc) said yes to athletes and pay was because of the economic gap between white people and black and latinos in America. \n3.This relates to me and my community because as a senior in highschool me and my classmates are preparing for our lives in college. This for some people may include being an athlete either for enjoyment, scholarships or for both, therefore this argument of collegiate athlete pay directly affects my age group. This also affects low-income students who would benefit drastically from pay while competing on a college team. \n4.Making Bands while making baskets.",

I noticed that in the age category, those who are 60 or older disagreed that colleges should pay their athletes, while the younger they are the more likely they are to agree similar to the other groups like minorities and men.  I also noticed that women disagreed more than men. This has me believing that the inequality within colleges, especially in sports, is playing a huge input in why women would feel the need to disagree due to the fact that men already have been given more opportunities than what they've been trying to earn. Moreover, as generations go by, the younger they are the stronger they believe in their worth and time. Hence why several of them agreed to colleges paying their athletes. \n2.I wonder if the data was collected from past and present college athletes. To put it into other words, when asked, for example, were the 60-year-olds past college athletes, or were they random 60-year-olds just randomly asked? Same thing for the \"Gender\" data. Were the men and/or women being asked also college athletes, college students, or random people?\n3. This relates to my community as there are several students who are planning to continue their athletic careers in college. Sadly I am not an athlete, but I am not blind to the fact of how little women are hyped for college sports. This graph further proves it. \n4. HEADLINE: \nAthletes Win and Lose...Yet at What Cost?",

Specifics are unclear, for what the source of payment is, making the question simpler to dictate a yes-or-no answer upon; it reflects the perspective of how each age group sees this idea. College students are associating money as a benefit, based on the glorification of being paid. The more experience with age, creates the factor of how it may be either unnecessary or lead to other unhealthy habits with money. The older the age group, the less they are for payments. \n\n2. I wonder if there were specifics or if the question was worded differently, how different groups would respond. For example if they were to make money based on promoting their team on social media, or there was income coming from work that the athletes do in order to benefit the team's fan base and respect. Would this alter all of the responses, or create the same distribution?\n\n3. This relates to sports in my town, as a cluster association for each individual team.

Many of those older than 44 voted no making up more than half of the no percentage on this graph. The older the age group, the more people who vote no. Younger people are more affected by this question because they are the ones who are currently in or just graduated college. This may bias their opinion because they are already spending a lot of money to go to college for their studies and are taking in a whole new commitment. Unlike older generations, younger generations have been more focused on college athletics. More men then women also voted yes on this graph. I think this is due to more men playing college sports than women. College women's sports have not always existed and many colleges still don't have select women sports. They may feel men are already having an opportunity they may not have so why should they get paid for it too. \nI wonder how these people in the survey were chosen. Did they all go to college?

The graph illustrates the responses in three different categories; one bar graph represents the responses between men and women, one represents the responses between black, white, and latino men and women, and the last represents the responses between different ages. \n \nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis graph relates to me because I am a senior in high school and this issue is something I personally have an opinion on. It is a topic that I will face in only a couple months and it is helpful to know what the differing opinions are. \n \nHeadline: College Athletes: Deserving of Pay?",

I also noted that males in this study were more likely to answer yes, while females said no more frequently.\n\n2) I wonder how many (if any) athletes were included in the case study, and how that would affect the results. I wonder if there is a reason as to why the Black and Latino ethnic group want college athletes to be payed more than the white ethnic group? I'm also curious how this study relates to the whole population of US adults, and whether it's an accurate picture of the population.\n\n3) Some people devote time and money to their sports careers prior to and through college, but the majority of college players still spend a lot of money to play. As my peers began to commit to or participate in college athletics, the subject became more pertinent. It shouldn't be that universities profit off of athlete's likenesses without compensation to their players.

This makes sense because younger people, ages 18-29 are more likely to empathize with college athletes because they are closer to them in age. People who are Black and Latino also show to agree that colleges should pay their athletes. Blacks and Latinos are often minorities that struggle to pay for college, so having colleges pay their athletes, especially those that are diverse could help someone who can't afford college. I also notice that Men favor the idea more than women. I wonder why men answer yes more than women do. I also wonder what possible confounding factors there are when gathering information for this graph. Is it possible that the population was made up of all men and women leaving a college basketball game? These factors can affect the outcome of the graph. This relates to me because as someone entering college and as an avid sports fan, I have been paying attention to the recent allowance for college athletes to be paid.

They work really hard to balance work, school and sports to be able to gain attention from colleges. Colleges will then notice them and use their hard work to gain more attention for themselves. Colleges should atleast pay them for all the stress that they will go under. \n\n4. Student Athletes: Do They Deserve to be Paid?",

For instance, 70% of those ages 18-29 agreed that colleges should pay their athletes. However, only 29% of people 60 or older agreed that said that they should pay their college athletes. This is likely because people between 18-29 contains all those who this issue is most likely relevant to.

In our findings, we found that typically the younger the person the more they agree with the idea of paying college athletes. The rates of the vote \u201cyes\u201d drop from 70% (ages 18-29) to 29% (age 60 or older). Another finding we found interesting was the racial and ethnicity graph. There is a considerable difference between people of color and white people if they voted yes or not. One other factor to consider is the gender factor. Unsurprisingly, men voted yes more than women did. There are already many more opportunities for men in the sports field than there arefor women. Everyone knows the wage gap between male and female athletes. All in all, the graph shows us whether certain age groups, genders, and ethnicities agree with the idea of paying college athletes.",

Additionally, I notice how people who are black or latino or more likely to say \"yes\" than people who are white. Men are also more likely to say \"yes\" than women. The age difference could be because some of the younger people who responded to this poll may be college athletes themselves or be friends with college athletes. I wonder if the people surveyed would change their answer if they were/ were not college athletes. I wonder what their reasoning is for their answer. This graph relates to my community because I have a good friend who will be playing a D1 sport in college, which leads me to wonder further if collegiate athletes should be paid by their schools.

Another thing is that Black and Latinos have a higher chance of supporting athletes getting paid. Lastly, we noticed that men seem to agree on the topic more than women. A wonder we had was why are older people and women more likely to be against the decision of payment. Another wonder we had was why there is a large gap between white and Black/Latino individuals.

I wonder why a smaller number of women in the study believe that student athletes shouldn\u2019t be payed. Knowing multiple black athletes committing to play D1 at universities, the fact that their likeness can be exploited by the schools but not for their own financial gain revokes their ability to build their own financial success.

What do you notice?\nWhen looking at the race you can see that Black or Latino people are more likely to say yes than white people, it is probably because black people and Latinos make up more of the sports population than white people. Sports is also used as a tool to get out of rough neighborhoods so if college students can make\nmoney in that sport it will help their families.\n2. What do you wonder?\nAre the people over 65 saying no because they didn't get paid when they were in college, out of spite or how things used to be, or is it because they think that college athletes shouldn't be paid?\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nIt will impact my community because if athletes are getting paid I feel as though they will be more likely to finish college rather than run to the big leagues to try and get money. It also might provide better performance because you know that you are getting paid the better you do not only for an award, for the team\nand school.\n4. What's going on in this graph?

However, I also notice that those of older age aren't in college and therefore they most likely have different beliefs about whether college athletes should be paid.\n\n2) What do you wonder?\n-I wonder why a lot of older people believe that colleges shouldn't pay their athletes. I also wonder why older people tend to disagree more with college athletes getting paid. Do you think this is due to the fact that when they were in college it was a lot cheaper than it is now?\n\n3) How does this relate to you and your community?\n-This is relevant to me and my community because many high school athletes, like myself, may have looked for ways to join a college team in order to secure scholarships.

This may have its origins in the widely held belief that younger athletes will perform better during the sporting seasons and that these students will bring significant victories to the institutions they represent. However, the elder generation believes that young athletes shouldn't be compensated for their physical abilities. Ethnic groupings also differ significantly from one another.\n2) I'm curious as to why so many people think that some racial groups should have more access to employment opportunities than others. Where does the ambiguity surrounding athlete compensation come from? Does the responses to the survey have anything to do with respondents' ages? Can the government's budget be strained by compensating athletes?\n3) This is relevant to me and my community because many of the high school athletes, like myself, may have looked for ways to join a college team in order to secure scholarships. Many people have this as their major objective because they may not have enough money to pay for tuition and their entire school. Minorities and students from disadvantaged backgrounds would experience less financial stress if student athletes were paid.\n4) \u201cShould Athletic Commitment Come With Pay?\u201d\n    \"Student-Athlete talent, a Debt Unpaid, Can The Young Demographic Change That?\"",

This could be because of younger college athletes would most likely answer yes and the older group would answer no because of either they were athletes and weren't paid or they are head of the university and don't want to pay them.\n\nWhat do I wonder: I wonder if people don't want to pay because of the fact that mainly male sports would bring in the most revenue and the amount of publicity the college has. For the most part I wonder if they also don't want to pay because of the fact they would have to pay female athletes as well.\n\nHow do this relate to me and my community: This relates to me because as a highschooler, student athletes are worrying about getting an athletic scholarship to get to college.

I wonder if the economic situation at home of the people asked to vote affected their response. For example, if someone comes from a family that struggles financially, might they think that athletes should get paid since they won't be able to work due to the games and practices. Also, might the older groups not think athletes should get paid because they might not see all the things athletes have to do to promote the schools on social media platforms.\n3. This relates to my community because in my community there have been athletes that have made it to play college level and since they aren't able to work, I believe it interferes with their financial situations. My community is made up of families that aren't wealthy so if the student is playing sports, they are no longer able to have a job and help out with financial factors which is why I believe the latino group agreed very strongly for athletes to get paid.\n4.

But for me, I never watch women's sports because it doesn't entertain me like men's sports would. Which is why I think fewer viewers equals less money.  But in the end, athletes should get paid, even if it's a small amount because every little bit can and will help them greatly with their school, future, and daily life. My catchy headline is, \u201cPay to play or get paid to play.\u201d",

While the main group who said colleges shouldn't, was people the age 60 and older. I sort of understand why the younger ages want the pay while the older don't. But I'm pretty sure that the younger people who are going to college or just finishing think it's right to get paid since it will help out with student loans and many other things involving school. Along with financially helping in their daily life. Since this will cause less stress when it comes to school, sports, and student loans. On the other hand, the older people said no because I think they want the younger generations to go through what they had to go through. Playing the sport and going to school without getting paid for doing some extra activity. Feel as if athletes shouldn't be awarded something since they never were. So I completely agree why younger people do want athletes to get paid while older people don't. (This could be completely wrong, but it just seemed as if this could be one reason)",

People play these sports as careers, so why don't the cheaters get punished from their actions separately from the other players who aren't cheating? \n     Statistics show according to the graph, black men won't likely be the ones to say collages should pay their athletes, because blacks are the highest paid athletes. To me this isn't fair for many reasons: you can decide what color you come out the womb as, nor have the abilities to change that, so why should blacks be paid more than other races? I think the entire situation with college athletes' pay is completely unfair.

Another thing is that I think the reason that 60 and older have a majority of no is because whenever they were in college tuition rates were different, so they may not see that amount of struggle that some young adults go through from debt. \nI would also like to mention that my idea of getting paid by not just the college was right.

That's the difference between theoretical and experimental; we base our theories off of our hypothetical experience(opinions), and experiments off of carrying out the hypothesis to the masses. \nFor example, I could have theorized Men have a higher \"yes\" disposition than the Women (who have a higher \"Unsure\" disposition than men) due to the fact that I'm aware that society associates athleticism with masculinity. Now, just because I'm aware of this doesn't provide data evidence; I would need some sort of chart to prove my point, with percentages and visuals.

If we were to piggyback off of the trend with the younger generation and say they were influenced because of their athleticism, it could still be a suggestion as black people of african descent (particularly west african) genetically have more fast-twitch fibers compared to white people. Little research specifies on latinos, making the argument a little wobbly. \nOn the flipside, people 60 or older have the highest \"no\" rate.

    "comment info": "Evidence shows age, race/ethnicity, and gender impacting opinions\nFrom ages 19-29, the youngest age bracket, 70% of people think that colleges should have paid athletes; most likely because they do not have a career or steady paycheck flowing in yet. So, they would not mind having some extra money earned from their talents to fall back on. In fact, my uncle, who was a college athlete 2 years ago, has talked to me about this topic saying that now, as he is trying to get a job, the extra cash would have been a good jump start to a career. But, as age goes up, so does the number of people who disagree with athletes getting paid; by 60+ only 29% of people voted yes. \n\nIn terms of race/ethnicity, 69% of Black athletes voted yes, 69% of Latinx athletes voted yes, and only 34% of White athletes voted yes. This may be because of financial stature, needing to provide for families, or even just due to the number of athletes at these colleges. Finally, there are more men than women who voted yes. This may be due to the number of male vs female athletes or because of inequality. However, there is not enough evidence in this graph to reflect any of the reasons given above; these are just possibilities. \n\nIn my case, I do think that colleges should pay their athletes because of possible situations at home, extra money to help their future, and because they are helping the college earn money. Without the athletes, there would be no games, no revenue, and no earnings for the college.",

However, now I know that collegiate athletes could be paid up to millions and millions of dollars. \n\nAlso, I believe that young Black men are more likely than any other group to say that college should pay their athlete because, going off of prior stories I have heard, not many black athletes have come from wealthy homes. Therefore, this could be a way for them to provide for their families who have worked hard to get their sons into college. In addition, if someone is really good at a sport and has left their family, who could need their help, to play this post for a college, it is the right thing to do; colleges should endorse this athlete.",

I noticed that as the people get older, their responses tend to lean towards \"no\" and the younger people seem to vote \"yes\" as well as a majority of men picked \"yes\" while it was opposite for the women. I wonder why most of the women picked \"no\" since female athletes in general do not get paid equal or even near close to the men. Personally, I would pick \"yes\" since I am an athlete myself and plan to play football in college. I can see why most of the younger people picked \"yes\" because they're either an athlete in college, an upcoming athlete, or the group that watches college sports the most.

On how women deserve the same amount as men because we are all equal. But if the women were to see the amount of viewers they get compared to men, they should start to realize why they get paid less. I also think the reason older ages said no to college athletes being paid is because they were once athletes who never got paid. So they want 2022 college athletes to deserve the same.

Why is there more Latino and Black votes and barely any White? \nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nI personally don't think this has much to do with my community and me, but I think it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes. Reason being these students are showing off their school making it draw peoples attention and creating popularity for the school. If these students didn't play the school probably wouldn't be as popular. \nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph? Create a catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea.\nThe graph is showing the rate of people voting for, \"Do you think colleges should pay their athletes?\"  The votes come from different genres like Age, Race/ Ethnicity, and Gender.

This is because it affects them directly and would provide money for their current schooling, housing, and other commodities that they would need money for. I believe that student-athletes should be paid at least a little because of their dedication to the sport and the fact that they aren't allowed to have a job while in season. As someone who is soon to be considered in the college-aged category, I understand that everything is expensive and money is needed, but at the same time I wonder what would be considered a \"good rate\" and if your pay counts on how good the team is, if the school is large, or your playtime in-game.",
