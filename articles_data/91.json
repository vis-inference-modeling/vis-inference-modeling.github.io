A severe heat wave hit the northwest in June 2021. These estimates, I assume, were influenced by the wildfires that raged across the West. A strong cold spell has struck the Midwest. In recent years, I believe climate change has had a considerable impact on US temperatures. In 2002, the United States experienced a severe heatwave, followed by another in 2020. Given that the data in 2019 were nowhere near what they are now, I'm curious as to why there was such a sudden rise in temperatures.

In June of 2021, the northwest faced an intense heatwave. I believe the wildfires that raged across the West had an impact on these figures. The Midwest has been hit by a severe cold spell. I believe that climate change has had a significant impact on US temperatures in recent years. The United States endured a significant heatwave in 2002, and then another one in 2020. I'm curious as to why there was such a rapid jump in temperatures, given the statistics in 2019 were nowhere near what they are now. I'm curious as to how the environment and temperature will change in the next years. If the temperatures continue to rise, there will be a slew of issues, and I'm not sure what they will be. I also noted that Hawaii experienced a cold spell in 2021, which is surprising given that Hawaii is a tropical state. I believe that the United States must take action to address climate change.

California. \n\nSee tables and maps by Sheridan et al at Kent State U. \nThe animated maps of system types around the globe are especially cool:http://sheridan.geog.kent.edu/ssc3.html, 2021 and historical trend maps\n\nTypo: you did not say what metric was for the record T. Daily max, daily min, monthly max or what? Also, it would be good to show historical avg or median at same time.",

The same goes for 2021, just last year, there was a record huge breaking heat temperature spike. The other years go up and down and fluctuate with far more heat temperature records being broken. This could be accredited to climate change as over the years the earth becomes hotter, so fewer cold temperature records are being broken. We can see on the second graphic that these record temperatures are being broken in 2021. For the most part the majority of these heat record are recorded in the upper northwest. Around a dozen are spread out across the southwest. The cold record temperatures are recorded in the middle of the United States. Some of the largest are recorded in Texas, which I would not normally think would be a place for cold temperature records. The graph also shows when the hot and cold records occurred.

I also noticed in 1994 there was an extreme period of cold, while in 2021 there was an extreme period of heat. In the second graph, I noticed that Oregon and Washington had the most record heat temperatures by far. The most cold records were in the south and midwest. I wonder what factors contributed to the records being broken in very condensed areas, and why the east coast has no temperature records at all. The multitude of record heat temperatures does raise a lot of concerns about what we can do about climate change in the US. I also wonder how these extreme temperatures are affecting the environment.",

    "comment info": "In this graph, I notice that the June heatwave struck Oregon extremely hard compared to anywhere else in the United States. Also, Cheyenne and between Colorado and North Mexico also had record-breaking heatwaves. The percentage of weather stations that reported the heat waves in 2020 broke the record by an estimate of 2% compared to the other highest records in 2002 and 2012. The cold snaps hit the mid-west mostly in states like Arkansas, Nebraska, and some in Texas. This record of weather stations seems to be equal to the stations in 1993. I wonder why the cold snaps or heat waves did not heat the eastside of the country at all. I also wonder why Hawaii had broken the record of cold snaps since it is known to be a very warm climate. This graph relates to me and my community because it tells me where in my country the temperature broke past records, although my area did not. A title for this graph would be, \"Record-Breaking Weather in a Record-Breaking Year.\"",

This is different from around d 1995, where some of the lowest temperatures ever were recorded. However, there is very little data on the east coast, which provokes questions about the accuracy of the data, and why there was such a small amount of data. I also noticed that in Oregon, many record for the highest temperatures were set. I wonder why this was, and if Oregon continues to grow warmer as the years go on. I also wonder why data was only collected in June and February, considering high and low temperatures can occur during any winter or summer month. I wonder if this pattern of high temperatures will increase, and how it will affect the environment. Also, since I live on the east coast, I would like to know the heat and cold conditions in my state, however there is no data provided. I think a good name for this graph would be, \"Developing Temperature Conditions Across the US\".",

In the northwest, they experienced an extreme heatwave in June of 2021. I believe that the wildfires that occurred in the west had an effect on these numbers. In the midwest, they experienced a major cold snap. I believe that climate change has had a huge effect on the temperatures of the US over the past few years. In 2002, the US experienced a major heatwave, and then in 2020, they experienced an even bigger. I wonder why there was such a huge rise in temperatures so quickly because in 2019 the numbers were nowhere near what they became. I wonder what the climate and temperature are going to look like in the next few years. If the temperatures continue to increase then there are going to be many problems, and I wonder what they exactly are going to be. I also noticed that there was a cold snap in Hawaii in 2021 which is shocking because Hawaii is a tropical state. I believe that the US needs to make a move in the task of fixing climate change. This affects my community because even though my state was not affected directly in this graph, I am a part of the entire US that is affected by climate change.

    "comment info": "The first thing that I noticed in the graph was the June heat wave happening in the Pacific Northwest, or Oregon, Washington, and parts of Idaho and California. There are also spots in Utah, Nevada, and Colorado. I think this probably occurred because of the wildfires that were happening out west last June due to drought and lack of moisture. Conversely, states in the midwest seemed to get colder, such as in Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. I recall the massive blizzard and cold snap that occurred in winter of 2021, leaving many Texans and residents of Arkansas without power or heat. I also noticed that in both scenarios, the largest \"circles\" are in areas that are the farthest away from the ocean. \n\nI wonder why certain parts of the country are experiencing more hot extreme temperatures, while others are experiencing colder extremes. More importantly, how is this possible when some of them practically overlap each other? One thing that I also wonder is how the US government is planning on responding to the growing weather extremes happening in the US. Is the a change in moisture patterns, shown by the graph? Will there be a carbon tax imposed? Sustainable energy? \n\nThis impacts me and my community because I am a teenager who is watching climate change affect my environment in my own eyes. Eventually, when I grow up, it will be me and my generation's responsibility to help reduce or reverse climate change before it's too late. \n\nHeadline: \"Thermometers set a personal record\"",

And on the other end, the pacific northwest registered higher heat temperatures. I would have estimated the opposite of the final data. I wonder how long this consistency in sporadic changes in climate is sustainable not only for our country shown in this graph but also how this affects our planet at large. We have many practical steps that each individual can do, to help reduce our carbon footprint. But in reality what are the major causes for these spikes? I wonder what legislature needs to be put in place, for the major contributors to this issue in our communities to begin to make a change. I am from Portland Oregon so in my community, these spikes are not welcomed with open arms by most. People in my community are not often exposed to such heat so it caused momentary health issues and scares when high heat have occurred.

In places like Washington and Oregon, which are known hot places there are spikes in temperature in clusters nevertheless, other places like Texas up to Nebraska there were record breaking cold temperatures.\n2.I wonder how south dakota got both coldest and hottest records being within the same state and the locations for these records as they are very close to each other.\n3.This relates to me and my community as it indicates temperatures change overtime as temperatures overall before were colder which shows there is evident climate change or at least another variable is in it. \n4.Temperature Spikes in the US",

    "comment info": "What do you notice?\nI noticed that there aren't any record breaking temperatures on the east end and they are mainly on the west and central parts of America. The record-breaking hot temperatures are all on the west end and central America is where the record-breaking cold temperatures are. In the histogram, the highest percentage occurs around 1994 and 2021. Compared to the rest of the graph this is wildly different with most of it not too far over 5%.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nWhat is stopping the east end from having record-breaking temperatures? What is the geographical reason for this occurrence? What temperatures are considered record-breaking?\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nLiving in New Jersey, we don't have too high of highs or too low of lows. Unlike a state on the west end, New Jersey has four distinct seasons so maybe this is the reason for the east end not having any record-breaking temperatures.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?

When looking at the map, we do not see any of the dots on the east coast besides a lonely one in Georgia. Then, in the bar chart at the top, we see that in 1994 and in 2021 there has been an overwhelming amount of record breaking temperatures on both sides of the spectrum. \n2) What do you wonder? \nI wonder what happened in 1994 and 2021 that was so different than the others that broke all these temperature records within those years. I also I wonder how it's possible for a state to set a record for hot weather and for cold weather. \n3) How does this relate to you and your community? \nThis relates to me and my community in New Jersey we get cold and hot conditions but according to the graph we do not get the half of it so I wonder what its like to be within these conditions. \n4) In the graph, we see the percentage of weather stations that broke temperature records in it's corresponding year.

What do you notice?\nI noticed that there are almost no temperature records set on the entirety of the east coast and that all of the records set on the west coast were heat record.
