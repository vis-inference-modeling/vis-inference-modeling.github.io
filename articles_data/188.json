    "comment info": "This graph is a very unique application of simple data collecting. In addition to providing us all with information concerning the travel efficiency, the commuter has also created a hobby which can occupy her time taking said train. Fortunately, many times the train is not excessively late as there are many gray areas in the scarf. In addition, these usually come in larger blocks of color symbolizing a longer span of days where the train was not too late. The pink areas are interspersed less often than the grey, but they occur regularly enough that one can assume that this train runs behind schedule for about a third of the time it runs. The red spaces, representing the longest wait time for trains or delays in both directions occurs much less often except in one outlier. On the right side of this graph, there is one solid chunk of red. This could represent a time when the transit system was dealing with renovations, working on a light schedule, or dealing with inclement weather, such as a season's worth of snow. Either way, there was a major obstacle in the Munich transit system which caused the train to be excessively late during that period. A good headline would be, \"Weaving in and out of traffic\".",

It could just be the weaver's preference of fabric, but I believe that it could relate to the different sides of the political spectrum. Rarely are the red and blue pictured next to each other, almost always separated by a stripe of white, a barrier of sorts. This could represent how most times, democrats and republicans are unable to work together to form policy in America. However, I do not know what the purpose of the width of the stripes means in this case. It probably represents some form of data, but I am unsure of whether it relates to laws being passed, or percentages of people getting laws passed.",

    "comment info": "1.) As the timings of the delays are relatively interspersed and the only major delay seems to be in one spot, perhaps the delays are rarer than the graph implies at first glance. And the most significant delay, occurring only once, may have been because of some extraneous circumstance. A holistic critique of the train system should look to account for these factors if they are present. \n\n2.) The pink areas are far more concerning than the red ones, as these \"minor, yet still significant\" delays are very common. Although there may be an expectation set that some delay will occur, it's very clear the train operators could be making some changes to improve the efficiency of the train.",

I think this is because a large part of the German rail system was built under the command of Hitler, which means that it is old and dangerous. In an attempt to make these lanes safer, the German government may be trying to repair or modernize the system, which could be the cause of most delays.\n\n2. I also believe that because of all the delays, people have had to change their way of life. Consecutive train delays could have changed people's expectations about the train schedule. This means that people already expect the train to arrive late instead that on time. This could have made them wake up earlier to take the train before the time they do so they can be on time for their jobs or activities.",

Something that is very questionable to me is that after a large portion near the end of the scarf was red meaning that for a good ,much longer period of time than the other delays, there were even more common red delays after it had passed. To me it seems this could be a part of a train delay since it is common to travel through public transportation. I speculate if there was maybe a construction project going on that could have started this very long delay but I also speculate that this could have been caused by a terrible accident that the train had to do some kind of reconstruction that is still expressing delays but much more frequently than before. \n2. Another thing that concerns me is we are not provided with a scale or legend that could possibly help us in identifying certain details. A scale providing a measurement of how long a row is a certain day would be helpful because we don't know the period of time and it is confusing to gather information when some rows of colors are much thicker than others. I believe the thickness of the lines makes sense since though that means it happened more than once that they experienced that delay the next day.",

The scarf may be making the statement that, if the woman really had enough time to create the scarf on merely delay time, she could be doing something more productive and important rather than wasting the time waiting.

Considering the fact that this scarf is comparable to a Calendar, it can be inferred that this red block happened during Summertime where tourism reaches its peak throughout the world. However, this causes problems for the working citizens of Germany as the train system cannot compensate for that heavy usage, making work far more difficult than it has to be.\n\n2. This scarf exposes the transportation system for its insufferable delays in Germany. It ultimately demands change and further investment in transportation to fix or mitigate the congestion. This is especially bad for business as no thriving company is infamous.",

I wonder as to why the delays were so significant during this period in time and why they were very consistent for what could be assumed as around 5 to 6 days. This extreme patch was then still followed by a series of still very stable but long waiting times. Could this have come from people taking a holiday in Germany and them wanting to explore both the urban and countryside areas of the beautiful landscape?\n2. What does this commuter want to reveal with this publication her wait times throughout the course of the year? Could she possibly want to bring the inconvenient wait times of public transport to the officials who are able to control whether or not this is a fixable task? Could she possibly have wanted the people who are possibly thinking about using public transit a little preview of what might come if they also decide to take the public transportation throughout Germany? It could be either or both of these reasons because this woman had to have had some sort of end goal to strive for once she finished her year. She might have thought about how the systems were flawed and needed some rearranging and also could help a few folks from suffering the same wait along the way.",

This woman creatively demonstrates that the countryside of Germany is suffering from efficient public transportation through the color coordination on the scarf. This issue is imperative because countryside folks in Germany need to get to their workplace, house, or destination which requires urgency. Overall, these people on public transportation need a better ride because there is no other way for them to travel and therefore solving this issue can truly only benefit Germany as a whole. \n2) I wonder why this woman would dedicate her time to creating a scarf that only has colors to distinguish the delays of the public transportation she rides on. If she truly intended to show the delays then she should have labeled the scarf with its proper meaning and not just assume that everyone knows what exactly the colors pink, gray, and red represent. Aside from that, she might have simply wanted to get rid of her boredom as she was waiting or even to play a game with the transportation to see if she can predict whether it will be delayed or not.",

I have done some research and I have concluded that urban regions in Germany tend to have better transportation because there are more people that need to get from one destination to the next. Meanwhile, most suburban regions in Germany, such as the countryside, have bad public transportation because money is not primarily invested in innovating trains, buses, etc. Where there is money there is bound to be a better form of public transportation is what I believe.

We notice that on the left side of the knitted cloth, there are many but shorter delays than on the right. On the right side there is a huge chunk of red where the delay was more than 30 minutes and we could probably conclude that it was also in both directions. There were more delays than travel time and short but many stops that caused her to arrive at all different times. It is odd that it was an extreme amount of delay or a short amount of delay but no in between. I wonder what the length was when the knitting took place. Was it everyday?

To answer your question about how long it took a moderator responded to a previous comment asking the same thing and stated that it was made throughout the course of a year, specifically the year 2018. Considering that public transportation is still not as good even though most of Europe is technologically and digitally advanced it goes to show that the countryside of Germany either lacks enough funding or the resources to innovate the different modes of transportation. Now to answer your question about what inspired her to do this I believe that she either wanted a way to pass her time or test her patience even more by creating a scarf or demonstrate the public transportation in the countryside of Germany is at its lowest and needs improvements. The reason I believe is more relevant is to pass time simply because if she intended to expose public transportation she should have shown what the colors represent so that people who look at her scarf question the performance of public transportation and not the color variety of the scarf.

Concurrently, I find it to be innovative and refreshing. Second to that, I notice that the thickness of the lines is greatest in the first two thirds of the scarf and thinnest towards the last one third. Based on this observation, I can infer that the woman experienced more frequent delays in the first two thirds of her year than she did in the remainder.  The wide red row also catches my eye. Both because red is indicative of a delay that was of more than half an hour or delays in both directions and because of its magnitude, I infer that there must have been an enormous accident that caused hours of delays, or perhaps even that the woman herself got into an accident. Since, as stated earlier, red represents up to 30 minute delays or delays in both directions and yet there lies this massive red row but also very slim red rows, I think the graph would be more logical if the woman incorporated a new color that would represent half an hour or greater. I wonder how this might compare to her commute in future years, as transportation technology continues to advance? Also, how would this graph differ if she decided to bike, walk, or take the train instead of driving to work?",

I noticed that there is a red delay towards the right side of the graph that is significant.

I wonder if the longer delays occurred on a certain day, for example maybe there weren't as many delays on weekends since most employee commuters don't have work. So my question would be is there a pattern of the length of the delays based on certain circumstances for example the day of the week or time of the day.

Additionally, there are very many periods of 5 days in a row with grey. These are most likely periods of work days, Monday through Friday, where there are a lot of people commuting to work, increasing the number of time delays. I also noticed that there are periods of multiple days in a row with pink following the gray areas, meaning that there isn't very much traffic on the weekends in this area. I firstly wonder what could have inspired this scarf to be? Why did the creator decide to make this scarf based on their commute to work times? There are a lot of questions that can be asked about why this scarf was created and how inspiration was found to create it. I believe that in this graph a person is commuting to Munich for whatever reason, and that during their trips they are encountering a bit of traffic on the work days because there are also other people that are attempting to get to Munich to work. The period where there was an extended period of 30+ minute delays was most likely a main road closure. There is probably one main road that goes into Munich, and a side road or two. Since the main road was closed down, there was more traffic forced into the side roads, causing greater traffic backup and more time to get through the increase in traffic.",

For example, the color red most of the red marks are small but there is one section that is quite big. I wonder, what do these colors and lengths mean also, is the graph made out of a scarf because, if it is that's really cool! I think that what could be going on in this graph is, something to do with time and days.",

Take another look at the first two paragraphs.  \nWhat do the three colors mean?  \nWhere did the knitter commute?  Is it cold there?  All year?  You\u2019re from California.  It\u2019s not particularly cold there.  Do people knot there?",

    "comment info": "I notice that towards the end of the graph, there is a large portion of red, which indicates a delay of more than half an hour, or delays in both directions. I also notice that after this red portion, the kitting is mostly slimmer lines, which indicates a more constant change in the delays than before. \n\nI wonder why there is a huge portion of the graph that is just red, and why the lines in the graph became slimmer after this red portion; why there was a more constant change in the delays after the larger portion than the steadier change that was shown before. \n\nBy looking at this graph, I can make an assumption about my indications from before. Since there was a steadier change in the delays before the huge red block, I can assume that this red portion triggered the more constant change in the delays that is shown right when the portion ends. \n\n\nA catchy headline for this graph: \n\nA German commuter from Munich uses her kitting needles to show the constantly changing delays in her own (own would be in italics) 40 minute commute.",

What would cause many, many days of delay (can you estimate the number of days, weeks, or months of the biggest red portion).  I wonder what could cause so many days of delay?  Then, combine your thoughts with greatly improved service after the delays.  Does this give you a feasible hypothesis for the large red segment?\nWhen you\u2019ve come up with a hypothesis on the delays followed by fewer days, please share this with us.  Then, how about a short and snappy headline that captures this hypothesis?",

The pink looks white, but since the description gives no value to white, it must be pink.\nYou mention that the scarf \u201cgraph can tell a story of weeks of commuting quicker than written words, or even tables of numbers can.   Why do you think this is so?\nPlease return tomorrow not only to see the article that included this graph but also to see links to websites about other knitted graphs.  In the statistics community, they are a rage.  There are even kits for climate change scarf graphs!\nHave a headline that captures your main ideas?  Please share it with us.",

    "comment info": "We noticed the big red section and wondered if it had anything to do with the season that she was commuting in - was it in the autumn or winter? We then realized that the kind of transportation was important to the conversation - train or bus (no car - too hard to knit)? We think it might have been a bus because we don't know why trains would be delayed. We also noticed that there seemed to be some sort of delay everyday since there was not a color designated as \"no delay\". We also noticed that the scarf is narrower in places - indicating tighter stitching - maybe she was stressed or focused during these times. We thought that the looser knitting might indicate that she was more relaxed. We did some math and estimated that there were about 270 rows - representing 135 days of travel. We know that there are more work days in a year so we think she did this just for a season.",

You raise many questions from your wondering:\nWhich season is the large red segment?\nIs the commute by train, bus, or car?\nIs there a color for no delay?\nWhy is the scarf narrower in some places?\nAre there 270 rows, which would be 135 days of travel?\n\nI suggest to help answer your questions, look at the graph and reread the introduction.  You may be able to uncover some answers.  Also, return tomorrow afternoon when we reveal the article and other information.  Some of your questions will be answered and some we will still wonder about.  \n\nThank you for being so inquisitive.",
