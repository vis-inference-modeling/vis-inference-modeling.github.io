It's a good thing and must be well managed, bringing people in and teaching respect for democracy, rule of law, social reciprocity, and new ideas for the market.\nMy headline- We finally wake up to realize that immigration is what will save us. - But that's a developed world lens. What will be happening to the countries all these new immigrants are coming from. Will they get developed in a responsible way? Will we bring everyone along?",

As we became Industrialized, families needed less kids. And now, as a Technologically-driven economy, kids have become more of a cost and financial burden; just ask the South Koreans (they have the lowest fertility rate in the world).\n\nMost of the 1st World Nations have been undergoing fertility crises for some time, including the U.S, Britain, China, Russia, Japan, Korea, and Germany, and France.\nAnd this crises was intensified by the widespread development of the birth control pill.\nWhat has kept depopulation at bay for a number of developed nations, including the U.S (my home), Germany, England, and France, has been immigration.\nIn the U.S, we\u2019ve used immigrants as a cheap source of labor, but also as a source investment.\n\nBut most importantly, we\u2019ve used them for growth.

This makes the most sense to be as in countries like Niger or Somalia, children are needed to help obtain resources such as money through child labor and/or food; while in other countries, it is easier to obtain these resources and the people in the population do not need their children to help out. \n\n\n-\tThis really does not relate to my community, since I have a large family. \n\n-\t\u201cWhy Are Birth Rates Decreasing World Across the globe\u201d?",

What do you notice?- From looking at this graph, I noticed that as mentioned in the caption, the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) is below the replacement rate, except for certain African regions and the Middle East. The replacement rate is crucial because it indicates the number of children a family can have relative to the current population, ensuring population sustainability.\n\n2. What do you wonder?- I wonder what lies ahead for us, if there is anything. This may sound pessimistic, but I have wondered about this before. Living to an age that feels rather precarious is becoming more common. Living on the edge of existence seems, honestly, much worse than embracing the inevitable end. I feel like to truly feel young, you should act like you are. Letting your age define you is what enforces the idea that age should determine the way you act and that you\u2019re getting old. I think about how we all could feel forever young if we become more aware that tomorrow isn\u2019t promised.\n\n3.

The countries with higher fertility rates are less developed countries, typically in Africa. Low population levels can cause massive issues in the economies of countries and the workforce. This makes me wonder, what are countries doing to help stop this issues? Is this a problem that can be completely prevented? This relates to me because the declining population influences the policies governments put into place. Support systems for the elderly such as social security will not exist for much longer because the increasing burden it is putting on young people.",

As of today, fertility rates are rather low in areas like Hong Kong, China, Italy, and India (places below the replacement fertility line). However, the graph shows that in areas like Nigeria, Mali, and Niger the fertility rates are much larger. In the United States (a fertility rate of 1.7) and many other countries, there is an outstanding number of people. These places are continuously becoming overpopulated, so I find the low fertility rates in this graph quite surprising. \n\nThe surprisingly low fertility rates makes me wonder what is causing them to become so low in the United States and some of the other areas with low rates. Is it one\u2019s age or lifestyle that affects one\u2019s fertility rates? And why are other places like Africa and Mali showing higher rates? I don\u2019t think this decreasing rate of fertility will affect the United States terribly, at least in the beginning. The United States is already so overpopulated and I feel as though it will eventually be very hard to provide everyone with the resources they need.

    "comment info": "- I noticed a disparity in fertility rates between Global South nations, particularly in Africa, where rates remain relatively high, and developed countries, where fertility rates are often below replacement levels, such as in the U.S. However, I was not shocked by China or India having below replacement fertility levels. Additionally, these rates exhibit significant variations across different population sizes.\n- I wonder what specific factors contribute to the higher fertility rates in many African countries compared to the lower rates in developed nations.\n- This data directly affects both my community and me, especially now that our society is dealing with the repercussions of Roe v. Wade in the U.S. Many women are in a state of vulnerability due to limitations on their choice of fertility. This trend could become critical over time. However, it should be acknowledged that with populations in the U.S. already experiencing below replacement fertility, it instills fear of what will happen for future populations. This fear arises when you dwell on the possible socioeconomic consequences with future populations, especially if these populations continue to decline.\n- \"Fertility Frontiers: Insights into Global Fertility Trends and Variances\"",

In America, after World War II, we know that the baby boom occurred\u2013 in which the population grew immensely.  Since then most people have been having fewer and fewer children.  Most parents I know have1-3 kids.  The cultural climate is changing in America\u2026 especially as the cost of living increases.  One thing being specifically affected by this is the cost of housing, healthcare, and childcare\u2026which are all very important in raising a child.  Many women have to quit their jobs in order to stay home with the kids which obviously means less income for the family.",

As a American I wonder mostly whether continued economic growth will create a desire to increase fertility rates, something which really isn't a topic of discussion in political matters. I also wonder whether the high fertility rates in Northern Africa is caused by political destabilization, like the Araba Spring, something that has certainly happened in Venezuela.

I\u2019ve noticed that countries at the bottom of the map, are more developed, and the rate of children per woman goes down. For example in the US, the rate of children is 1.7 per woman, because in the United States, children don't go straight out to the workforce and, unlike undeveloped countries, teens/ adults get paid a substantially greater amount than people in other countries. Although in other countries you may be able to work as a young child, America has placed The Federal Child Labor Law in place so children under the age of 14 can't work, but kids in other countries aren't so fortunate.\n\nAs you go further up the graph, places like Somalia (6.3) and Mali (6.0), the birth to woman ratio is increasingly higher than many developed countries. But a depressing truth is why the birth rates are so high in specific countries, as a woman has more children, they grow up and start working at young ages, making money for corporations that use those kids to make more money. In those countries though, they do not have laws to protect those children or teens from being unpaid in the workforce. This causes many deaths in children in those specific countries. And with the increasing demand to move to a country where the birth rates are lower and everyone who immigrated to the United States, we might experience a population influx, causing the American population to go down.",

But near the bottom is Hong Kong because they only have 0.7 children per woman. The U.S. falls somewhat toward the end. We have 1.7 children per woman. I have one sister and that's it so we fall close to the average. And most of my friends have either one or two siblings max. So this graph makes some sense. The Graph also says that most people now live in places with low-replacement fertility. This means a lot of people live in places where the amount of children per woman is very low. That's why the end of the graph is red because below the red line are the people who have less than 2 kids. I\u2019m not sure why people now live in these areas. It might have something to do with the economy, popular trends, the conditions of where you live, or maybe even the weather. But we don't know that yet.",

Countries in Africa such as Niger, Nigeria and Chad have a much higher fertility rate than let's say China or the United States. From what I have learned, women in African and other regions nearby begin motherhood at a younger age, allowing for them to have more children. Also, it is important to know that many African countries value having larger families, which may have started to counteract the deaths of so many young children due to the lack of necessary resources. \n            On the other side of the graph, even the countries with the most number of people are the lowest in fertility rates and I have reason to believe that it is because of overpopulation. If you look on a map, it is simple to see how China and India are not very large countries, and yet, they still have the highest population. So imagine if that population kept rising, then there would be no room left for anyone. The citizens may not have enough resources for themselves to live off of, yet again for another child. \n    I wonder how overpopulation became such an issue and what different governments are doing about it. I also wonder what governments are doing about the decreased fertility.",

These rates vary a lot across the total population size. The way that fertility is being defined here is quite multifaceted. I wonder how much of this trend has to do with the choice of AFAB people to have children vs. access to healthcare and other environmental and sociopolitical factors. Especially in the aftermath of Roe V. Wade in the U.S., this element of choice in fertility is even more vulnerable for women/AFAB people. It\u2019s interesting to think about whether this trend will change if a similar policy isn\u2019t reinstated in the U.S. As a population ages, this also has effects on the expectation for work and on the overall social and political beliefs of the country. A common criticism of political figures (members of Congress, the House, etc.) is that they don't represent the U.S. population because they skew older. As populations age, it might take longer for certain beliefs to change or shift.",

I wonder why the rates are lower for countries that have the most people because you would expect them to be fertile due to the large population. This could be because of the increase of women working in the workforce and not having the time to raise children which led to a decrease in fertility rates.

I also wonder how people in Africa manage to take care of their families sufficiently. They have a high population and high fertility rates, so they have more kids, and more things to take care of. \n\n3. How does this relate to you and your community? \n-This relates to my community because the U.S. has a very low fertility rate.

We think that there is more cultural acceptance to not having children, and women generally have greater autonomy over their bodies compared to developing nations as contraception is accessible.

More specifically, countries. It depicts fertility rates within distinct regions.I'm wondering if it's already a big problem or if it's going to be one in the future. It feels like there's not much we can do about it. It seems like a pretty important issue that we need to figure out together. This could also have a negative effect on economic development because the younger population will not be able to support the older population. I wonder how China is handling this issue they are facing.Are there certain health reasons between higher and lower populated countries that causes the differences in fertility rates? In conclusion I find this data very interesting and cannot wait to read up on it again soon.I notice that the countries with larger populations tend to be below the replacement fertility line, where as countries with a smaller population tend to be above the replacement fertility line.

I wonder why bigger and more powerful countries like America, Australia, and Brazil have lower birth rates. Maybe it's because people are more focused on earning a living in those areas, and have less time to raise a family. \nThe caption of the graph caught my attention. It states that the human population will peak at 10 billion in my lifetime, and then eventually stabilize at around 2 billion. That means that I'll live in a time period that has the most humans ever. \nHeadline: POPULATION PLUMMETING OR POPPING UP?",

In the graph, it is shown that Niger has a population of 100 million and has a total fertility rate of 6.8. Niger is located in West Africa and is one of the poorest countries in the world. Therefore because of their lack of advanced technologies and good health care, they probably have a higher infant mortality rate So, if they have six kids they can assume that a few of them will die at birth if not in the first few months of their lives. In addition in less developed countries like Niger, it is more socially acceptable to have more kids. Because of their lack of education women could have kids at an earlier age therefore producing more of them. In addition, the kids can go to work at very young ages so they can help provide income for the family. On the other hand, populations like China have implemented anti-natalist policies to control overpopulation. The previous one-child policy and the current two-child policy in China, enforced by the government, have resulted in lower fertility rates. However, these fertility rates are below the replacement rate of 2.1. This could negatively affect a population because the dependency ratio would be high on older people. This could also have a negative effect on economic development because the younger population will not be able to support the older population. I wonder how China is handling this issue they are facing.\n\u201cThe Future is Babies\u201d",

However, others can also look at this graph and see how the majority of first world countries have below the replacement fertility rate. This shows that in the near future many developed countries will see a dip in populations instead of maintaining their current size. This may cause many different problems such as problems that Japan is seeing now like a larger elderly population than youth which is causing a lot of jobs to not be filled and many towns deserted because there are not enough people to live there. However the places with rapidly growing populations are many places that are not fully developed and this increase of population may help them grow and develop more but it may also limit their ability to grow as countries. The size of the circles also shows us the population of the areas that are being listed and many large circles are placed below the replacement fertility rate. These circles effect the world population the most and I think that being below the replacement fertility rate shows that the world population will take a major toll in the near future.",

Third-world countries like Niger(6.8), Mali(6.0), and most countries in Africa all have a need for kids because their countries aren\u2019t developed yet and therefore kids generate money by working, valuable money that ensures parental survival. It's a logical and necessary decision on their part, it's their means of survival.\n      However, other countries like the US(1.7) and Germany(1.5) are in the \u201cIndustrial\u201d and \u201cPost-Industrial\u201d stages of the Demographic Transition Model, meaning that they no longer have such a need for children and now have kids because of desire rather than need. However, because their replacement rate is lower than the fertility rate in these countries, like the US, immigrants are essential to replenish the workforce and ensure continuation. When this immigration surge stops we end up with countries like Germany who pay in extreme amounts for foreign workers and try desperately to increase fertility rates. It leads one to wonder, what will happen when all countries end up in the \u201cPost-Industrial\u201d and 1st world stage like Germany and Japan? Will we find a way around it?

This is shocking, as I expected that India would have a large fertility rate due to the immense overpopulation. The birthrates have begun falling everywhere except for Africa, leading to a decline in population. While this could help solve problems with overpopulation, if fertility rates continuously decline, it could eventually lead to another issue.

And below them is a pool of countries mainly from Africa and two countries that aren\u2019t. What is being shown here is that a large part of the world has stagnated in relation to their fertility rate. The only area that is still sustaining their high fertility rate, from the baby boomer years, is Africa, everywhere else has significantly dropped exempt of a couple of anomalies. This is mainly due to there being far higher placement on the need of child rearing comparatively to rest of the world as it seems that most people no either don\u2019t have the money or care to raise a child. The lower rate in child rearing in these nations can be mainly put towards financial issues and potentially the high use of contraceptives. \nContinues in Replies",

In Niger the fertility rate is the highest in the world at 6.8 while in other parts of the world like India and China the rate is only 2.0 and 1.2 which is well below the necessary replacement rate. The main thing I can notice about this graph is how it shows the difference between developed countries and developing countries, in poorer nations like Mali and Niger where it is less developed the people there are having many more children than in places like the U.S or China where the richer more educated people are having less kids than is necessary to fill the replacement rate.",

I noticed that Niger was the country with the highest fertility rate and Hong Kong, China had the lowest fertility rate. I also noticed that the United States had below-replacement fertility. Women in Niger on average have 6 or 7 children but women in the United States have 1 or 2 children on average. While most women in China have 1 child, the graph shows that women in Hong Kong have only one or no children. I wonder if the fertility rate will continue to decrease or if people will notice the change and decide to have more children.\n\nThe graph shows that the fertility rate world wide has decreased which will affect our planet negatively. If the rates continue to decrease, there will be many countries that will have a high death rate and a low birth rate which will not allow for us to replace a death with a life causing a decrease in the population. When countries try to make a policy to get the birth rates higher to populate the Earth, it will eventually cause overpopulation. Then resulting in a policy to limit the number of children the countries have which can eventually lead to underpopulation. Then this could become a continuous cycle.",

Many second and third world countries have higher fertility rates, like Niger, having a 6.8, while many first world countries are visualized to have low fertility rates, like the U.S. which has 1.7. Based on this graph, I can infer that the reason many countries have high fertility rates is because they either lack or are opposed to contraceptives, or that they practice various religious or cultural ideas that eventually result in fertility and childbirth. I wonder why lots of countries that are well developed have very low fertility rates. When I think of very populated and developed countries, like the U.S. or China, I sometimes picture hundreds of people bustling through town, overcrowded and claustrophobic. Why would these kinds of countries have a low fertility rate if they are so populated?

Not to mention the recent surge of \u201chookup culture\u201d. I don\u2019t know much about the situations in other countries, but in the U.S as long as our economy and youth stays the same, nothing will be changing any time soon. \n\nA couple things I notice in the graph is that the countries with the highest fertility rate, almost all lack female education, support very young marriages and arranged marriages. Also in these countries there is an expectancy and desire for a larger family. \n\nWhat I have to wonder is the reactions to this information from the governments, what possible rules will they set in place, and will they actually try to fix the economy? I think most people nowadays just simply don\u2019t see the need in producing children. They are very hard to afford currently, and put the mother in extreme stress and pain, and people are struggling to find long term partners.

The human population will reach 10 billion by the year 2085 and affect the world in a negative way since there will be a large depletion of resources.

The cause of such a drastic dive may be because of dwindling fertility, age structure, and mortality among the population. \n\nBased on the graph I wonder about how the world will look when it reaches its highest human population. How much land will cost and how the poor will sustain life. Through looking at the graph closely, I see that there is a large imbalance with child births leaving it with a population increase.

    "comment info": "The graph depicts how large of a population decrease there will be as younger generations grow and have children. Because of cultural, economic, and personal reasons, families are smaller than in the past, meaning that the world's population will be dropping. The graphs depict the large discontinuity in generation sizes in countries like China and India. On the other hand, the graph displays how many African countries like Niger and Mali have maintained high birth rates. All of this information goes to show how the world's cultural climate is and will continue to be changing in the coming decades. I find it interesting that the change in birth rate is shown in a negative light because I have seen many discussions claiming that the world population is too high. With issues like climate change and the housing crisis, it would seem like a positive thing to have a lower world population in the future. I wonder why the article has taken this perspective and how will the changes really manifest as my generation begins starting families. A headline for this graph could be, \"How Changing Fertility Rates Can be Managed in the Future.\"",

For one, instead of the usual bar graphs or charts, this one is circles that appear random or scattered with different words and statistics on/around them. Some are red and some are gray and they vary in size. They look to be distinguished by countries, and it is about the population and its fertility rate. The smaller the circle, the higher the rate, and fertility rates, as the graph says, are falling in almost everywhere except African countries. I wonder what the cause of the decline in fertility is, and how much more it will go down. I also wonder what effect it will have on the population over more time. This affects my community because the fertility rate where I live can go down too and it can have an effect on my population/ generation. \nMy catchy title is \"The Possibility of Infertility\"",

I noticed that countries in Africa possess the highest average fertility rate such as in Niger, Mali and Nigeria. However, countries that may be considered more developed (or contain developing economies), possess lower fertility rates that fall below the replacement fertility rate at 2.1. This includes countries such as India, China and Italy.   One reason for this may be that people are tending to have fewer children due to the expenses necessary for raising a child. This may apply to China (fertility rate of 1.2) and the United States (fertility rate of 1.7) due to financial concerns. An example of this includes child care, higher education and family leave. I wonder if governments will begin to encourage citizens to have more children by lowering costs in some areas of a country or in providing more affordable healthcare.

Africa has always historically had the highest fertility rates, mostly due to a lack of access to contraceptives and education, as well as the prevalence of polygamy and adolescent marriages. \n      As this graph shows, most developed countries, including the United States, have lower fertility rates, the majority of them being under the replacement fertility threshold. It\u2019s interesting to note that global birth rates have declined over time, which I believe is mostly due to increases in cost of living and childcare, developments in women\u2019s rights, and urbanization, all of which are particularly high in first world countries.\n      What concerns me mostly is how low fertility rates have dropped and how that might affect the population. In some places like Japan and South Korea, the birth rate is so low that schools started shutting down because they couldn\u2019t sustain the costs of the institution. In fact, it was so bad that, at any given moment, there were only one or two children actively attending a class.

The graph also draws a gray dotted line showing the ideal replacement fertility rate, 2.1 children per pair of parents, which would sustain the population shifting from one generation to the next. Interestingly, most major countries fall below the ideal replacement fertility rate. Some of which being the US (1.7), India (2.0), Japan (1.3), the UK (1.6), Germany (1.5), and Russia (1.5). Not so shockingly, China falls low at 1.2 children per set of parents, which was a goal of the old one-child policy. I wonder how this will end up affecting the economy and workforce. More specifically, how will manual labor jobs be affected? As people get older, it gets harder for them to efficiently perform hard physical labor. So, will businesses be negatively impacted if there is less accessibility to younger workers? In my community, small shops tend to rely on teenagers as employees.

I wonder why countries with low fertility rates can contain a high population size, and vice versa.

With fertility rates being as low as they are recorded many families will only have one child ultimately decreasing population around the world.

I noticed that the total fertility rates in parts of Africa are significantly higher than in other parts of the world. Particularly, Niger has the highest total fertility rate of 6.8. I also noticed that the African regions have relatively small populations and that for those regions, the smaller population tends to lead to a greater total fertility rate. On the other hand, other nations have much lower fertility rates which are mostly all below the replacement fertility rate, meaning that their populations still are not stabilized. The city of Hong Kong has a very low total fertility rate of only 0.7. I wonder why that fertility rate is so small in comparison to the African region of Niger which looks like it is compatible in population to Hong Kong. I also wonder why the birth rates in small countries of Africa are higher than countries with greater populations and think this could be due to the higher cost of having children in other countries depicted such as India, China, and Italy compared to African regions. This relates to my community because I live in the U.S. and it has a total fertility rate of 1.7, which is below the replacement fertility. A declining population could greatly affect the economy.

It is then placed on a chart that illustrates whether the country is above or meeting its expected total fertility rate, or if they are not and have a below-replacement fertility rate. Most countries meeting this expected fertility rate are in Africa while European and American countries mostly fall in below-replacement fertility rates. I wonder what the correlation between these countries is. Most countries that fall below below-replacement rates are very modern countries, so I wonder if pollution, processed foods, stress, and other byproducts of a modern life are causing this decrease.

For example Niger, a landlocked country in West Africa has a fertility rate of 6.8% while India, a country in South Asia has a fertility rate of 2.0.  I can also tell from the graph however that the rate has dropped over the years. Not only for Asian countries but for African countries as well.  Countries China and India are now in replacement because the population would stabilize if every two people had two children. Mainly saying the fertility rate is below 2.0\n\nI wonder how this would affect the population. Over the years it's dropping less and less and most countries are in below-replacement fertility.  If the graph continues over the years we might stabilize. How long would it take for the population to realize the significant impact and what it means for us.

They want to have their children survive and are willing to keep reproducing until they achieve that. Countries that are very highly populated mostly have a lower fertility rate, which could be due to the people living there feeling overcrowded and smushed together.

This relates to my community and me because if the population continues to decline, there will be a lack of work causing the economy to run slower. With fewer children, the older generation will have very little to rely on, and the present generation will have more work on their backs to be the main providers.\n4.

For example Niger has a 6.8 fertility rate with Mail having 6.0 and Nigeria having 5.2 but india has a 2.0 fertility rate and Hong Kong at the lowest rate of 0.7. \n\n2. I wonder how it works that countries with low fertility rates but still contain a high population size. Is it affected by laws in these certain countries or does the country contain a steady population with only a slight increase. \n\n3. With fertility rates being as low as they are recorded many families will only have one child ultimately decreasing population around the world. In the US specifically 1.7 children per women is still a low fertility rate which supports my claim.\n\n4.How is the world's population growing? For the better or for the worse?",

High fertility rates are required for a healthy populous to help grow the community. Most families in my community have around 2 to 3 children which is around the known median fertility rate.

In addition, this graph shows that larger populated nations such as China and India have lower fertility rates than smaller populated areas such as Niger and Mali. I believe this is because China and India are more developed countries than Niger and Mali.\n\n2. I wonder why the population around the globe is decreasing so suddenly. Why do China and India have \nthe least percent of fertility rates if they are the highest populated countries? How will this decline affect the economy of the world? I also wonder if there could be positive outcomes of this such as less competition in work.\n\n3. This relates to me and my community since families around me have at max 2 kids, in addition, most people around me do not have large families whereas, in Niger the average number of children per mother is about 7.\n\n4.

This could be due to the idea that once a country becomes more developed, women have more access to education and have a greater choice in whether they want to have children. As women become more educated and have more choices, they often choose to have fewer children. \n\nI wonder what systems the more developed countries with lower fertility rates could employ in order to increase their birth rates so that they can maintain a stable population. I also wonder how a declining birth rate could benefit countries like India that have a very high population. The decline in fertility rates could help control an overpopulated country.\n\nThis relates to our community because if we continue to have a declining fertility rate in the United States, it could create an economic issue. As the population of the U.S. ages and a declining number of babies born, we as a younger generation could have no social security money given to us when we get older because the older generations will have used up all the money apportioned for future generations.\n\nA possible headline for this graph could be \"Maybe Babies Can Fix Some Things\"",

    "comment info": "- I notice that smaller countries, mostly 3rd world (if not all) need to have more children than countries with more money and a larger surface area. \n- I wonder how many of women actually stick to this standard. How many children do most women want nowadays? \n- This relates to me because I am a female. However I am not sure I even want to have children. I'm more likely to adopt and I know many people in my generation that don't want to give birth.\n- This graph demonstrates how many children a women would have to maintain the current population. It also represents the size of the population currently.\n- A good title might be \"Quality v. Quantity, what's better for our economy?\"",
