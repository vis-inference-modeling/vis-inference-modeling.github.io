    "comment info": "I notice in the graph that financial factors appear to be the most important for both 16-19 year-olds and college grads. Affordable tuition and income potential have the greatest relative importance for both groups. For 16-19 year-olds, the school type (public/private) is the least important factor and varsity sports importance is the least important factor for college grads. I also notice that the factors with the greatest difference in importance between 16-19 year-olds and college grads are small class sizes and distance to family. For distance to family, the relative importance is about 1/4 less than it is for 16-19 year-olds. For small class sizes, the relative importance is around 1/3 lower for 16-19 year-olds than it is for graduates. I wonder why college graduates value being near family less than 16-19 year-olds. I wonder if this is because college graduates have become accustomed to living away from family and are now more comfortable or adjusted, and thus value distance to family/hometown less. Being a college student personally, I can relate to this and I believe those around me prioritize the same factors outlined in this, namely college affordability and income potential, as these can directly influence an individuals choice to attend a particular school or pursue a particular degree.

This indicates a shared concern over the financial burden of education. The gap in priorities is noticeable in the criteria of proximity to family or hometown and class sizes, with younger students placing more emphasis on family and older students placing more emphasis on quality of education. This indicates that as students mature and experience college life, their perspective on values shifts, showed by gaining appreciation for independence and personalized attention that smaller classes provide. I wonder how representative this data is across different demographics and if these priorities shift with cultural background, economic status, or region. I wonder where the surveyed 2,000 young people between the ages of 16 and 19 and the other 2,000 college graduates between the ages of 22 and 30 came from (specific city/state/county). As a college student myself, within a community that student debt is common, the importance of affordable tuition resonates deeply. The preference for small class sizes aligns with my personal educational experience at Cal Poly, where engagement and personalized feedback have been beneficial.

    "comment info": "I've noticed that affordable tuition stands out as the top priority for recent college graduates and 16-19 year olds alike, which makes perfect sense considering the aversion to attending an unaffordable college. Additionally, it's notable that 16-19 year olds place greater emphasis on proximity to family or hometown when choosing a college. Understandably, embarking on such a significant life transition prompts a desire to remain connected to familiar surroundings. In contrast, college graduates are more seasoned and accustomed to the college environment.\nIt's intriguing to ponder how long it takes for 16-19 year olds to adjust to college life and reassess their priorities, particularly regarding proximity to family or hometown. Personally, I can relate to this experience, as I, too, initially hesitated to venture far from home for college. The first few weeks away from my accustomed lifestyle were met with skepticism, yet over time, I adapted and discovered newfound independence.\nA compelling headline capturing this transition could be \"Pre-College vs. Post-College Priorities: Navigating the Shift.\"",

Affordability and future income potential dominate for both, which makes sense but is also concerning. High schoolers care way more about being close to home, while grads value small class sizes - perspectives that seem to shift after experiencing college firsthand. I wonder if grads had some huge impersonal lectures that made them appreciate smaller discussions and professor relationships.

It stuck out to me because after going to college myself, I felt I enjoyed the convenience of being able to drive home, as opposed to being forced to fly. It seems like before college, people may find it scary to go so far from home for the first time. After college, it seems less scary to move away from your family. One thing I wonder is why there is a gap between \"whether the school is public or private\" between the college grads and 16- to 19-year-olds. Comparatively, they both feel nearly the same about affordable tuition. Since private schools tend to cost more than in-state public schools, I wonder if both groups surveyed had the financial aspect in mind when considering public vs private schools. I also wonder if one group preferred public schools or private schools more than the other.\nThis relates to me as someone who went to a school by almost complete chance, and realized that things I thought were important at first are less important now that I'm in college.

I think it makes a lot of sense that graduates would value being closer home less compared to the hopefuls. The hopefuls will most likely want to hold onto the friends that they have already made in high school and be scared of becoming more independent which is why they would want to stay close to home, however the graduates, after already going through college have already made new friends and have become independent, so they realized that being away from their hometown might have actually been a good thing. The other great difference comes with valuing small classes. It also makes a lot of sense that high schoolers, who probably haven't experienced big lecture classes, wouldn't value the small class sizes as much because they don't know. In the case for the graduates, because they already went through college, they were able see why having small classes is nice relative to big lecture classes. One thing I wonder is if the students they surveyed were just students from the United States. I would be interested in learning if this graph reflects students internationally. As a current college student, I can most definitely reflect a lot of what the graduates value, especially the small class sizes.

First, affordable tuition is highly important to both age groups (above 4x relative importance).

    "comment info": "1. Initially looking at this graph, I noticed the two selected groups of people being compared (the 16\u201319-year-olds and the 22\u201330-year-olds). There were a few points of comparison where the two groups felt similarly about that specific priority and the rest showed noticeable differences depending on your age for that priority. For instance, both 16-to-19-year-olds and recent college graduates highly prioritize affordable tuition. However, regarding small class sizes, recent college graduates tend to prioritize them way more than incoming college students.\n2. I wonder why varsity sports seem to be a bigger priority to incoming students than to recent college graduates. It's also interesting that whether the school is public or private appears to have a small priority for both groups.\n3. This relates to my community and my own self because I remember prioritizing location. I wanted to be close to my grandparents and I also love the ocean, so Cal Poly, SLO seemed like the perfect place for me. \n4. \"Shifting Priorities: Comparing College Selection Criteria for Incoming and Post-College Students\".",

    "comment info": "Upon analyzing the graph, I noticed two prominent trends. Firstly, both younger and older individuals prioritize economical aspects when selecting a college, favoring cost-effective alternatives and considering future income potential post-graduation as well as affordable tuition. Secondly, younger respondents are not as willing to relocate away from family given the it is way more important to them for the college to be close to their hometown. This is probably due to the fact that since they are younger, college is more unknown to them, so they want as aspect of comfort, especially with their surroundings, while in college. One thing I wonder is why both age groups do not seem to note any significant level of importance on whether the college is public or not. This relates to me and my community because I am currently a 20 year-old in college, so comparing my ideals now vs. when I was 16-19 is very interesting. It also helps me understand what other individuals in my community appear to value compared to what I value as well as how my values have changed throughout my time in college so far.\nHeadline: \"Decisive Factors in College Selection: Balancing Economy and Risk\"",

While I fully agree with this, it is still somewhat surprising because I know that many people go into tremendous debt for college, so I wasn't sure if affordability would be the consensus most important. \n\nI wonder why being near family or hometown is more important to 16-19 year olds than recent graduates -- I would have expected that high school seniors want to finally leave their hometown, while recent graduates may have grown more fond of it after being away for a while. \n\nThis relates to me and my community as a college student because we all considered these factors just a couple of years ago. All of these aspects were considered by me, and I think the general order of importance is pretty accurate in my situation as well. \n\nHeadline: \"What Are Students Looking for Today?\"",

    "comment info": "What I notice in this graph is first that there are differences in the priorities between college graduates and 16- to 19-year-olds. In regards to how they rate the importance of affordable tuition, income potential, campus safety, distance from home, racial and ethnic diversity, small class sizes, varsity sports, and whether the school is public or private. I notice that although they place nearly the same importance on categories such as affordable tuition, income potential, and racial and ethnic diversity the other categories differ much more. This is because the other categories tend to be more solid regarding your outlook regardless of experience. 16- to 19-year-olds showed that they much more value living near home, while graduates do not since graduates would no longer be as dependent on their parents. Then regarding class sizes the 16 to 19-year-olds aren't as aware of the importance of the small class sizes that the graduates get to experience and value. I wonder why whether the school is public or private does not have more importance since that is also partially tied to whether the tuition is affordable. The impact this has on my community is that this can be used as help when deciding since you can look at the way someone who's experienced college follows things to draw from. It could impact your decisions or rank of colleges. I was once in the boots of the pre-graduates making that choice. A fitting title would be \"Pre and Post College: Differing Priorities\".",

    "comment info": "The first thing that I noticed about this graph is that affordable tuition is by far the highest priority when choosing a college for both 16 to 19 year olds and recent college graduates. This is not super surprising, since most people probably want to pay as little as possible for college while also receiving quality education. I also noticed that affordable tuition, graduates' higher income potential, and racial/ethnic diversity are the only three factors that seem to be relatively agreed upon by both age groups. For the most part, there are fairly drastic differences in the opinions of what matters for both groups of people. Something I wonder about the graph is why it seems that neither age group has much care for whether or not a school is private. In general, private schools are much more expensive than public schools, and I would have thought that this would be a high concern when choosing a college. This part of the graph also seems to somewhat contradict the high value people are placing on the importance of affordable tuition. As a college student myself, this graph is relative to me and my community. As a sophomore in college, it was not too long away that I had to take all of the factors in the graph into consideration for myself, so it is very easy for me to form my own opinions on what I think is important for students choosing their future college.

Both of the dots have a 4x relative importance. The college attribute that has the most discrepancy between 16-19 year olds and college graduates is small class sizes. I wonder how the importance of these attributes is compared to those currently in college. I also wonder why safe campus is more important to those going into college vs those who have already graduated. As college students this topic is very related to our community.

Some of these include a safe campus, how near the campus is to their hometown, and varsity sports importance. Factors that college graduates seem to care more about are small class sizes and whether the school is private or not. The relative importance of these factors is not the same for each, as it can be seen from the graph that, while teens care more for a safe campus and proximity to their hometown than graduates, the relative importance of safety is more than twice the average yet proximity is around average.\n\tI wonder what specifics drive these changes in relative importance, especially considering almost every single recent college graduate was at some point a 16-19-year-old deciding what college they would attend.\n\tThis relates to my community in that most of my friends and peers are between the ages of 16 and 19 and are deciding to go to college or are already in college, where I also have family members who recently graduated from university, so I will see how our preferences change as we age in the coming years.\n\tCatchy headline: \u201cDealbreaker?

In order of how much the answers between both groups vary: Safe campus/Public or private, importance of varsity sports, near family, and class size. \n\n2. What do you wonder?\n\nI wonder if the things that younger kids value - sports and family - change because college kids become more independent. Those who do not pursue sports as a career path may find that they do not have enough time to compete at the varsity level during completion of their degree. I wonder if also the experience of being on campus and in classes changed the minds of college graduates on how important the type, safety, and size of classes are for a university.\n\n\n3.

I can conclude that this is important because no one wants to be stuck in debt. A higher income potential is also very important to both groups. I can conclude that this is because they want to make the maximum amount of income their job can offer. A safe campus is important to both age groups. The concern of a safe campus has become a prominent discussion over the last few years with increasing gun violence. Whether their college is near family or hometown is not that important to recent college graduates but is much more important to teens who probably have a fear of moving further away from home. Racial and ethnic diversity is of mediocre importance to both age groups. Small class sizes are not nearly as important to teens as they are to recent college students. I can infer that teens do not realize how helpful small class sizes can be in a learning environment until they graduate college. Varsity sports are not very significant teens or recent college graduates but they are slightly more important to teens. Whether the school is public or private barely matters to either age group but are more important to recent college graduates. As someone who is 16 I agree with the relative importance that my age group chose with these topics and I will definitely be considering the when I choose a college to attend.\n\"College Constraints\u201d",

The topic they had the closest opinions on was affordable tuition and were most indifferent when it came to small class sizes. 16-19 year olds seem to see that it is less important when it comes to small class sizes and public or private , where the older group feels differently. I wonder if the older group was more in the parent age group to see if their opinions have changed since they were 16-19. Possibly if when adults were younger did they feel the same way high schoolers feel right now? This relates to my community because I am a part of the 16-19 age group and I agree with a majority of what was explained on the graph. It does seem that a majority of high schoolers would be in agreement with most of these and I was not surprised by them either.

The graph's priorities range from financial concerns to the importance of whether the school is private or public. I noticed both16 to 19-year-olds and recent college graduates place a high value on affordable tuition and potential earnings in their desired career after graduation. The most interesting difference I discovered was that recent college graduates cared more about their school being private or public compared to 16-19 year olds. I wonder if this is because students who went to a public university feel they would have had a better education or environment if they went to a private college. This has an impact on my community because I am a senior in high school applying to college, and this graph helps me realize that students all over l have the same concerns as I do when it comes to college. \nHeadline: What are your College priorities?",

The surveyors who created the graph compared the college priorities between 16-19 year olds and recent college graduates. Both groups seem to have similar wants, except in a few specific instances. The two topics where teens and graduates differ are class sizes and whether college is close to family. High schoolers value closeness to their family more than graduates. This likely because these students still live with their parents, and it's harder for them to imagine a college experience far away from their home. The other topic where the two subject groups differ is how important small class sizes are. Teens place class size importance low, while graduates place it at about average. This is probably because college students have had experience with the effects of different class sizes during their college education. \nI wonder where this study was conducted. I think it was probably conducted in the USA, based on how important affordable tuition is to these people. American colleges have very expensive tuition fees compared to other countries.

I notice that affordable tuition is of the highest importance to all students. This makes sense because tuition is so high today and college students spend a lot of their time trying to pay off student loans. Another high priority is the potential for higher income. In todays very materialistic and capitalistic society, it makes a lot of sense that students want to pursue education and jobs that will make a lot of money. I wonder why recent college graduates prefer smaller class sizes more than younger students do. This relates to me and my community because many of these topics, like a safe campus, diversity, and tuition can contribute to the college experience and whether it is good or bad.

The top priorities are safety, post-graduation income, and affordable tuition are some of the most important things for students after they graduate. They want to set themselves up for success by looking for a school that will keep them from harm and set them up to be financially stable. With inflation and the lack of economic stability that many high schools are seeing and experiencing, money remains a prevalent topic in college decisions. As a current senior, money and how a college will support my future have been very important to me. It is important to know that we will come out of school ready to start our professional lives, so it makes sense that money would be a majority interest for both recent graduates and current students.

I think it goes to show how affected and important money is for students in general. I think most students who go to college seek higher wages.\n\n2. What I am wondering is how they calculated relative importance and how they came up with the scale. It\u2019s interesting of how the makers of the graph used fractions. As a high school student I wonder how smaller class sizes affect students in general.\n\n3. This affects my community greatly as many people around me are applying to colleges in general and I could conduct different surveys for factors that determine college selections.\n\n4.

I notice that the main or top priority for 16-19 year olds and recent college graduates are ones that deal with finances such as affordable tuition and the graduate's higher income potential. I notice that neither of the groups prioritize whether the college is public or private school which shows that they may not have a specific preference or simply are not looking for that. I wonder why small class sizes is not that high of a priority to students. Maybe they believe that learning in a larger environment is more beneficial to learn in compared to a smaller environment. Also, despite the age and grade difference the 16-19 year olds have similar priorities as do recent college graduates which shows that these priorities determine the perfect fit for a prospective student at a college. This relates to me and my community because I go to a private school and I am applying to colleges next year and these priorities are things that I need to look at when deciding what colleges I want to apply to, visit, see myself at, etc. Also, I attend a private school and the environment is intense when applying to colleges. \nMy Super Duper Catchy Headline: The Perfect Fit",

The college graduates tended to care more about being closer than the 16-19 year olds. I think this is because as you get older you understand the importance of family. Also, most of these responders probably did move away and looking back, staying closer would have been nice because they know what it\u2019s like to miss family. Another example would be sports. Ages 16-19 care way more than the graduates about the varsity sports programs. Once you get older and into college, it you realized how difficult it is to play at that level. When ages 16-19, sports are a prime part of most peoples lives and all they seek is to play in college and go pro, however after college most see this wasn\u2019t their true dream or it is way more difficult than foreseen.

As seen, both 16 to 19-year-olds and recent college graduates hold high priority in affordability and potential income in the workforce after graduating college. The biggest difference according to this graph is the concern about class size. Both groups have low concern if class sizes are small or not, recent college graduates fall just above \u00bd relative importance while 16 to 19-year-olds dip between \u00bc to \u215b. I wonder if COVID has a role in this. Do the upcoming classes face the lingering effects of isolation because of the pandemic? Thus, are striving for larger class sizes to be surrounded by the people who were once taken away from their everyday lives? Another category that stuck out to me was the importance of campus safety. 16 to 19-year-olds are shown to value campus safety more than recent college graduates. I wonder if this is because of the increasing cases of violence on school grounds. In my community, most students I know have faced threats of weapons in school. Last May, my school had a three-hour lockdown after rumors of a suspected armed man circulated. Many kids I know, even my cousins as young as 10, talk of fear of gun violence on school grounds. \n\n\u201cSafety, Sports, Size: The Priorities of College Life.\"",

The least considered factor is whether a school is private or public. However, graduates find the public/private factor more important than undergraduates. The most drastic differences are in class size and location relative to home. After graduating, it seems that people find more importance in small class sizes and less importance in distance from home.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\n\nI wonder why, after graduating, people find less importance in proximity to their hometown. Perhaps it\u2019s because undergrads find that they won\u2019t be able to establish a proper livelihood far from home, but once they have established this (by the time they graduate), they realize that it was never a really large issue.\n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\n\nThis helps me in my college choosing decisions, especially when looking at the importance of small class sizes, affordable tuition, and potential for high income.

Still, there were also some differences as each age group considered some priorities more important than others. 16-19-year-olds have found a college that has a safe campus, is near their family or hometown, and has varsity sports more important than the recently graduated class who didn't believe they were as much. It was also seen that for 16-19-year-olds, smaller class sizes and whether a school is public or private, weren't as important, in contrast to the recently graduated class which believed it was.\n\n2) What had caused those who already graduated to have such opinions?

Recent graduates prefer colleges with small class sizes, while 16-19 year olds prioritize colleges near family or hometown. Both groups have similar views on affordable tuition, income potential, and racial and ethnicity. The older group focuses on the overall college experience, while the younger group is more interested in proximity, varsity sports, and school type.2) I wonder if having more experience causes college graduates to react differently from those in the 16\u201319 age range and similarly to one another. I'm also curious as to why they decided to reorder their priorities and if their thinking at that age was similar to that of the 16\u201319 age group.\n3) This speaks to me and the community, I believe, because many individuals will know what to look for when choosing the kind of college they want to attend after seeing data about the top priorities in college selection. This helps us understand whether or not a college is the right choice for a particular person, as this depends on a variety of aspects, including the one shown in the graph.

Or is this based on maturity and importance changes as you get older.\n\n3. As a 17 year old applying to college, I am looking for a mid size class and affordable tuition. Also I know that with out of state colleges you would have to pay out of state tuition which is most likely higher than any home state tuition so logically it would make sense for 17-19 year olds to consider that as important.",

Recent college graduates tend to favor colleges with small class sizes. Meanwhile, 16- to 19-year-olds tend to prioritize colleges that are near their family or hometown. However, both have similar views when it comes to affordable tuition, income potential upon graduating, and racial and ethnicity.\n\n2) I wonder why preferences change based on age. Do people become more open to meeting new people as they mature? Why is that? What other factors come into play?\n\n3) It relates to me and my community because I'm going to graduate this year and choosing the right colleges to apply to is key if one wants to be successful in life.

    "comment info": "- When looking at the graph, I can separate the categories into 2 groups. Affordable tuition, graduates' higher income potential, safe campus, racial and ethnic diversity, and small class sizes; these could be in one group and for most of them, it seems like the older group of people are most interested in those areas. That group focuses on the overall environment and experience of college. The second group with being near family or hometown, varsity sports, and whether the school is public or private; those seem to have more interest in the 16-19 year olds. That group is more related to specific preferences and interests. \n\n- I wonder why the data is the way that it is. Why do the 16-19 year olds care more about certain things than the 22-30 year old, and vise versa.\n\n- This data relates to me and my community because when I start to think about college, tuition is one of the first things that come to mind. That's also the same for a lot of other people as well.\n\n- In the graph, it's showing the difference from different age groups in what's more important to each group in terms of college.

It may be because they would like to keep options flexible when applying for the college and including both private and public broadens the choices you have at your disposal.",

As seen on the graph it is the furthest to the right.\n-Something that makes me curious is the difference between 16 to 19-year-olds and college graduates when speaking about being \"near family or hometown\". It seems that the desire to wanting to be close to family becomes less important once you get to college.\n-This relates to me because I am a high schooler who is waiting to apply to a college, so seeing the needs that other people of my age have from a college and comparing them is very beneficial.\n-The graph being shown helps to emphasize the needs of high schoolers to college graduates from a college, showing how high schoolers wants from a college might change over a period of time. \nHeadline: \"importance of needs and desires\"",

Do any of these criteria ranks surprise you?\n\nPlease return on Friday when we will reveal the free link to the article that includes this graph.  There you will find all 22 criteria that Morning Consult asked respondents about.  Also, there is a free link to the New York Times interactive tool to create your own college rankings.  It incorporates 10 general priorities, 3 school size filters, location filters for all 50 states plus regions and 15 other filters regarding composition of student body, fields of study, selectivity and more.  Appropriately, it\u2019s called \u201cBuild Your Own College Rankings.\u201d",
