    "comment info": "I notice that there appears to be a correlation between a baseball player\u2019s value, or WAR, and their average salary throughout their 10-year contract. I also notice that there appears to be a cluster in the middle such that most players are relatively close to the center point, implying that the average yearly salary of players is indicative of their WAR. \nI wonder why those who deviate from the typical range depicted in the graph do so. Some examples include Albert Pujois, who does not earn a lot (less $15,000,000) despite having the second-highest WAR, and Ryan Howard, getting paid $25,000,000 for having a negative WAR.\nThis graph relates to my community and me in that we can generalize these findings to demonstrate that, typically, our contribution to a team dictates our payoff. Given that it is possible that people in my current classes and social circle can end up working together with each other or with me as part of a team later down the line, it is important we each positively contribute to project efforts.\nCatchy Headline: \u201cWAR: Does Your Contract Value Your Contributions to the Team?\u201d",

    "comment info": "What I notice:\n\nThe graph compares the average yearly WAR (Wins Above Replacement) and average yearly salary during 10-year MLB contracts.\nThere is a clear trend that players with higher average yearly WAR tend to earn higher average yearly salaries.\nHowever, the relationship is not perfectly linear. Some players like Mike Trout stand out as having an exceptionally high WAR relative to their salary.\nThere also seems to be more variability in salaries at the higher end of the WAR spectrum.\n\nWhat I wonder:\n\nWhat other factors besides on-field performance (WAR) impact player salaries? \n\nAre teams getting good value from these mega long-term contracts, or do they tend to backfire as players age? Comparing salary to WAR over the full contract would be informative.\n\nHow has this relationship between WAR and salary for top contracts evolved over time as analytics and player valuations have advanced?\n\nImpact on the sport and fanbases:\n\nAs teams commit huge sums to top stars, it could impact competitive balance, roster construction, and fan perception if highly paid players underperform.\n\nHowever, building around contracted superstars allows fanbases to have long-term attachment to franchise icons.\n\nAs younger stars like Juan Soto sign massive deals, it will be fascinating to see how the market evolves and if they live up to expectations.\n\nPotential headline: \"MLB's big money bets: The relationship between star players' production and pay in an era of mega contracts\"",

Many of the baseball players are clustered around the same average WAR, with an equal number of players both above and below the WAR average. However, I appears that there are more players below the WAR average than above or right along it. Additionally, a few players, such as Albert Pujols, Alex Rodriguez, and Miguel Cabrera, have more than one contract. I wonder why, for players with two contracts, such as Albert Pujols, Alex Rodriguez, and Miguel Cabrera, their WAR is higher during their first contract but drops significantly in their second contract, while their salary increases in the second contract. This may be because these players lack motivation after getting such a huge boost in salary, or even simply that just the older they get, they tend to slow down. This relates to me personally as I currently work for a college baseball team, see taking notes on more in-depth baseball statistics really intrigues me. While it may not have a great affect on my community as a whole, my personal interest and work environment leads me to enjoy this data. \n\nHeadline: \"Baseball WAR: The Battle of Performance in Relation to Salary\"",

For instance, Mike Trout started playing in 2009, while Kevin Brown retired in 2006. This makes it impossible for this chart to have been, at any time, accurate to that time. This means that this chart has to have been compiled recently, but before people like Ryan Howard retired. Additionally, this graph had to have been made before March of 2019 because Mike Trout\u2019s salary has drastically changed since this chart was created. On a different note, when I look at this chart, I break it into four pieces, the bad players with low salaries, the bad players with good salaries, good players with bad salaries, and good players with good salaries. In these four groups, I see two main categories, the fair and unfair deals, the good players with good pay and the bad players with bad pay. These sections are fair because the managers and the players get exactly the right amount for what they pay, money and labor. On the other hand, the other two categories are unfair because either the player is paid to much in which case they might be released, or the player is paid to little in which case they might quit.

I am also surprised because he has a lower WAR than Mike Trout but still gets paid more. I think this is because Zack Greinke is a very important asset to his team.

Does favoritism play into how these players get drafted from college and from other teams? I say this because quite a few players who have lower WARs get paid more than players that have higher WARs. For instance, David Price who has a WAR of 3  is paid more than J.D. Martinez who has a WAR of 7.

    "comment info": "Baseball doesn't interest me, but I do find this graph fascinating. The first thing glaring out is Mike Trout's WAR to salary ratio. He is the \"best\" player out of everyone in the graph, but he does't get nearly as much money as Zack Greinke who has a close-to-average WAR. Furthermore, this is the same case with Albert Pujols. He has the second most WAR in his first contract, but his salary is below average. As he reaches his second contract, Pujols has a significantly lower WAR, but higher salary. Why is this the case? Finally, I see that Ryan Howard has a negative WAR number. How can someone be that bad? On top of that, how can someone that bad get a higher salary than the hardest, best player (Mike Trout)? This confuses me, but I think this shows how not everything is fair in life. Some people get granted advantages. Some people don't. If I were to name this graph, I would call it \"The Cost of WAR.\"",

An example is Zack Greinke, who gets paid the most but barely has an average WAR value. In contrast, Mike Trout, who gets paid not nearly as much, is so much more valuable of a player.\nI wonder what this graph is supposed to show besides their salary compared to their WAR. I wonder why the people who get paid more, are not always the best player. Why is it that, Albert Pujols, who gets paid the 4th lowest amount, is so high in WAR.\nA headline would be, \u201cDoes a Player\u2019s Salary, Reflect Their True Skill?\u201d I think this would be good because this graph here is pretty much explaining that.

Another question that I have is if Mike Trout has the highest WAR which is between 8 and 9, how is he not paid the most? There is a similar issue other players including Alex Rodriguez and Albert Pujols. Even though they don\u2019t have the highest WAR, they do have a large amount, so I would expect them to get paid more than they do. Another thing about this graph that stands out is that a lot of the players who have a low WAR are paid the average yearly salary or more. I don\u2019t get this because players who have around the same WAR are paid different amounts. The amounts vary by a lot. For example, Carlos Lee and Yoenis Cespedes have about the same WAR, but one makes less than the average yearly salary. If I had to title this graph, I would name it WAR vs. salary.",

One thing I do understand is that some of these most paid baseball players are not as good as they should be. One thing I do understand is if players have fallen off they shouldn't be paid so much. There are so many players out their dreaming to become like the champs, and some of these legends play on these teams for the money. Take an example of Lebron James an amazing athlete, he had to options to join the Sixers or the Lakers, he decided to join the Lakers due to the amazing amount of money where he could maybe won the championship in the Sixers.",

This would show that is much rarer for a good player to come along and sign a contract for a lot of money, than for a more average player to come along and get signed a low to average amount of money! I am very interested to see the reasoning behind why Miguel Cabrera was signed for a lot more as he got older and not as fantastic. He was signed for much less when he was better. Maybe the Tigers were desperate! Zack Greinke is average, but signed the contract for the most amount of money on the graph! He is a pitcher though, and he might be more valuable to the Diamondbacks than other players!

I wonder if this suggests that the players in this region on the graph are potentially overpaid for their contributions (or lack thereof) to their team. For example, Ryan Howard has the lowest WAR on the graph at about -1, but he makes about $25 million per year from his contract, which is well above the average yearly salary of about $21.5 million. If this is the case, why would the graph creator choose to highlight this region in particular? Do they want people to question whether these players deserve the huge amount of money they are making?

Maybe to save space the chart placed popular baseball figures, yet that would not be true, as Ryan Howard is no longer an active MLB player. Does not being on the chart mean that they are not good enough, not be a free agent (I doubt being a free agent would affect who would get on the chart), or not paid a high enough contract to be on the chart? The name for this chart would be Medal of war recipient.

As a person who enjoys baseball, but hasn't gotten into stats and things, I don't understand what this is for. I also wonder how they get these WAR stats.\n\nA title I have for this may be The WAR for pay.",

(Hint:  Notice the WAR label.)\nThese are players who have played or are playing under contracts of at least $100 million.\nHow is WAR calculated?
