The upper middle and above classes tended to have the largest amount of doses supplied, whereas lower middle and below classes were found to have had the smallest amount of vaccines given. It was also interesting to note that the size of the circle on the graph were representative of the population in a given country. This was not really a impacting factor, as some small populated countries, like Chile, have a high income with the largest amount of vaccination doses. Contrarily, larger populated countries, like India, are lower middle income with a significantly smaller number of provided vaccinations.\n\n2. What countries fall astray from the expected vaccination numbers based on their wealth? I\u2019d like to know where poorer versus richer countries get their vaccines from? Do wealthier countries have more treatments done because they have a greater impact on the world\u2019s economy?\n\n3. This relates to me because I live in a wealthy country where vaccines are more likely to be available to me than in poorer countries. Not only is my whole family vaccinated, but the greater population of myhigh school is almost fully vaccinated as well. The easy access created a safe environment quickly when there was a lot of panic in the world.\n\n4. Hefty Vaccinations With A Heavy Correlation",

The number of doses given may also correlate with the trust in the government. Some of the Middle-eastern countries that received 50 doses or less per capita are run through a dictatorship; therefore, their inhabitants may not trust them to give a vaccine. I find it interesting how European countries show to have given more vaccine doses than the middle-east. Is this because of financials, dictatorship, or access? I also find it interesting that China is closer in the cluster to the United State and Europe rather than India since they have about the same population size.

Although, the middle-class countries have the absolute most that have been distributed. As you see higher on the graph, fewer and fewer countries have high doses. The mid to lower dose numbers show the most in the high-class countries. The size of each country also seems to play a part in how many doses can be administered. It looks like the biggest countries in each class have close to the highest vaccination doses.\nI wonder if the reason the lower-class countries can't get doses is because of the low amount of money to supply them. I also wonder in what ways can we help to support the lower and low-middle class countries to increase the number of doses. How quickly can this issue be solved?

I also notice that each income group corresponds to a different color of the bubble, and the low-income countries have the least vaccinated amount of people while the upper-middle-class countries have the most vaccinated people. Along with the color of the bubbles, the size of the bubble signifies the population of the countries. One thing that I find interesting is that the upper-middle-class countries have more vaccinated than the high class, and I wonder why that is. Another thing I notice is that the countries with small populations (or smaller circles) occur the most as low and high income. I wonder if the reason that some places have fewer vaccinated people is due to the amount of funding there is or if it's because of religious beliefs, hesitancies of the vaccines, or mistrust of governments. I also wonder what the death rates look like compared to the number of vaccinated people, if they are higher or lower in places as a result of how many citizens are vaccinated.",

I say relatively strong because after Chile there is a dip in the graph, and from there, a downwards trend. Seeing significantly less populated countries like Australia and Spain have a higher dose per capita than the United States makes me wonder why it is like that. It\u2019s not like the United States doesn\u2019t have the resources or money to administer vaccinations, but the decision of allowing people to decide if they want to get the vaccine is frankly, quite dangerous. This makes me think about what I heard on the news yesterday that roughly 63% of the United States is vaccinated. It\u2019s upsetting to know that people in the United States refuse to take the vaccine when people in lower-class countries, like India, would appreciate such an opportunity. While I understand that some people may have medical restrictions that prevent them from getting the vaccine, some people just do not believe in the vaccine. I also wonder what the upper-middle country is that is above the 250 line. This relates to me because vaccines are an important part of keeping not only myself safe, but those around me.

Lack of government trust is widespread; however, some countries such as those in the lower and lower middle class pay the price when they do not have a positive relationship with their government.  There is not enough income to sustain life as government issues progress thus resulting in minimal assistance when it comes to global crises such as Covid-19.  With that being said; in the United States however, lack of government trust is not as much of an issue as there are enough people with the wealth to have access to vaccinations as they are more independent in that aspect.

Therefore, this a strong correlation between the amount of wealth and Covid vaccine doses. This could cause a higher rate of Covid for less wealthy countries, which means that hospitals with lesser funding would be overflowed with patients. However, the highest and wealthiest countries such as the United States may have citizens believe that the hospitals are well equipped and funded which may lead some to believe getting Covid is not that bad or that getting it is inevitable. The middle to upper-middle classes with vaccine access may also be a factor since the working class does not want to take time off of work if they get covid or have to pay hospital bills if they get it, which means they are more likely to get the vaccine due to this factor, especially in countries such as Brazil and Vietnam with higher vaccination rates and average-higher income.",

The population size does not affect the administered doses per country because the size of the circles vary inconsistently throughout the graph. \nI wonder why the curve flattens at the top, meaning the highest income countries have the same vaccination rates as the upper middle income countries, even though up until upper middle, the trend line increases considerably.\nThis relates to my community because I am from the U.S., which falls low on the graph considering its wealth and population size at around 140 doses per capita. In my area, getting vaccinated is a debatable subject, because not everybody trusts the vaccine, even though it is available to them. This makes it clear that in the US and perhaps other wealthier countries, the problem is not supply and demand. Instead, the problem is the politicization of covid precautions in the US. \nCaption: Wealth keeps your health: Wealthiest countries aren\u2019t using all of their vaccines?!",

And with that, countries with a lower gdp tend to have lower vaccination rates, like Kenya, Nigeria, or Afghanistan. I also seen that there is no specific relation between the size of a country and it\u2019s vaccination rates, because the vaccination rates are mainly determined on the countries wealth/gdp rather than size. But I can wonder if countries size, could somehow determine whether it is easier to have more doses per capita, because it is easier to vaccinate the majority of a smaller country like Spain, rather than the United States or China, even though all these countries are at a high gdp. This can relate to me and my community because this can bring us to awareness that we have such a better opportunity than most countries to be safe, and if we have an opportunity that benefits us that other countries lack, we should take advantage of it. Getting educated on our country and others helps us learn what\u2019s going on around the world, and how wealth can determine vaccination rates which is very interesting to me. The graph shows us how COVID-19 vaccination rates vary enormously by country due to many different reasons, but a connection between the differences is the wealth/gdp of a country.

As seen from the graph, there is a linear trend that shows that as the graph goes rightward both Gross Domestic Product per Capita and the vaccinations per 100 people increase. From this we can conclude that  vaccination availability almost directly correlates with that country\u2019s GDPPC. Countries on the lower half of the GDP spectrum usually have less doses per capita.\nWith this being said, I wonder why many of the countries with high GDP tend to be outliers on the graph and don't continue to have more vaccinations. For example, South Africa and China have similar GDPPCs but are so far apart when it comes to the amount vaccinated. Could this be due to varying opinions or views on vaccination in these countries?\nThis relates to me and my community because it resembles the steps we need to take in order to fit into the graph and do our part. We have too few vaccinations compared to other countries who have similar or less of the GDPPC available. Chile is a great example of what a country should strive to accomplish, they're ratio of vaccinations to GDPPC is much higher than many on the list.\nThis graph compares a country's Gross Domestic Product per capita and the amount vaccinations per capita in order to see the correlation between the two.

This can be affected by many different forces, such as infrastructure which could transport the vaccine, cost of maintaining the vaccine in freezers, advertising the vaccine, and even social effects such as anti-vax groups or just general concern by the public.\n\n How come there\u2019s a sudden dip in the doses administered by capita in countries with more than ~$20k GDP? With their wealth, they should easily be able to distribute the vaccine and advertise the vaccine well into the community. Not to mention the probable widespread hospitals, clinics, and other organizations that are in these countries that can administer the vaccine.\n\nIn my community, there are a few amount of people who aren\u2019t vaccinated, but more haven\u2019t gotten the booster. Anti-Vax propaganda isn\u2019t a huge problem in my community, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s much more affluent in other states and even other countries that are modernized (my main hypothesis as to why super high GDP countries have a dip in doses administered by capita). With the current culture of my community, vaccines are seen as very important and necessary to beating this pandemic, so I\u2019d be willing to guess that right now our doses per capita is much higher than national average.\n\nWhy aren\u2019t the modernized super-rich countries leading the way in vaccine administration, as much as they should be?",

In short, the general trend the more money your country makes the more vaccines are going to be administered. I wonder why most of the very high GDP countries stay at a similar level of medium level GDP countries, since a linear correlation doesn\u2019t seem to work for the high GDP. I also wonder why many of the high GDP countries seem to be clustered together, while countries like Brazil and South Africa are so far part in vaccinations, despite having similar GDPs. \nAlso, the amount of people in a country loosely correlates with doses administered per capita, but only within similar GDP groups. For example, India, with the second most populous country in the world, administers more doses per capita compared to less populous countries like Kenya or Nigeria, even though they have similar GDPs. I wonder if this has to do with population density, since the doses being per capita would seemingly negate the population correlation argument.\nI also wonder if this can be scaled down to certain regions of a country. For example, could this graph be done but with the fifty states? Would the trend be similar or different? Would reproducing similar scaled down versions in other countries (and maybe even smaller regions) produce the same results?",

For example, a poorer country with a relatively high dose administered per capita, and the wealthy country, with a high-earning income group that has a relatively low number of doses per capita.\n\n2. I wonder what these two countries are, and what causes them to be outliers. Aid from other countries? A possible political stance against vaccinces? Higher percentage of medical conditions that prohibit, or make it more difficult to get vaccinated? Furthermore, there is another outlier. A country with an upper middle class income group that dwarfs the richest countries in doses administered per capita. Why is this so? Who are they?\n\n3. This relates to me and my community as it puts us into perspective against other countries on where we are in the process of vaccination. This can help us understand where we can improve, and where we might be able to help other communities, or countries improve.\n\n4. This graph illustrates the correlation between a countries wealth and the doses of COVID vaccine administered per capita. An important distinction to make is that this is not a graph of a country's wealth and their capacity to vaccinate, as this graph takes into account external factors.

The lower the GDP of a country, and the lower the income group, the less likely that country is to have people vaccinated against Covid-19.

That vaccines need to be kept at a certain range of temperature. There also needs to be enough medics to administer the vaccine.

The countries that have a higher average national income buy more vaccinations in general. Because the wealth of a country seems to affect how many vaccinations a country purchases and acquires in general versus the population, I wonder if receiving COVID vaccinations is actually relatively independent from a supply and demand chain and is actually more akin to accessibility through wealth (how many people need the vaccine versus how many people can actually afford it). I also wonder about the sociopolitical demographics of the countries because I don\u2019t know all of them, but I do know that many of the countries who have administered many doses of the vaccine have relatively socialist governments in nature or have a relatively blue party leading over it.

I wonder what are some of the tiny dots of high incomed countries with small populations near Polland are since they seem to all have high incomes but low vaccine doses administered.\u00a0\n\nI think this relates to me personally since I live in the United States currently but I can tell that even with a relatively large population, the United States has lower vaccine doses administered than other larger populations. Also, the fact that the United States is also one of the high-income countries, having low vaccination doses administered would probably be a problem in order to keep all of the people involved in the big population safe.

    "comment info": "In this graph, I noticed that is a direct correlation between the wealth of a country and the doses of vaccines administered. For example, Guinea's GDP falls slightly below $1,000 and it has received less than 1/3 the number of doses as the United States with a GDP of amount 100,000. This correlation is most likely because countries with a higher GDP have the ability to spend more money to purchase vaccines.\n\nI wonder why the highest-income countries do not have the most doses administered, but instead, the middle-income countries do. I would hypothesize that this is for one of two reasons. First, not as many people in these countries agreed to get vaccinated, or, second, the countries have the supply of vaccines but do not have the proper infrastructure to administrate them.\n\nThis relates to me and my community because as someone who lives in the US, I have seen firsthand the new regulations going into effect with COVID. With many employers, schools, and private companies requiring vaccinations, I am surprised to see that the US still has fewer doses administered than Australia, a country with a much smaller population.\u00a0\n\nThe headline I would create for this graph is \"Vaccination Inequality: The Truth About Vaccine Distribution\"",

I notice that some lower-middle countries have administered more vaccines than some upper-middle. I think the lower-middle countries have higher vaccination rates than the upper-middle countries because they are bigger and therefore have a larger population. The upper-middle-class countries have the highest vaccination rates. This is because they are the most financially stable countries so they can afford to buy and administer vaccines to their citizens.

The graph only uses four colours to represent the income groups but the bubbles overlap making it somewhat hard to distinguish where in the income group the country is. Like that one very tiny dot inside India. \nI wonder why only some countries are labelled? Are there any outliers? If so which countries? Does the government deal with the vaccination rate? Why do the high income countries go down in vaccination rates? Is it because of the smaller populus,  or is it because of people's choices? What country is above the graph?\n\nThis relates to me and my community because the United States has less vaccination rates than other countries that have less income and more people.This would make it much easier for herd immunity to fail. Which means that the virus can spread much easier.

Countries such as the United States, Australia, Japan, and Spain have administered more doses to their population compared to lower developed countries, such as India, Pakistan, Nigeria, and so on.\n2. The question to be pondered upon is why poorer countries such as Burundi have administered few doses. Despite the international cooperation between states to supply doses to poorer countries, it is evident that countries such as Burundi, Afghanistan, and Mozambique have administered very few doses to their actual population compared to the rest of the world. Is this due to an internal affair or because of international issues?\n3. This relates to my community and I because it shows that the United States still lags behind competitors in terms of vaccination. This is largely attributed to the political debates over vaccination in the United States; for example, when compared to China, which has a higher population, its Communist government is able to more effectively control its people and vaccinate at higher rates. However, it should also be noted that in many democratic first world countries, such as those in Western Europe, vaccination rates do not lag far behind China.\n4.

Yet I wonder why some countries who are considered wealthy aren\u2019t valuing the thought of vaccinations, like other countries are.

These results can impact or even relate to many people, but this chart relates to myself and my community as I can witness the understanding of how my specific country appears to be accurate.
