Yes, the experience helps with understanding how things go in the office, but the fresh eyes could be a good thing. There is a lot of corruption in the political world that can cause presidents to be afraid of offending anyone and sugar coat things. In life sugarcoating can only lead to false hope. There have been many successful presidents that have had years of experience in different positions but the economic stance that Trump has these have lacked. He was able to beat out a women with years of experience, even being the first lady. It will be interesting to see what more comes from this lack of experience with Trump's next term.",

Politically, he is a moderately extreme Republican who wants to put guns in American\u2019s hands and jobs on American soil.  His goal of his presidency is to install The Wall on the United States-Mexico border and put an end to illegal immigration.\n\nThe graph shows he hasn\u2019t had any political or militaristic background before his presidency.  He is a rookie in the political field but still managed to earn the presidency upon his first attempt at the job.  He beat out Hillary Clinton who held many credentials: the former Secretary of State, former Senator of New York, and First Lady of the United States.  Donald Trump is opening the way for a new generation of presidents, celebrities with followers to attest to their \u2018greatness.\u2019  Is the love from their fans enough to secure many more similar presidencies in the future?

America wanted someone different, and we got them. Trump was appealing to many \u201816 voters just for this reason. He was different and was \u2018uncorrupted\u2019 and hadn't had political journey\u2019s and like the standard candidate would have had. This was viewed as a huge positive for many, and a major downfall for others.\n\nI am wondering what will happen this election. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, if elected, will be the only president to hold a mayoral position before taking office. Andrew Yang, who is simply an entrepreneur, also has a chance at becoming the second president ever without any military or political experience.\n\nPolitics and the media change with society. Maybe our nation was looking for a clean slate, with Trump. But, will we desire the same thing in the next election? It will be interesting to see.",

He has no previous experience in the government, while every other president has had some kind of involvment with it prior to election. It truly reveals how different this presidency is from any one that America has undergone before.

The yellow dots go across the lines in the center of the graph in the same manner the years go across the top of the graph. Is there a way to make a relationship between where the dot is and the year? \n\nFor instance, President Obama has a yellow dot next to the year he was elected (2008) but his line also has a dot that would correspond to a date in the late 1800s.  I wonder if there is a way to make sense of those two points plotted so many years apart?",

In addition,6 of 7 of the candidates have served in the field of politics at least once. This graph also shows that Trump did not have much experience in politics. Does this suggest that Trump is not qualified for his job?

It would be interesting to see how many of these people went directly from one position to the presidency. \n\nPart of the advantage for the incumbent is that it places value on the experience garnered in the position.

I think that having experience could be a good and bad thing. Having experience will help you understand the way things work a little bit better, but all of these other roles that are presented are very different than being a president. I think no matter how much experience you have, unless you have been a president, your past experience really doesn't matter because being a president and being a governor or senator are two very different things.",

The yellow dots represent the presidents, and the yellow dots with the black lining represent most recent president with that previous position. Most of the candidates that became president were former governors, senators, or cabinet members. This may be due to the incumbency advantage, as candidates have a better chance of being elected if they are already in office, because people know them and will endorse/support them. That is why there has only been one president, Trump, who has had no government or military experience. I do wonder why house members are not a popular previous position of presidents, but as far as the lack of Vice Presidents becoming president, this is probably because history has proven that VPs are not successful when they attempt to run for president.",
