I also notice that for most states near the border with Mexico have more Hispanic dishes than any other, I also notice that there are trends with some states that are close to each other. Fore example, Nevada, Idaho, Wyoming, & Colorado all show \u201cfrog eye salad\u201d as their popular dish. In addition, I notice that Illinois which is extremely far away from Hawaii has \u201cHawaiian salad\u201d as their popular dish. I wonder if certain areas of a state were surveyed more than others, this is also a connection to my community. For instance I have never heard anyone around me or anyone that lives around me say they were making or eating stuffed artichoke for thanksgiving dinner. So I wonder if the results from other (less populated) areas of each state are the ones being shown in this graph. I also wonder what would the graph look like if the result for these other areas would be on the graph, I think that if the results for California were divided into two like lower and upper than the lower region would have a Hispanic dish as a result. Also, I can point out that states with a lower population have more agreement on the most popular dish.",

I wonder what the people in each state searched up exactly and what they were thinking while searching these things up. Many of these dishes look questionable to be favorite dishes, such as frog eye salad, snicker salad, and spinach maria. My guess is that these dishes are the least common or least liked in the certain state or in the U.S. in general.

I think each state having or relative areas having their own unique dish makes Thanksgiving more personal. It is fascinating that some neighboring states have the same popular dish whereas when you look at the west coast Oregon really ventures out of the box with its vegan mushroom gravy. I wonder how these dishes came to be? Were they passed down throughout generations or are they new dishes that suddenly became popular? I also find it endearing that during Thanksgiving every state can come together and enjoy themselves over specialty foods. I think because of the pandemic hopefully people are going to try and social distance, so maybe this Thanksgiving could be a fun time to try some dishes from other states!",

Maybe I might be uncultured in what America actually eats on thanksgiving but i think other people can also relate. I noticed that some foods  such as different types of salad; snicker salad, fruit salad, frog eye salad, and cookie salad, have a top mid portion hearth in the U.S around the states North and South Dakota, and Montana.  Different assortments of pie are also common along the north east. The state in which I am living in also has a dish called \"stuffed artichokes\" which I've never heard of before or even seen how the dish looks like. Frog eye salad seems to be prominent in the mid western part of the U.S and my only question is what weirdo would search up \"frog eye salad\" and actually try it. This map also slightly hints at how culturally diverse the population. The only dish that I would actually be excited to try would be the smoked salmon drip; just for my vitamin D deficiency:) It also sound delicious and I prefer savory and umami flavors rather than sweet or sour.",

Such as Mirliton Casserole,  Pig Pickin Cake, Cream Cheese Corn, and Pretzel Salad. I wonder if these foods and many others are popular in each state (or most searched) because of the foods that are advertised in each state. I wonder if a determining factor of these searched dishes is the food that people have access to, and if that depends on the type of foods they can afford, how much of the food is at the grocery store around Thanksgiving time, and/or what is in high demand. An impact this map has on my community would be opening us up to trying new foods this thanksgiving. Since many of us will be home with immediate families, we can try out one of these new recipes with them.

I wonder why so many states claim to have salads has their most popular dish but they are actually dessert food, such as cookie salad, snicker salad, or Hawaiian salad. And why most of these are midwestern states. I don't think which foods a community enjoys for Thanksgiving has a large impact because there are many different cultures throughout the United States, so each household will have a different meal spread.

Lastly, I also noticed that pies seem to be more common on the east coast compared to the west.\nI wonder if the foods on the map are only popular  during Thanksgiving. I would assume that the pumpkin flavored things on the map are only popular during the season, however the salads that seem to be popular may be popular all year round.\nLiving in New Jersey it is interesting to see that the most usually  popular food is stuffed artichokes.

However, some food mentioned in the graph like frog eye salad, snicker/cookie salad, or funeral potatoes are food that some would even consider \"weird\".

Many dishes are the combination of different senses and flavor of sweet and salty, creating a very diverse range of food.\n\nWhat do you wonder? \nHow were these food created?

I wonder if for someone living, say, on the West Coast of the country understands the concepts on the dishes in bordering states, but is more confused by the dishes on the East Coast. I also wonder how these dishes originated and became so popular in each state. This impacts me and my community because it shows that all different states have differently foods and cultures and I think this is so interesting. I think the diversity of the very different foods goes to the show the diversity of the United States and its make-up of so many different cultures. It also impacts me because Massachusetts' most popular dish is mashed butternut squash, which I've never had, so I think I have to try it!

It is very interesting to see how many states go for a side to eat at the actual part of dinner and who chooses to go for the dessert portion for the night. One thing that really stuck out to me was the frog eye salad, the fact that it popped up twice on the map is so mind-boggling because I never even associated frog with Thanksgiving. I think it is very interesting how many different options and sides that people choose to eat at Thanksgiving, especially the ones that you wouldn't have thought of because of your geographical placement in the United States. I wonder why there is not a single this googled for plain mashed potatoes because people can make those so many different ways.

Also, I'm surprised by how many foods on the map I don't know.\nWonder - I wonder what frog eye salad, snicker salad, funeral potatoes, and 4 layer delight are. Also, I wonder if what people search for in google is what they are actually making or if they are searching for it for some other reason. \nImpact on community - Usually, for Thanksgiving, I go to Springfield, Massachusetts with my moms side of the family, but I have never had mashed butternut squash. Because of Covid, this year I am staying home in Philly. \nI can't think of a catchy headline. :(",

        "comment info": "@Deniol Billa Great answer! In response to your point about different regions sharing one type of food: I think the most prominent types of food are most probably related to the culture and way of life in their regions. For example, in the 1900s, the Northeast was home to cities, factories, and retail workers. City life moves fast, so salads (a food that can be eaten quickly) might reflect the fast-paced city life. The southeast is also known for its large families. Casseroles are typically dishes that can be shared between many people. I infer that this might be the reason why the southeast's favorite Thanksgiving foods contain a lot of casseroles.",

Snicker salad and smoked salmon dip, sound kinda delish though.\n\nWhat I wonder:  Honestly from a History POV the reason why some Thanksgiving dishes are popular in states is that the dishes apply to the state\u2019s history. Like in Florida, the popular dish is a Spanish dish.\n\nImpact on my community, and others: This goes to show that Thanksgiving is not all about Turkey and Gravy. There are more options than the basic meal.",

Is there historical context involved? Or are they foods that people usually associate with the locations? There are very intriguing names, Pig Pickin Cake, Snicker Salad, and Dirt Pudding.

I wonder what made them think of the idea to ask each state their favorite food. A catchy healine could be \"All Around\" because each state is showing their favorite food.",
