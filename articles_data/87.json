While this money was needed to keep the economy from crashing, it certainly contributes to the problems we are seeing in 2022.\n\nI wonder what would of happened if we didn't provide individuals and families with the majority of the money and focused more on funding healthcare? Would our economy of collapsed? Would we of been able to stop put an end to COVID faster?\n\nWhile this doesn't relate to me directly, it relates to my friends and those around me. I had a friend who was a lifeguard at a pool that closed during COVID which entitled him to unemployment benefits. I watched him not work at all and make more money than he ever has before. However, as a 16-17 year old who doesn't have a strong understanding in financials, he spent it all.\n\nThis graph shows how the $5 trillion of pandemic stimulus funding was distributed. We can see that individuals and families were at the top of the list and healthcare was the smallest area that had a dedicated section, even though you can argue health care funding would of been the most important. The graph also indirectly shows the government's priorities and the political agenda of those with power.\n\nA catchy headline for this graph would be \"Did Money Solve, or Create a Problem?\"",

First, I wonder if the low amount of U.S.P.S. loans has something to do with their lack of funding from the government. In 2020, the lack of U.S.P.S. funding was a prominent issue, and the data could reflect this. Also, does this \"businesses\" sector include small businesses?

    "comment info": "In the Graph you can see how the congress' $5 trillion stimulus bills as a response to COVID were distributed into the US economy. You can see how individuals & families ($1.8 trillion) and businesses  ($1.7 trillion) were provided the most amount of financial aid. This funding was provided to help individuals who are either unemployed, potentially due to the pandemic, or have an insufficient stay afloat during this time of economic instability through stimulus checks and unemployment benefits which make up a large portion of the funding for individuals and families. \n\nI wonder how funding is typically distributed and whether or not individuals and families are usually such a large portion of annual government budgeting and if it isn't whether that is something we should change. There are high poverty rates throughout the US and specifically in large cities like Oakland so it is important that when constructing budgets and stimulus bills these issues should be addressed.\n\nHeadline: Congress's Covid relief Stimulus Bill's Priorities",

COVID hit individuals who live paycheck to pay check and small businesses that barely break even really hard. Quarantine had people staying at home as much as they could so people who couldn't make enough money to stay open and who didn't have enough savings were forced to close. The money went to help they hold out until people went outside again and helped people who live almost paycheck to paycheck pay for rent or bills when they lost their jobs or had hours cut. I wonder how much the economy was actually stimulated with the money distributed. In my community, there are quite a few small businesses who had to close their doors since they couldn't make enough to keep the physical stores, I hope that the stimulus money helped a lot more stay open.

But then there is the other side to it where health care is, for many people, inaccessible due to its expense. \n4. What is the government really spending its money on?",

This may be only part of the changes we are seeing towards economic policy due to the pandemic.\n3 - The most noticeable impacts are 1) the economic changes due to the pandemic itself and 2) the direct (but rather small on an individual level) stream of money coming in the form of stimulus checks. Other impacts, such as unemployment and inflation, can be attributed to some mix of both the pandemic itself, and the government's response to the pandemic. An interesting impact which I see is that many who have not lost their jobs have started investing in the stock market due to the stimulus checks. Due to us being in uncertain times, a lot of that has gone into large companies with relatively \"safe\" stocks. In my opinion, this leads to very low amounts of economic \"stimulation\", for it's cost in inflation.\n4 - \"Pandemic Response at a Glance.\"",

Regarding the graph I noticed that it is firstly divided into 5 primary categories, being businesses, individuals and families, state and local aid, and health care, and within those categories there are more specific supported areas. I was surprised to see how much aid was given to the individual rather than larger aid systems such as businesses and health care. \n\n2. I wonder if it may have been better to supply more aid to organizations such as businesses and health care, however that aid would have to be put towards the individuals under those businesses. I believe that this may ensure that the aid being given would be used proactively rather than it possibly being spent on unnecessary things. \n\n3. The COVID-19 pandemic greatly affected a lot of the small businesses in my community alongside my smaller school. Many of the family owned restaurants in my village had to close down for over a year or sell out their business to a larger branch. Also Personally COVID-19 halted many of my personal progression. This pandemic didn't allow me to as explore extra circulars and explore my future options after high school with the shelter in place mandate, which effected me greatly.\n\n4.

For example, in the individuals and families category, most of the $1.8 trillion went to stimulus checks and unemployment benefits. These were important to provide people with because lots of people lost their jobs because companies were struggling to stay open during the pandemic. People needed money to support themselves. Another example would be how the $1.7 trillion allocated to businesses went to paycheck protections and economic injury disasters. This makes sense, because lots of companies were struggling to stay open and pay their employees. When they received stimulus payments, they could keep their employees and stay open. I wonder why the health care section did not get more funding. Although $482 billion is quite a lot, health care is very important during a pandemic and putting more funding into it would allow for processes, like developing vaccines, to be faster and more effective. With more money, they can spend on more materials. This relates to me and my community because a lot of people were impacted by the pandemic.

This is interesting to me because I expected there to be a much higher focus on that sector, considering it is a global pandemic and I feel it should be a high priority to focus on eliminating the spread of the virus. While education, businesses, and individual families are important, I would have expected a more even spread between the four sectors. This relates to me and my community because I know people who had their business affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and as well as that I know the effects that it had on people's education. Businesses had difficulty staying afloat during this time period, and as a result a lot ended up going out of business due to the extended lockdown. In addition, I know personally that I felt worse doing virtual learning as opposed learning in person. However, if more money was given to the healthcare sector, they could have avoided this completely by cutting off the pandemic when it started, and this could have been achieved by putting more time, effort, and financial aid into healthcare.

If these sectors are different in size, would you expect them to receive the same amount of funding?\u201d  In addition, I suspect that funds for each of these were also included in other sectors plus the Build Back Better Act, which is stalled in Congress.  Keep noticing and wondering.",

I wonder how did the government was able to do this and if some of the money was misused. This relate to me and my community as we seen the pandemic and everyone was getting stimulus help from the government. In this graphs they'r separated depending on what the money went to and it breaks down the different sections, and includes how much money each little section used.",

    "comment info": "I noticed that the second lowest funded sector was Healthcare. I thought this was interesting seeing how most of our concern and reason for the stimulus bill was due to the Covid-19 pandemic. I wonder hypothetically if we could go back with what we know now and how the money was spent if the stimulus bill funding would have been allocated differently. This relates to my community and I because it shows how the funding was spread and what areas were most important. It feels like the stimulus spending was meant more on keeping the economy up and running rather than helping plus up the health care section. In this graph, the amount of funding that was in the stimulus bills are portrayed by amount and sector they were used to assist. \"Stimulus check? Money now, Inflation Later.\"",
