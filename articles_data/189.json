If we do not change this huge gap in a span of about 20 years there will be some countries that will feel that they are so advanced that they do not need to be allied with anyone and believe that they don't need to obey anyone and once they believe that i believe that that would lead to a full on world war 3 and ultimately the destruction of many powerful and weak countries.",

The next country in line which is China is a mere fraction of the US\u2019s budget. \n\nI believe that a good portion of that money goes towards soldiers pay, veterans, medicine, transportation, etc. but still this makes me wonder where all that money goes and also if it\u2019s worth it. If the money is going towards nuclear weapons then I simply don\u2019t get it, I doubt I would anyways. There are already more then enough wepons of mass destruction to kill all of humanity and make earth a barren waste land. Even if this is not the case I am still wondering where all the money could possibly go. \n\nSeeing these statistics on military spending really makes me question what sections of the government like NASA could do with that budget. With these resources NASA could finally fund many of their groundbreaking concepts. I recently read of sail like  satellites that use lasers to propel them forwards at the speeds close to 20% of light speed. To this point in human history we have only reached 2% of light speed. These ships if launched today they could essentially reach Alpha Centauri system which isn\u2019t the closest solar system to outbid own. This would be a monumental part of history and it could really work, NASA simply doesn\u2019t have the budget. So I wonder again is all that money towards the military worth it?\nI name this: The cost of \u201cdominance\u201d",

This is largely due to the idea that we are one of the largest and most powerful economies in the world, thus we need to be able to protect it; plus our military is a key part of our country's identity. We are the nation that fights for freedom, thus aiding to the idea that more weapons is better because it supports our nation and the conservation of it.",

It can seem insane that the United States is paying so much on its military while not engaging in any large-scale conflicts. However cutting down on our military budget is not as easy as it sounds. \n\nNATO's military expenditures, which come predominately from the United States, hold up the new world order. The militaries protect vital supply chains while restoring and establishing stability and democracy.\n\nAlso, it is important to note that the United States is by far the richest country in the world in terms of GDP with China in second. From this perspective, US and Chinese expenditures don't look quite so large.\n\nUnfortunately, since the fall of the Soviet Union, European NATO members' military expenditures have dropped off also. However, with rising Russian aggression, it is still important to maintain a strong defense budget. I agree with President Trump's pressure on other NATO members to contribute more, so the US does not need to carry the brunt of the financial burden.\n\nThe United States needs to do all it can to uphold its post-Soviet era position and values. While its military is expensive, free and global trade, democracy, and political stability in many parts of the world may not be possible without it and close coordination with NATO countries and other US allies.",

We are followed by China, who spends $215 billion on its military, and thirdly by Saudi Arabia, who spends $87 million. Upon analyzing this graph, I wonder if there is a correlation between military might and having a prominent, influential position on the world stage and in international affairs? I am also curious about why there is a proposed increase of $54 billion when we already outnumber the runner-up, China, by $381 billion? Given that the number is so large, I would like to know precisely where all of this $596 billion is going, or how it is being used. Also, how does this amount of spending compare to the spending in previous presidential administrations? Going along with that, why might we spend more (or perhaps less) on the military than in previous years? Ultimately, this graph is endeavoring to communicate the notion that military strength is a priority. Perhaps the massive quantity of money being spent on the military  indicates that foreign relations are not very smooth, and even that war is eminent.  \n\nHeadline: When is Enough, Enough?",

The size of the circles seem to represent the amount of military spending each country partakes in, possibly excluding the United States because the circle would likely be too big. It looks like the color represents spending as well- maybe a darker green symbolizes more spending. The bars compare the United States to the next seven countries, emphasizing the fact that the US spends more than the next seven countries combined, and every country besides the top 8 spenders combined. The graph also shows that the US spends double the next country (China) does.\n2) I wonder if any other countries are proposing any bills that would put them further up. I\u2019m also wondering why are we specifically spending as much as we are and is there any way we could spend a couple billion on other systems in the us that would help in other areas (possibly more education spending?)\n3) The United States is spending too much!",

Although Trump's tweets span from Fake News to Hillary Clinton, and everything in between, the US military is quite prevalent as he tweets about it often. Trump uses twitter as his \"bully pulpit,\" and informs masses about current news and does so using less than 280 characters or less. I appreciate the fact that the military is being talked about frequently, being a United States citizen. \n\nHow does this relate to the graph you must be wondering? It is evident in the graph that the United States spends a lot of money towards its military. In fact, the United States spends the most in the world, as shown in the graph. With this being said, since the United States spends so much I feel as though United States citizens have a right to be informed about the military. President Trump has taken strides to inform the citizens about the military, in an unconventional way. I appreciate the President's actions in keeping the country informed about the actions of the military.",

Considering how the United States prides itself on it\u2019s abundance of freedom and liberty, it was no surprise that the U.S. sends a massive amount of their budget on ensuring a powerful and very capable military force; however, it is surprising to see that even seven of the world\u2019s top spenders on military do not compare to what the U.S spends on their military.\n2. The graph is able to clearly illustrate where countries have their priorities. Other countries such as Finland, focus their energy on education and thus have the most successful educational system in world. In contrast, according to the graph, the U.S. concerns itself with first protecting it\u2019s citizens and thus will stop at little to nothing to ensure the best protection that they can provide, justifying the massive spending on military.",

The United States clearly is the biggest spender of all of the countries presented with a spending of $596 billion, with a proposed increase of $54 billion. China follows with a spending of $215 billion, then Saudi Arabia with $87 billion. The designer of this graph used a creative tactic of dedicating the largest circles to the countries that spend the most. This allows the viewer to identify these countries more efficiently. Personally, I feel that this graph can spark a debate among Americans. Should this much money be spent on the military? Clearly, our country faces many problems: lack of jobs, homelessness, hunger, etc. Should more money be dedicated to solving these issues, rather than spending an absurd amount on the military alone?",

Others argue that military spending is not only incessant, but also unnecessary. I notice in this graph that the United States- in 2015- has spent $596 billion, while the next seven countries on the graph have only spent $567 billion altogether. To top it off, the rest of the world- in its entirety- only spent $514 billion. I wonder if pro-military spending politicians see this graph and think of patriotism in a positive context. Likewise, I wonder if anti-military spending politicians see this graph and think of nationalism, in a negative context.

Once money is allotted to people, it is often difficult to take it back out. At this point, do you think the government would be able to find a way to still function at its full capacity with less funding? On your point about China, its economy is still booming because of all of the manufacturing it does, and thus the country is one of the world's most profitable. Therefore there is a large amount of money which is available for taxation, and therefore military spending.",

The way the United States funds their military, to have the best Air Force, and Naval Force, makes me wonder why countries like Russia, and China do not spend more to compete with America, as they would be at a slight disadvantage, because of how the United States has more strength. The way the United States, uses their money creates a safer society for the citizens of America, as the military is defending their freedom, peace and justice.\n2. The United States having an expendable military force, allows them to have control of places that they normally would not have, like places in Japan, Australia, and parts of Europe. The United States are able to do this, mainly because they have spent so much money on their forces. Since the United States has some control of places out of their reach, it allows for safety, for the citizens of the United States, as they know that their military is able to protect them.  Because of the money that the United States put into their military, it shows that the United States, is a country that really means business.",

I am curious to know why they have such a higher spending given we have not done many war related moves in the world. Most of the time countries provide more money to their military if they are in a war or preparing for war so knowing that the U.S. is consistently spending increases leads me to believe there is a larger concern that the American people should be worried about. This amount of spending could be spent on more important departments of the government in America like education or agriculture and even employment programs. \n2. Another thing that interests me is how this money is being used specifically in the countries who spend the most like the U.S., China, and Saudi Arabia. Is the money going towards resources like more artillery or is it the technological advancements that people are creating so they can be more powerful military wise. I also question if the U.S. has specific investments that we have had to increase spending so much in so little time. There is no reason to fix something that isn't broken or in this case spend money on useless things.",

As far as I know, there isn\u2019t a looming threat of war upon the country, so maybe the U.S is trying to establish global dominance.\n\n2. Why can\u2019t part of the military fund go towards addressing poverty instead? The nation is under a serious debt, and because the proposed increase is 54 billion dollars, the national debt will increase. The U.S is obsessed with excellence, and I wonder if global excellency is the true motive instead of actually protecting the country.  There has to be a better solution on the spending of the U.S military as we already have the largest military in the world.

If America finds it entirely necessary to spend $596 billion dollars and their intentions are solely placed on the well-being of their citizens, then they are committing no crime. However, if a country like China is pouring out its money on military spending because they want to show off their army and their weaponry then they are not serving its citizens fairly. Military spending is not a light subject because it may cause a larger amount of fatalities and catastrophes when taken without precaution versus when a country is leading its citizens to their deaths.\n2) I appreciate that much larger populated countries like India and Russia are not focused strictly on military spending because they spend far less than the United States. However, they should not follow in America's footsteps because then they too will be lost in a patriotic fantasy with the citizens in the military losing their lives, citizens scared for their own safety, and leaders carelessly observing. The overall lesson for these countries is to make enough time to discuss a military budget and a strategy that will work effectively and not take away the lives of citizens that believe they are in the military to save their country. Yes, people in the military know that they have a high chance of dying or gaining an injury but it shouldn't happen time after time, trial after trial.",

I'm wondering, why is the US the country that is spending the most of their money on Defense if there is 1.386 Billion of people living in China and only 325.7 Million living in the US, yet China is 4.25 times bigger than the US.\n\n2. In my opinion, the US spends billions of dollars in their Defense, which only increases the National Debt even more, because they want to be \"prepared\" if a war is to start. Even though they have started and participated in numerous of wars, such as the Mexican War, WWI, WWI, Cuban War, Iran, and Afghanistan, in the past and ruin a lot of countries.",

Is this an attempt to make an impression of strength? Are other critical areas of their home lacking or balanced enough for them to do such? The common ground between these top-ranking countries is the level of threats they feel are being proposed to them. Rather than using their money to steady what is weakened in their economy, they feel as though defense is a better option than a country who could be better educated and technologically advanced.

Because the graph is from 2015, it makes me wonder that if the United States spent that amount of money four years ago, then the amount that they spend today is most likely very close to reaching a trillion dollars. Furthermore, if this much money is going towards the military, then how come the United States is not putting so much effort into providing money to fix roads, public education, health care benefits, and poverty? All of these issues are more or just as important than the military, so how come there is rarely nothing being done to fix them?\n\n2. When looking at the seven following countries that are shown on the graph, they all add up to $567. Because the majority of these countries help their citizens by providing them with the help and the programs that they need, could it be that they do not need to spend that much money on their military because they have them covered with everything that they need to survive? For example, in the United States, the military pays for their soldiers college tuition, which could be a reason why they need that amount of money. However, in France, they give their citizens free college tuition, which could be a possibility to why they do not need to have as much of a budget compared to the United States.",

The U.S. is the first to jump at any particular issue that needs some sort of military action and since that has been the case since the 1940's all of the allied countries in NATO look to the U.S. every time something comes up. \n2. The budget of the entire nations spending can usually be ignored because most of the states do not rely on the federal government for the funds required to pay for different projects in the communities of those states. The states run their own governments and have their own tax regiments so the debt of the nation does not affect the functionality of the states themselves. The design of the United States government itself is almost genius. For a majority of the time  the central government does not have any part in the way that the states run themselves as some of the states are self sufficient and could even become their own successful country is removed from the United States. 4 prime examples of this are California, Texas, New York, and Florida. These states all have the necessary resources to live on their own and the budget that the central government sets for the military does not affect any of these 4 states in the slightest.\n3.

I notice that the U.S. spends more money on its military than other countries with larger populations do, so I don't see how population could play a role in how much money should go to the country's military. If a country like China, which is much more densely populated than the U.S., can support their military with at least $215 billion, then adding to the $596 billion already spent is just excessive.\n2. I wonder if any proposals as to what else the $54 billion should be spent on will be taken into consideration. Instead of adding to the money spent on the country's military, the money can be used to help shelter the homeless during the harsh winters.",

The United States spends more money than the next 7 countries combined by 39 billion dollars. I am curious as to why America has to spend so much money and if they are getting necessities  and taking very good care of our military or if they are spending money for unnecessary things because we have the money. I also wonder how does the military get this much money to spend per year and why are they using $596 billions dollars for the military if a country that is way bigger in population  not even spend half of that amount. Also India only spends 51 billion dollars a year and the population is over 1 billion and America's population is 325 million people. And another question is if this money that we are giving to the military,is it being used the right way. \" Are we giving our military too much money?\"",

One thing I wonder is, do we spend anymore on anything else other than our military and how much money do we have?

As seen on this graph that was shown, it appears that the United States is the country that spends the most on its military, which dwarfs the other countries on the chart, including the nations biggest arms battle competitor Russia. Especially when there is a proposed increase of 54 billion, I feel like the nations are simply spending money unnecessarily on the armed forces. Since the budget of expenses is basically the entire world's military budget if not more combined, excluding the top 7 behind the U.S., this not only drains the nation's budget but also can put the country into more national debt. There has to be a better solution on the spending of the United State's military such as cutting the budget short as we already have the largest and strongest military in the world. This way our nation can use the other leftover funds to contribute to other departments and spend it on necessities such as helping hunger, putting people in homes, and saving the environment.",

I wonder why because some of these countries have strong militaries but the cost is still a lot and a huge difference.

We aren\u2019t even the biggest country yet we spend so much compared to the whole world combined. The US spends about $596 billion while the whole world combined (not including the other countries named) spends $514 billion.\n2. I wonder what we are spending so much. Is it weapons or just having so many people in the military? I want to know if we could cut down on costs and still have a great army. These are achievable things, people just have to pick up their heads and realize how damaging this could be.\n3. What\u2019s going in this graph is it\u2019s showing how we are spending all our money. Other countries are being more resourceful with their money while America is pouring it all into one thing.\n4.

If it truly concerns you to the point where you are worried that America will be part of the third world war or something outrageous like that then vote if you have the chance. We, as American citizens have the right to vote in order to influence the direction in which America is heading in. Don't be a bystander, instead see what you can do for your country.
