I don't believe that we get nearly enough rainfall to be considered at risk for hurricanes.\n2. Secondly, I wonder what this graph would correlate with. To elaborate, would states with higher sea level risks have more people who own boats? Or would people in CA--who are at risk for wildfires--be more likely to own a fire extinguisher compared to people who live in hurricane risk areas.\n3. Finally, although this is completely irrelevant to the graph, I wondered why counties are shaped the way they are. The division of people into smaller classifications than states makes little to no sense to me, and the fact that there are counties in states like Nevada that are almost four times the size of my state boggles my mind.",

The thing that I noticed is the chart is a big threat which is Water Stress coming in first, our second threat would be Extreme Heat, and then our third is Extreme Rainfall. But the main issue I want to talk about when noticing would be Water Stress. Water Stress to me most likely is about our water quality, water shortages, and water scarcity, which is a lack of fresh water. I wonder if this threat will be settled in the near future, and if it doesn't will we ever find a way to have drinkable water? This will impact me and my community because everyday, some people drink water to either be dehydrated, to help our bodies, or just be pleased with their lunches with water. If there is no more water then the question is, what are we going to drink? We can't keep drinking sodas because they're made from carbonated water and carbonated water is made from water. It's possible to stay alive without drinking water for a few days most likely, but that wouldn't be more effective to us. In the graph, water stress is a serious threat and is probably going to happen to other countries soon. A catchy headline that I can think of is, \"What's going on with our water supply?\"",

The first thing I noticed is that though the charts are based on climate threats and what not, natural disasters are overlooked. Earthquakes are a big part of California\u2019s disasters especially since the sea level is rising. Since San Mateo\u2019s sea level and water stress is very high, earthquakes could enhance more natural disasters like tsunamis and flooding, Of course we can\u2019t forget about the frequent wildfires that constantly ruin our environment and air quality. My only question is, if California is always in danger of droughts, why is the water stress so high? In California there is little to no rain, with the exception of rainy winters and snowy areas like Lake Tahoe. I do wonder if it\u2019s because San Mateo is located on the border of the U.S where many oceans lie. Earthquakes, wildfires, and  flooding play a big factor in many homes here. Although it\u2019s sad to say, San Mateo County is poor and many communities would not be able to recover from big disasters like these. The graph is a perfect representation of our biggest climate problems and exhibits what we can do to help our community move forward.

And I also noticed that Hurricanes are impossible to happen in this part of the US. I wonder what they mean by Water stress. Does it mean droughts, tsunamis, a decrease in the rain? I think this has an impact on my county because it can limit our freshwater supply or we wouldn't have enough rain which can cause more wildfires.

Once I looked at my home state (North Carolina) I see that we have almost every risk, with the exception of wildfires and water stress. As someone who  lives on coastal Carolina's, hurricanes are really common, though I guess 2020 felt bad and let up a little. The north east of the state is at risk of sea levels rising. More than half of the state is prone to hurricane risk. Then the western part of the state is prone to heavy rainfall. If you look very closely, the far west of the state is prone to heat stress. To add to that if you look and go from east to west, the colors change in order which I find really interesting. The colors shift from dark green, to light green, to dark blue, to light blue, or pale orange, to full orange.

I also notice that the west and east have completely different climates. The west coast is prone to fires, heatwaves, and extreme rainfall. The east coast, on the other hand, is prone to extreme rainfall and hurricanes. Though they're obviously so different, they're not that far away, and it is fascinating how something only 3000 miles away can have a completely different climate. I wonder why most of the midwest suffers from droughts & water stress. Though it is expected with climate change, I wonder what exactly makes such a difference. I also wonder why some areas of the color \"sections\" have different climates mixed in them. Look at California, for instance. They have a small section of extreme rainfall risk, so I wonder why they have rainfall, of all things, next to wildfire risk. This has an extreme impact on me and my community.

What I mean by this is that certain people who make more that $40K might have it better off than others who are below the poverty line. Yes, both sides will have to struggle during the events of the climate, however it is a guarantee that people who come with more wealth will be better off than others. Things such as the essentials are needed in a climate crisis, as an example in a state such as Arizona or Nevada, an essential during the event of a water stress would be water, and so people who are under the poverty line might not have access to those necessities.  \n3.  The effects that a climate threat of hurricanes can have on my communities is that many people might have to go without power for weeks upon weeks considering that certain areas in Connecticut will be taken into more consideration rather than others. \n4.

Most of the states on the East coast have a hurricane risk whereas many of the states on the West coast have a water stress risk. About half of California has a wildfire risk, which aligns with recent events. The risk that covers the most area would be water stress as it occupies the Midwest and parts of the West and South. However, since the Midwest is more sparsely populated compared to other parts of the country, I'm unsure that water stress affects the most people. I noticed states that are at risk for hurricanes or extreme rainfall are states that border or are very close to the water; landlocked states tend to be at risk for water stress or extreme heat. I wonder what specific factors of climate change cause each risk and which risks cause the most damage. I also wonder why most of Hawaii is at risk for extreme heat rather than sea level rise considering that Hawaii is a chain of islands. Similarly, I wonder what causes certain counties to be at a different risk compared to the rest of their state. My community is at risk for hurricanes, followed by extreme rainfall and water stress. This aligns with the weather that we experience.

The west coast is most at risk for wildfires, with extreme rainfall as a close second. The areas in the midwest have high water stress levels, probably because they are landlocked. I wonder what this cause can people who are on the coast. If they live close to the ocean, their housing may be threatened, and I wonder if they are already taking measures to reduce the potential effects. This topic has a direct impact on our community because from the graphs, it shows us what the current problems/conditions involving climate are most relevant to our county. We can see that there are both water and heat stress risk for Hennepin County.

We noticed that Missouri and Illinois have the most extreme heat. We also noticed that Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky have the most extreme rainfall. In addition, we noticed that Alaska has the most sea level rise. We learned that water stress reflects the change in drought-like conditions.

The water stress section covers the most area and is in the Midwest.  the extreme heat is centered around the industry's in the plains.  the wild fires are spread in the northern part of California and north eastern part of Arizona.  The hurricanes seem to be along the eastern seaboard and the south coast.  Alaska also seems to be having the worst time with sea level rise and the mid to north east is under the extreme rainfall risk.\n\nI wonder why the water stress and extreme heat are so close to the extreme rain fall.  I wonder this because the rain fall would help with the water stress but excessive rain would create run off so the ground would be able to obtain some of the water coming down.   \n\nThe impact that this has on the county's states and country are that these climate problems can really screw up this planet and country.  The problem of climate change is a serious problem and individual people cant change it you need lots of people to change it.\n\nA good title might be \"From state to country to world the environment is falling apart.\"",

The northwest area is experiencing high risk of rainfall, California and Arizona areas have a high wildfire risk. A large portion of the west is in a drought because there is a high water stress in that area. Hurricanes are in the region that they usually are-the water borders of the south, but there's also a hurricane risk that climes all of the east coast and up north which is interesting. There's extreme heat on the eastern side of the midwest, (I don't know if that's the right terminology.) There is high risk of rainfall in the ohio valley region, states surrounding pennsylvania and new york, and a small part of the northeast. There is also high rainfall risk in parts of the south. In some places that have high rainfall risk, they also have seas rising like  washington and alaska. I wonder why the rainfall is where it is. Why isn't the rainfall coming to the midwest? I guess I wonder why the some climate risks are where they are. Some of the climate risks have their reasons (climate change) but other ones, like the rainfall, I wonder, is it just luck?

The same is also true for most of the Pacific North West though because of the Pacific Ocean.  There is also a high fire risk in places that are known for droughts and often extreme heat, such as Arizona and Northern Califonia/South-Western Oregon. The areas with extreme heat stress risk are also clustered together and slowly disperse. I notice that Hawaii is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean has both high heat and sea-level rise risk. I also notice that Alaska has portions with high risk in all of the listed categories except for wildfires and hurricanes which I find interesting because Alaska is majorly coastal and has lots of forests. I also notice that northern Washington has high rainfall risk despite not being directly on the coast. I wonder if these results are recent especially the ones in California, with the most current ones started by a gender reveal party (it would probably be beneficial to stop having them as they can be very harmful and extremely are cis-normative). I wonder why there is water stress risk in  South Western California when it is coastal and not a portion of California as affected by wildfires.

Extreme heat hits the central-eastern parts, succeded by extreme rainfall and hurricanes near the coast.

While the west coast is experiencing rainfall, wildfires, and water stress, the east coast has hurricanes and rainfall. On the other hand, the midwest is undergoing massive water stress, some extreme heat, and few parts of wildfires. I can infer that due to the many volcanoes that Hawaii includes, the weather has high heat stress. Within these categories, the severity in lighter or darker shades are shown in each county. For example, Shasta County displays darker red, meaning very high risk of wildfires. Neighboring it, is Lassen County showing a lighter shade to depict the lesser risk than Shasta.

The feature of searching a county and having it automatically highlighted is convenient. I was easily able to find my county and discover that we are experiencing high risk of wildfires and water stress. With the recent wildfires, our community was severely impacted.
