Food Production in the US will dramatically start to decrease within the next few decades, due to labor shortages. Relying wholly on mechanization or immigrant labor will not be sufficient and we will not be able to meet the food demands of the developing world. The population growth rates of some in the developing world, are linked to access to Western grain and corn imports. If and when these decrease, there will be massive famine in Africa. It's attenuated and counter-intuitive, but it will happen.\n\nAfrica will have a huge population of younger working-age population. But they will not be able to reap any of the benefits of this, because food imports, medical aid imports, all these things that Africa needs from more advanced nations will be pulled back and decreased, as these older nations go into a cocoon-like state of demographic hibernation. Africa may suffer greatly when this happens. Or, perhaps, they will immigrate to a de-populated Europe and America and find sparsely populated vacant cities, farming fields, and abandoned industrial plants---all just waiting for people to man the levers of production.",

To support my opinion, the china in the graph turns yellow which tells that the old people\u2019s population is bigger.

This effect is occuring again now, with the second wave of generation X teachers.  \nNow I am retired and writting a book, titled Echo, the effects of the Baby Boom.  And its not pretty.  I believe population data in the US is flawed.  I believe we are about to experience somthing like never before, where the replacement rate is so low, and the older boomers are about to die in an upward spike (as they were born) causing massive upheavals.  In 1995, I went down this rabbit hole of what if's.  Image a day, soon, where a business has requires 100 workers, and on that day 4 retire, and only one is available to hire. And the next day, 8 retire, and only one is again, availble to hire. By the third day, the business must shut down.  Schools in the Northeast USA are shutting down for lack of teachers AND students. Because the birth rate dropped since 1975, the US population is simply getting older.

Similarly, South Asian countries such as Pakistan and India won\u2019t reach a majority of older people by 2050 and instead have a majority of working-age individuals.  North and South American countries also don\u2019t have a majority older population, but most European countries gradually go from a working-age population in 1990 to an older population in 2050.   \n\nI wonder what factors impact this change; why do countries with high populations, such as India, continue having such a high population, but the age diversity doesn\u2019t change? What variables haven\u2019t the 2050 graph taken into account? How much will economies change based on the age distribution? How will federal systems to support senior citizens change in countries that will reach a majority older population?  Why do European countries experience such a drastic change in age distribution? How long will it take countries that haven\u2019t reached an older population by 2050 to reach it?\n\nThis graph reflects the current lifespan averages of these countries, which is important to our community to understand better improvements that need to be made.

In specific areas like China, it is evident that there isn't an exponential growth in births and is limited by a factor causing it to hold a more older population. On the other hand, Africa contains more of a younger population at the time of 2050. The economic growth by 2050 would not be the same in these two countries since a country like China would not be able to keep up with the new norms while a country like Nigeria wouldn't be old enough to fully understand economics.\n\n2. I wonder if future generations will start reproducing at a larger rate due to the increase in an older population. Would society lengthen retirement age to compensate for future generations. Specifically look at the graph, what exactly is going on in Africa for the overall population to be young. \n\n3. Currently, like the graph the population in the world is nearing or in the working age.

Only a few locations in the continent demonstrate populations of working age. Compared to the other continents it can be seen that generally places where there were younger populations in 1990, like the Americas as well as Asia, as the years passed to 2023 became working age, and so on to 2050 as the populations grew older. While in Europe, a lot of the population at working age in 1990, estimated to 2050 grow to be generally older populations. \n\n2) I wonder for locations where there is a surge in the younger population but a lack of older and working populations, will there be too many children but not enough adults? For the opposite, where there are large expected older populations, will there be issues in finding younger populations to care for them? \n\n3) As communities will each have to comply with their needs, some will probably need more schools for children, and other communities, nursing homes for the elders, this may require help from international nations to help cover these finances.

It shows that every country except Africa has had or will have a shift in the age population, transitioning from a younger population to a working-age population by 2050. Furthermore, the predictions for 2050 suggest that countries like China and Europe will transition from a working-age population to an older population. Meanwhile, Japan will continue to have a high proportion of elderly residents, as it has since 2023.\n2) I'm curious about governments' strategies to meet countries' needs/new standards as they transition from working-age to older populations. Also, when will these plans be implemented, and will any proactive measures be taken in response to the anticipated changes in the population's age? \n3)This will impact my community and me as in the future, China's working-age population as of 2023 produces goods imported to countries like where I live, the U.S., but as China's transition to older population will cause a decrease in our Global economy, and inflation may rise.\n4) The Unavoidable Reality: More Old People Than Young People in the Future",

I notice they are not only all graduated symbol maps, which are displaying the population size of each country, but that they are also showing the country's average age distribution. In each map every country's population get's increasingly larger, and most country's population gets older as well. Although African country's are an exception, as their average population's are staying young.\nI wonder if populations getting older is related to the worldwide advances in sanitation, hygiene, nutrition, and medical discoveries. I also wonder why African country's populations are staying young, even though the population is growing as steadily as the aging populations. I think that this graph is displaying different country's vary in population growth as well as the average population age and the connection between the two. This relates to me and my community, because in 2050, I will be working age. The graph predicts that in 2050 the population will be older than working age, which suggests a high dependency ratio, and that younger and older populations will depend on my generation. That is not beneficial for young, working, or older populations, and will negatively effect our economy.  A headline that envelopes this graph is \"Younger populations on a decline\"",

I noticed that there are 3 graphs depicting/predicting the age distribution amongst young, working-age, and old age groups in the past 1990, the present 2023, and then the future 2050. I also noticed that in 1990 the population was mostly younger and working-age people and the dots on the graph were more sporadic but in 2023 there are now older people as well as young and working-age people and more dots on the map graph because these populations have grown larger. I wonder what caused the age distribution around the world to change over time. Could the cause of the change in age distribution be the result of immigration/migration or people reproducing and growing the population? Will the 2050 graph prediction be accurate?  This relates to my community because my community is filled with people of all different age groups making it a diverse and balanced community.

The population age distribution in 1990 was mostly young, with superpower countries being working age. By 2050, it is projected for more of a mix of old, young, and working population ages with the old concentrated in the West, South America, and particularly East Asia (China making up a large portion of that). In contrast, Africa's high birth rate is projected to continue to create young populations across the continent, with increasingly more countries showing up on the map. Southeast Asia and the Middle East are more steady in population age than other regions. These regions developed into a working population by 2023, and are projected to remain mostly the same.\n\nI wonder why South America is more similar in age distribution to the West rather than the Middle East and Africa. Is it related to political/economic instability vs. the exploitation of natural resources?\n\nThis relates to me and the younger generation because we are not having children at the same rate as the older generations, because of a perceived lack of stability (economically and politically).\n\nCatchy headline: Baby BUSTS Across the Globe!

In most densely populated regions of the world such as China, where the colour of the circle representing its population has increased in size and its colour changed to yellow, from green in 1990, or Europe, where the number of circles has increased and their colour has changed to yellow. I wonder if the population circles are meant to be placed in the center of every country, or in the most dense regions inhabited by humans in all regions, disregarding country borders. I also wonder which countries already face economic stress and potential stagnation as a result of this. This information is important because it demonstrates which regions are/will be suffering from being sustained by an older and smaller workforce, which can lead to widespread negative effects in the long term economic stability in these regions, which can potentially lead to various related crises, which can then lead to harmful consequences imposed on these populations. In my case, the stagnation in population density in comparison to other powerful nations, coupled with the workforce age average rising, signifying an older population in my home country, is alarming and brings up concerns for the nation's future and ability to sustain a decent quality of life.",

Along with this I noticed that as.the years go by the amount of green and orange dots increased and the blue decreased. However, in some countries the amount of dots increased but did not change color, compared to other countries whose dots did change color but didn't increase in amount.\n2)I wonder why the population concentration increased so drastically in Nigeria and Ethiopia yet the population concentration in the U.S and Brazil had little to no form of population increase. Is there a reason why some countries populations didn't increase meanwhile it did in other countries?  Why are some countries predominantly older populations yet some of the others are composed primarily from younger populations?\n3)This relates to my community and I because the graph shows that was the years go buy the United States will high a high population of elderly or retired people and a low population of younger and working age people, meaning that there will be less people available to work.

It went from nearly fully empty to nearly fully\u00a0filled.\n\nWhat do I wonder?\n\nI wonder why the population concentration increased so dramatically in Africa. What factors played into people going there or what factors allowed people to live longer to more greatly populate the continent. Additionally I wonder in the mortality rate for birth went down, resulting in more healthy babies being born. I wonder why the mortality rate for older people is also decreasing.

Now, compared to the predictions for the future, I'm amazed.\n\nI interpret the predictive graph of 2050 as such: India's population expands impressively, and the general populous remains of working age. China experiences a decreased population, and the national average features older populations. There's a population boom in most areas of central and southern Africa, and most of Europe becomes older generations. North America and South America remain largely unchanged - aside from the aging of their population. \n\nI wonder, after writing this, how accurately the world will follow the prediction. In addition, I'm curious what might cause the world to deviate from the prediction. What sort of global tragedies, such as wars or more pandemics, might change the population or age distribution of the world?

What I notice is that Africa in the 1990's has very small and young populations, but as time goes on, their population grows quite a bit, while staying young. China's population is stable, while gaining in age. Europe continually grows older. India grows in population between 1990 and 2023, but stays roughly the same for the 2050 projection. The age and population of the small countries surrounding China and India grows slightly, and the US maintains roughly a working age and grows in population very slightly. \n\nWhile we age, so does Europe.",

In 1990 the worlds population looked way less dense particularly in North and South America. It looks as though the Chinese population live a longer life or aren't having children as much as other countries. The African population looks very young, they may leave as they get older and find somewhere else to live. This would make the the population mostly younger people. I also noticed that the Americas aren't very populated compared to most of Asia.  I wonder if  Asia will have a lot higher percent of older people after 2050. In theory if they all die then the rest would be younger right.  Americans also seem to be  getting older so we may turn into China.

This might contribute to great economic growth in India. Additionally there are 3 graphs and as the years go on we can see the bubbles increase in size which represents the growing population of the world. In the graph I notice how Africa relatively remains unchanged. Despite the growing population seen in China between 2023 and 2050 the population switches from working age population to an older population . I wonder if this is what China wants when controlling their population and if it will be detrimental to China's economy. This affects my community because in the US the population switches from in 1990 from a working age to in 2050 being in between working age and older population. This shows that the younger generations birth rates may be dropping resulting in are community becoming oversaturated with the older generation.",

However, in the predicted year of 2050, the majority of the working population is older. \n\nRelevant questions: Why does this trend occur?

I notice in more developed countries, the population is generally getting older, while in less developed areas, like  Africa, the population is getting younger. I also noticed that as time goes on, the circles indicating population also get bigger in Africa but either stay generally the same or see a small growth in other places. \n\nI wonder if the larger amount of young population in Africa is due to lower life spans caused by a lack of medicine and resources like birth control. In contrast, I wonder if the increasing majority older population in China is due to the one-child policy, which caused the younger generation to shrink significantly. The reason the population shifted older in most of the rest of the world might also be due to people giving birth to fewer children, less often. \n\n As the population shifts older in countries like China and America, the number of working-age people is dwindling in comparison to those in retirement. Soon national economies could crash because there are not enough people working to support them. The U.S. population aged 65 and over grew nearly five times faster than the total population from 1920 to 2020 (2020 Census).  This would affect my community because it would cause work shortages and lead to a growing demand for consumer goods, resulting in fewer exports, which would be even more detrimental to the economy. \n\nFun Title: Live a Longer Life: An Economical Disaster",

South America is mostly younger, Europe is mostly working, and so on. 2023 is similar as well even if the age has increased. Additionally, I see how the older population has gotten more prevalent throughout the world as time has gone on and could keep going all the way to 2050. For example, the US could change from turquoise to green by 2050, so who knows by 2070 where it could go. \n2. What I wonder is if they were trying to target a specific country or continent and show the drastic change. There is a large portion of working age in China right now and it could vastly change to older populations and I wonder how that could effect the world in years to come. I also wonder why Africa was the main area that could possibly not change very much over the course of 60 years and most other continents completely changed. \n3. What I think is going on in this graph is the shift of population growth throughout the different countries and because of increased birth rates and migration the economic growth can be effected. More people means that more people are going to be needed to fill jobs and other services. \n4. This relates to my community because the area I live in has a very large population and there are many apartments and such, so I am curious how that could change over maybe 10 to 20 years. \n\nCatchy Phrase: Growing, Growing, and MORE Growing",

The circle clusters also increase, suggesting a population increase. Africa appears to have the greatest increase in population, interestingly maintaining a \"younger population\" across all three years.\n\nI wonder why the older population is increasing in Europe and the US in particular. I realize that the Baby Boom generation created a comparative increase in the now \"working age/older population,\" which would likely explain the data. China is still evidently being affected by the One Child Policy, as people had fewer children so the older population is projected to increase. I wonder if the increase in an older population will affect countries' economy.\n\nThe graph depicts the aging demographics of the world. Countries with large economies, such as the US, Europe and China, experience the most dramatic increase in older populations in 2050.\n\nThis relates to my community because I, and everyone else considered a young adult, will later have to take care of the large population of senior citizens in the states. There will have to be government reforms in relation to retirement so that no one is left behind.\n\nHeadline: \"Time Are A-Changin': Young Folks Move Aside!\"",

The size of these dots represents the size of the population in that region. I noticed that the population in the U.S. in 1990 was predominantly those of the working age. Currently, in 2023, the majority of the U.S. population is between the younger population age bracket and the working age bracket. I infer this means most of our population is in their mid to late twenties. It is predicted that in 2050 the U.S. population will be predominantly the age bracket between working age and older populations. I infer this means that the majority of our population will be in their 40s. This is not a typical age where people retire so it should not pose a large threat to the economy. I infer or population will become older because fewer and fewer people are having children. Some people are participating in a Birth Strike in hopes of improving global warming. I notice that overall populations are increasing over time. I wonder if this will change as global warming gets worse, and potentially more people will opt to not have children. I notice that China's population is predicted to be predominantly older in 2050. I wonder if this is because of the One Child Policy, as this ended not too long ago in 2016. \nPopulation Predictions and Problems",

Also, in the graph, overtime, the developed countries begin to possess more of the world\u2019s elderly population. In the graph, I noticed that the age distribution in the world\u2019s population remains unchanged for Africa and in some parts of Asia up until 2050. I also saw that in most cases, countries that had a higher youth population in 1990, often led into a higher older population in 2050. This trend is demonstrated in China, the U.S., and parts of Europe. I wonder how the age distribution information was obtained and how the future graph (based in 2050) was predicted. What type of research went on behind this? Also, I wonder if the baby boom in the mid-to-late 1900s in the U.S. and Europe contributed to their trends\u2026 along with the lower birth rates with the decrease of fertility rates in the world. In general, this graph relates to me because it shows how the number of elderly people in the U.S. will be at a high, therefore there will be a greater necessity for senior care centers.

In the map of 1990, the majority of the population across the world were younger ages because all of the dots are dark blue and teal colored on all the countries, representing younger populations and working populations. In 2023, some of the countries\u2019 population ages remained the same such as in Nigeria and China, but a lot of the countries\u2019 populations shifted towards older ages such as in India, Japan, and France because the colors of the dots turned lighter, signifying a shift towards older populations. Finally, the predicted populations in 2050 demonstrate a much older population across the world, particularly in China and France because their dots are fully yellow. I noticed that the general trend in population is that as years pass, the population of elderly people increases. I wonder what the cause of this is and predict that it might be because there are more advancements in medicine and technology that allow elderly people to live longer. I also wonder why some countries\u2019 populations advance to older populations while others stay in the younger or working age populations and if less working age populations will leave an absence of employees in jobs across the globe.

In the earlier years, the countries were more populated with younger and working-age citizens, but in later years, the countries see a majority of older populations. I believe this is because due to medical advancements and improved quality of life, people are living longer on average.

I noticed this becasue in the graphs they have the biggest green circle in both. I wonder what it will mean if the future graph is right in it's perdictions that in 2050 China will not longer have the biggest working class. Lots of what we buy on a daily was made in china, so what will it mean for the US economy if there is no longer large working class in China? This would most likely effect alot of people as we get older, we might notice that buying certain things might not be as easy as it is now. Most of the reason that things are so easy to buy right now is that they are being supplied quickly and mass made, and alot of this is coming from China. What is interesting is that Indian is continuing to still have a younger/working age population even in 2050 which might mean that they will take over China's role in the economy in the future.

As shown on the graph, a large portion of the population is working age now, so their numbers will continue to dominate as they age. Another contributor to their domination of world populations is the rapidly decreasing family size, spearheaded by the current young adults. It is no longer desirable or feasible to have more than a couple of children, so the generations to follow will be considerably smaller. I wonder how this will affect the economy because it will become reliant on an excess of workers, so when the population of workers begins to decline, the workforce will be left wanting. I can see the generation size differences in my own life and in my family. Where my grandparents had multiple siblings, I only have one. The high school in my town is overpopulated, yet there is an excess number of preschools. The change in populations and the growth of the current young adults will lead the world into a new culture of dominant elderly voices, and a small youth to answer back.

The graph's most interesting is how many countries fall into the younger population (15 and under). While countries such as India and France are seen to be changing in average age range, that is the majority of their society increasing in age, countries in Africa and the Middle East, such as Nigeria, continuously stay in younger population range. With a younger population constantly being the majority, what is more prevalent, is short life spans or mothers constantly giving birth? As for China,  the older age range (65 and above) will dominate by 2050. This is a direct result of their 1 child rule in families. This multi-children ban was an attempt to combat the issue of overpopulation. However, it was proven to not only be worrisome in communities, as people were killing and or abandoning their kids, but leading directly to the problem depicted on the graph. With an older population taking over, how will this affect the economy? Who will take over the jobs that 65-year-olds are unable to do? If this starts affecting China in a negative way, when will it start to affect the world as a whole? As for my own community, the only issue I feel that will affect it is the issue of China.

The 2050 map displays a separate projection, believing that the global population will further increase.

The chart shows that the 1990 map has no older population points, but the 2023 map has older population points, and the 2050 map has a lot of older population points. This is probably due to medical advances that are helping people live longer.  \n I wonder if we will reach the point where the older population outnumbers the younger. In theory, it should stay the same because people are born and die every day, so it should stay relatively constant. That's why I wonder if the future will be the same as now or completely different.  \n In a few years, my generation will be part of the working generation, and new people will join this \"young generation\". \n \n This graph shows the evolution of the eras in different parts of the world in different years.

India's population seems to be younger, either under the working age or of the working age. In 2050 it seems China's population will mostly be older, which i'm assuming will be due to less children being born to bring down the national average.\n2. I wonder what the meaning of this graph really is? It could be interpreted as many things, but from what I interpreted so far is that the rest of the world will grow in population maintaining a population that is around the working age whilst China has less and less children making it so their national average has a much more older population by 2050.\n3. In all three graphs the US seems to have a somewhat normal progression compared to China. We seem to grow in population little by little but we also don't drastically have a change in our population age average. The only change I observed that was somewhat big was during 2050 where it seems we will have a population that is above the working age but also doesn't fall under the \"older population\".\n4. I think it just shows projections of the population around the world. \"Are we getting old or is everyone just getting younger? Lets see what these graphs have to say about the projected population age!\"",

I wonder how this will affect the US economy in the next 30 years if our population will no longer be in the \"working age.\" I think the graph shows what countries have a younger population and how their economy could reflect that.

The evidence to support this is shown in the graph from 1990, where it shows Africa as a country with younger populations and not many people spread apart in Africa, essentially low on numbers. But when the time 2050 comes the graph predicts/shows us that almost the entirety of the continent is covered with population circles. Mostly being younger population.\n2.I wonder what data was collected to make the prediction that almost the whole continent of Africa is covered with younger populations. I also wonder why other parts of the world have not drastically increased the same way Africa has, and why Africa has remained a young country even after many years.\n3.This relates to me and my community because the growing population and Africa can most likely lead to immigration to the U.S. This isn't necessarily a problem for me and my community but it can perhaps increase the number of properties being bought, or rented around my area.\n4. What's going on in this graph?\nAfrica in 2050- A continent overtaken by a young population!",

The graph also shows that in future updates they will now be having a bigger impact with older populations, as we can tell that the past years shown in the graph are having the smallest amount of older populations, or as in 1990 no amount of older populations. The Nigeria area continues to stay the same and Brazil is now having an in between of working age and older population. \nI wonder if they \u00e1reas that are now being taken over by the older population will continue to be the older population and then soon enough it be slowly falling apart, as they can lose their economic growth. \nThis relates to my community and I because if they countries less developed fall apart; then it will cause them to try and increase other necessities that will cost more for people.

I wonder why not all countries follow the same pattern as Europe (middle-aged to older adult to elderly) and how living situations/cultural beliefs impact this pattern.\n\n3.

In 2023, they have less of a younger population and more of an older population. This time though, India and China are the countries with the most working-age populations. Now in 2050, it is obvious that there are more colors referring to the younger populations, working age, and older populations. These categories seem to be more spread out than in 1990 and 2023. China seems to have changed into a country with the most older population and India seems to be the same. The U.S. seems to be in the middle of working age and older populations just like Brazil. I wonder what China and Japan have done to be able to support older people. I also wonder if India has a more working-age population than China since they had a one-child policy and India had the chance to catch up. This relates to me and my community because through 1990 and 2050 there has been a high population between young people and working age due to the higher chance to succeed. There are more job opportunities in the U.S. therefore, many migrate to the U.S. for the opportunities and start a family here so their children can get the opportunities offered as well. These opportunities include education and jobs. Heading: The Differences of the Evolution of a Population",

For example, China from 1990 to 2023, kept its average working age to increase through that interval of time. As well as with India, in 1990, it started with a young population, but after 33 years, it started to increase to fit in the working age.  Also, by looking at the graph, we see that the prediction in 2050, each continent, except Africa, is expected to experience a significant rise in population age according to this graph. \n2) What do you wonder?\nI wonder why throughout time; Africa had the largest increase in population throughout the period of 1990 to 2023. Are there any factors that cause their population to increase more than any other country?\n3) How does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to me and my community in a way that through time, as the population grows, the production of resources that are traded around the world would increase as we have more people to both work in the production, but as well as we have more consumers.

The color of the dots relates to the key that signifies which color represents which age group. The map from 1990 shows a smaller population in each country compared to the maps of 2023 and 2050. All of the populations in each country have the majority as working age or younger. However, in the map of 2023, the majority of each country\u2019s population gets older. The majority of the population in France begins to approach the older population and China\u2019s majority reaches the older population. In addition, the overall population of the world is increasing. In the 2050 map, most of the world's population is the working age or older. However, in Africa, the population is still mostly young population. The population of the planet as a whole also increases a lot. I can conclude from this that the African population stays young because they are a third-world country. Therefore, their technology isn\u2019t as good and their health deteriorates quickly as they get older. This means more deaths. On the other hand, the older population in China is a result of the one-child rule.

    "comment info": "1. What do you notice? If your notice makes a claim, where in the graph is the evidence to support it?\n\nI notice that the more expensive places to live generally house the older population or working population. For example, most products that are sold throughout the US are designed and manufactured in China, hence most of the working class takes up the Chinese population. It is also very expensive to live throughout Asia because in most areas they are trying to eliminate carbon waste by stopping people from using a car as their method of transportation (Singapore). \n\n2. What do you wonder?\n\nI wonder why most of the graph is taken up by the younger community in the 90s, but they have predicted that in 2050 there will be a dramatic difference. I also wonder how they differentiate the working class from the younger community since I know that most people my age are considered to be really young but most of us have jobs. \n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\n\nWe may have to reconsider opening up more government housing and figuring out a solution globally. The fact that in the 2023 most of the US is in the younger/working class, and in just 20ish years we are predicted to be apart of the older generation, is slightly concerning. \n\n4.

Developed nations, such as the U.S., Europe, and East Asia, have increasingly aging populations from 1990 to 2050, as indicated by the colors transitioning from green to orange on the graph. In contrast, regions like Africa and parts of Latin America maintain predominantly younger populations, reflected in the consistent blue coloring. This transformation might be attributed to the ongoing development and modernization of these countries.\n\nI wonder what is causing the population to get older? Is it due to declining birth rates? Increased life expectancy? Lower immigration? Urbanization?\n\nThis affects my community as an aging population can strain healthcare, affect the labor force, and stress pension systems in your community. It may require adjustments in housing, social services, and urban planning. Encouraging intergenerational interactions and seizing economic opportunities are crucial for a well-balanced and thriving community.\n\nCatchy headlines: From Cradle to Canes: The Global Agequake Chronicles\n\nThe Silver Storm: Unmasking the Ageing Phenomenon\n\nYouth Fades, Wisdom Stays: A World in Transition\n\nChronicles of Aging Nations: The Quiet Revolution\n\nFrom Baby Boom to Silver Surge: Global Agequake Ahead\n\nThe Graying Globe: A Demographic Tug-of-War",

While developed countries are becoming much older, less developed countries continue to have a high proportion of younger populations. In the graph, it shows that throughout 1990-2050, the U.S., Europe, and  East Asia had older populations (colors ranged from green to orange) while Africa and some parts of Latin America had younger populations (color was predominantly blue).\n2) I wonder what the correlation is between economic growth and the world's age distribution. Does greater economic growth mean lower birth rates? Wouldn't it make more sense for developed countries to have more kids since they have the financial ability to take care of them? Or does having an aging population much more detrimental than it seems?\n3) This relates to me and my community because we live in the U.S., a developed nation with a rapidly growing old population. Already there are many problems with the large population of old people. The most prominent problem is a decline in the working age population. Less people working leads to shortages of workers. If the trend continues, this might severely impact the economy.\n4) Age Is Just A Number, Or Is There More To It?",

Lastly the African population seems to not only have grown tremendously but it bears the most youthful population out of all the continents.\n\nWhat do I wonder?

And why other continents display relatively stable growth and Africa much more significant growth.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community? Looking at South Africa, there does not seem to be any change of note so with regards to my immediate community it's hard to say, however looking at at all corners of the continent except the south , it would be possible for more people to have migrated to Africa due to the cheaper cost of living. And this assumption would make sense as a more elderly population would likely have more or earn more money than their youthful counterparts and thus could sustain their livelihood in Europe and Asia.\n\nCatchy headline?
