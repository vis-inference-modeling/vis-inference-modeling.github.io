Although it is not telling us to go to certain places, it shows us places we should visit less. Most, if not all, of the places that have a high level of contact, is non-essential. Because of the pandemic, many of the services have converted to online or non-contact services. Of course, some services we may not be able to replace with technology, like beauty salons and nail salons, but asthe majority of us are staying at home, there is no need to get these services at a time like this.

Gyms and nail salons require more contact with others, compared to malls and restaurants. Governors are taking into mind the risk of spreading the virus to decide which places are the safest to open up first. Based on the graph, the safest places to open first would be outdoor places with greater contact because if you\u2019re outside, such as at the park or the beach, there\u2019s less interacting with people and touching other surfaces, and you\u2019re able to spread out more, depending on the amount of people. In fact, outdoor areas have already opened in most places. With ranking fast food restaurants, gyms, and sit-down restaurants on which should open first, I think fast food should open first. They are open now, but only offer takeout or mobile orders, which is a smart take. Secondly, should be sit-down restaurants because you are required to eat at the restaurant and sit at tables where others have sat, you have to interact with workers when ordering, and they reuse cutlery. Gyms should open last because you're required to share the equipment, and social distancing can be difficult as well as cleaning the facility and machines each time. I believe it's best to wait to open smaller businesses and crowded places like amusement parks, and wait until the virus starts to clear up more.",

I believe it is very important that when governments make this type of decisions, they take into account the things explained in this graph. They should know about the sectors involving indoor activities and the level of contact they have. With this, they can finally start opening the businesses and public spaces so that we can start recovering from the economic crisis and start increasing the percentage of employed people. The global economy is expected to decrease 3% in 2020, that being the steepest slowdown after the Great Depression.

When looking at the graph, it is pretty obvious that indoor activities normally involve high levels of contact between people and surfaces.  I also noticed that the much bigger masses or \"bubbles\" consist of much more contact, as they are all activities that occur indoors. This directly can affect the spread of the virus, even with fast food where as some people would consider drive thru fast food is non-contact, the food is touched by many many workers and has passed by so many surfaces. This is where we have to be careful with what shops we choose to stay open, and what circumstances they must operate under. \n\nAfter reading the reveal and other students' replies, I realized that this graph was actually used in an article earlier this month in which NYT asked people where they thought the safest places were to go and interact. Now that I know this information, I think that public stores and small businesses and places with the least amount of contact should be opened first. I also think that the amount of time people spend in different stores and places should also be a vital factor when deciding  how soon they open to the public. It\u2019s also crucial that we don't open many stores at once, it's very important to start gradually and responsibly.",

These are indoors place but even going to the park can be dangerous if you don't stay away from others. As I see the bubble chart many places amuse me as I thing fast-food chains if treated as a drive-thru place the level of contagion can lowered quite a lot or amusement parks that have the same level of contact as sit down restaurants but a lower risk.

According to the Stat Nuggets, in the reopening graph, the diameter of the bubble is representative of the size of the business sector or public place as calculated by the product of the average weekly visits and the total number of establishments. The other two variables are the rating of the degree of contact, as measured by the interaction with people and touched shared surfaces, defined by the horizontal x-axis, and the rating of how much of the activity is indoors (versus outside) is located on the vertical y-axis. \nThe association was inconclusive due to the lack of information and experimentation, and there isn't any percent change due to the lack of a big difference in data.",

Now after reading the reveal, I see that this graph was used in an opinion article earlier this month which asked people where they thought the safest places were to go. One of the critical questions under the reveal asked whether outdoor places with greater contact or indoor places with less contact were safer, and to answer that I would say that the outdoor places would be safer because it is less likely that you will have to touch the same surfaces as others due to more space. Places like parks and beaches would be safer to open first, which they are opening back up right now in the world, while most restaurants and businesses are still not completely reopened but are sticking to delivery or pick up orders. I think that was the smartest way to go about this situation, since there will be less shared surfaces that people touch outside.",

Besides, the only major contact of transmission for gas stations is the hands (when you are getting gas) in which getting germs on the surface is pretty low to get you sick (that is, if you don't wear gloves or wash your hands afterwards).",

On one hand, opening low risk stores sounds like a great idea, but it\u2019s also showing favoritism and not allowing other stores to have business. And even if the governor of a state starts opening low risk stores, what qualifies as a low risk store anyway? In the article, it says that the governor of California is trying to open bookstores, toy stores, and sporting goods, but those all fit into the high risk category. And it gets even harder when adding in the aspect of concentration in businesses. A breakfast restaurant will have all it\u2019s customers come in in the morning, while a breakfast, lunch, and diner restaurant will have customers coming in throughout the whole day. If it\u2019s already difficult to categorize the risk of going to attractions, I can\u2019t imagine how hard it\u2019s going to be to categorize the risk of types of specific buildings like restaurants.",

However, actually understanding which ones were high threat based on their placement and size took me longer. By thinking longer about it, I came to the conclusion that the size of the bubble had to due with the population that would go to these places. However, I still questioned why things like amusement parks were so low, and sit in restruants were so high. The other two things going on in the graph were easy to comprehend. On the x-axis, it shows the level of contact within the place, which pretty much just calculates the level of interaction between people and objects in that place. Then the on the y axis, it showed the activity indoors.\n\nAfter looking at this, I can understand the usefulness of a graph like this in times like these. It can help show people where they should't be going and make them see that going places should be a necessity. If I were to re-title it, it'd be, \"what you need to know about the places you go\".",

Strangely though, even though sit-down restaurants and malls closed down relatively early, the North Carolina state government left the fast food restaurants open. I\u2019m glad they did though, it\u2019s hard finding food places when all the restaurants are closed. I also remember that gyms, amusement parks, and nail salons were all closed very early on in the pandemic. Though they all lie on different places on the indoors to outdoors scale, I can see that they\u2019re all past level 6 of contact. This is very different from parks and museums which didn\u2019t close as early on. It wasn\u2019t until bored people started flocking to the parks that they closed down. I don\u2019t think that should have happened because parks are so low on the contact scale and are also situated outside. This means that any virus germs that a person could have wouldn\u2019t be passed along as easily as germs in an indoor location would. The same thing happened with the beaches even though they\u2019re not on this graph. \n\nIn order for the state government to start opening things safely, I suggest going from the bottom left corner and ending in the top right corner. Opening buildings that contain activities that are outdoors and alone to those that are indoors and interconnected is the best course of action. Although I do hope that restaurants start opening up again soon. Fingers crossed.",

    "comment info": "While looking at this graph the first thing that you notice is the eye catching cluster of green circles at the top of the graph, which feature the places that have become a red light during this pandemic. Although I found that I was shocked at how low amusement parks were. They had about the same level of contact as malls and sit-down restaurants (about 6), but salons, gyms, and clubs had way more. This made me curious because I would've thought that amusement parks would be higher in the level of contact because almost every amusement park can be found bustling with people and your always waiting in long , crowded lines for rides. It also hit me that because parks are at a constant 'go,go,go' they don't really get to keep rides clean throughout the day. Where as salons and clubs clean some surfaces throughout the day. At parks your in close proximity with strangers and touching objects that hundreds of people have touched. Something else that shocked me about the salons was that, in Hawai'i, I heard on the news that salons and other places could be opening soon, but if there is such a high rate of contact that people have, that's even higher than restaurants, malls, and stores, I would think about that they wouldn't open it up.  I also find that in a time where our economy is so uncertain people wouldn't spend money on nails and hair. With that I think a good title for this graph is \"Do We Know Where True Contact Lies?\"",

While germs are spread more easily inside these locations, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll cause a huge surge in new cases. People are still weary about going inside indoor buildings, so it might take a few weeks for people to even start feeling comfortable going back to restaurants and malls. I definitely have seen a lot of people in outdoor locations like parks and beaches though! \n\nTo answer your question, I think that air travel would belong in the top right corner close to beauty salons and nail salons since people are trapped in an airplane for hours on end together. There\u2019s a much higher risk of catching COVID-19 on an 18 hour long flight than a one hour meal inside a restaurant. And yes, I think that the amount of contact at places depends on the weather and season. No one\u2019s going to want to go to the park or beach in 20 degree weather just like no one\u2019s going to want to miss going outside on a sunny day. I also love your title.

All of these bubbles seem to be in the right spots from most contact to least contact. I just can't tell what Activity Indoors really means yet. So far all I've been thinking about are places you can be inside for an extended amount of time. I'm guessing the bigger the bubbles the more popular it is. Like for example Malls, people go there a lot for shopping and meeting friends. The Mall bubble is bigger than a gas station because people only go there for gas, not for like fun activities. \n\nThis graph could be a prediction for phase two and how popular and crowded it will get. All of these places could be what's opening for phase two. I don't know much about it but I know restaurants, barbershops, and other small businesses are going to open back up on Friday I believe. I think it could be a prediction because smaller businesses are on this graph and it does have an x-axis for the level of contact. This makes me believe that some of the more contact areas on the graph will probably have some restrictions. I also think that the fewer contact areas have more of a chance to open back up with fewer restrictions then the more contact areas. You know like vice versa.",

At the beginning of this year, there might have been a lot of people going to Amusement parks or Museums, therefore increasing the chances of social interaction. Lately, however, people have been rarely leaving their homes other than for necessities. \n\nAll in all, it's the places that have the potential for the most social interactions that will be closed the longest. And while it might have to do with the fact that they're indoor business or other circumstances, I hope that they are taking the necessary precautions so as to not put people at risk. \n\nHeadline: Bigger Businesses Should Be Taking Bigger Precautions",

If you make a claim, tell us what you noticed that supports your claim.\n\nI notice that in the graph, the biggest circles are Sit-Down restaurants, Fast Food Restaurants and Malls. This is probably because the first two provide an opportunity for people to get food and to eat without having to make something themselves. Malls provide a chance for people to get outside of the house and do something fun like shopping.\n\n\nWhat do you wonder? What are you curious about that comes from what you notice in the graph?\n\nI wonder if the places in the graph are accurate enough for everywhere else? Where was this taken? I also wonder when they recorded the data? I wonder why they open up the bigger businesses first instead of opening the small ones first since this increases the amount of people going out and the chance of them getting the virus increases.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?

I also wonder why the specific industries that were looked at were taken into considerations over others that are arguably more pressing and more needed to be reopened. I also wonder why someone would consider an amusement park so low on the contact scale when there is often very little cleaning and masses of people coming in in places like that. That rating alone leads me to question the validity of the entire graph as a real statistic on the interaction and enclosure of these. Lastly, I wonder if when given the scale of 1-10 to vote on if there were any guides like if at going to a tick mark three place you would feel the need to wash your hands or anything like that so in short what the scale is.\n\nI predict...\nI predict that as times wear on people will begin to feel differently, and I think in a year when we have been living more cautiously for a while people will begin to see that many of the things put as highly interactive can be done in safer, less contaminating ways. In just two months there has been a lot of innovation in how to run things while social distancing and I think people overestimate the amount of contact and danger of certain things when they can fairly easily be done with minimal contact.\n\n\nCatchy Headline: The Public's Take On What Is The Most Dangerous Activity Right Now",

Although the risk of spreading and getting the infection is still high our country needs to slowly reopen small businesses so people have a source of income, this process is taking very slow and I think this is because no one knows to react safely and surely I personally think that strict restrictions and enforcements such as (masks, gloves etc.) should be required within any business planning to reopen to limit the spread of disease.",

That confuses me and makes me upset. Places like nail salons with so much contact is so dangerous. I think it's extremely selfish that nails are being painted and people are out dying. \nI wonder why restaurants are still open. I think it's crazy that sit-down restaurants are still open. Where I live, they're still closed. I feel like that is where you could pick up the virus the most.",

I wonder if the places represented in the graph are accurate enough to assume it is for everywhere? I do not truly know is he details apply to all places, or if it is just a broad spectrum of details to apply in general. The bubbles in the graph represent the highest areas of contact being made, hence the x-axis being the level of contact being 0 with no contact to 8 being the most amount of contact. The y-axis represents the activity outdoors, at which they are most populated. Each big bubble consists of smaller bubbles that represent the colaged areas of highest to the largest amount of contact being made. Catchy Headline: Don't go into the big bubbles, PLEASE!",
