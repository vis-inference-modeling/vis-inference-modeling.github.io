On the other hand, American's stereotype certain races, Asians for example, based on their intelligence.

I was surprised to see that only around 25% of young people in the United States thought education was the most important factor to success. I wonder if this has anything to do with the location from which this survey was conducted or what results we may have seen from a different part of the U.S. This directly relates to me because of my age and being able to see what my generation believes is the key to success. If I were asked this question I would have a hard time answering the question because it really depends on the situation someone is in, but overall I think education is the most important factor towards success.",

Peru seems to extremely consider education as a priority while Indonesia and Japan both seem to consider hard work as a priority. I also noticed that the U.S. considers education slightly less than hard work and wealth/connections. This makes me wonder, despite all the high quality and given the various education opportunities through top universities and colleges the U.S. is known for, why would young people consider it less? Would this decision differ depending on international students and U.S. students? Overall I noticed that education and hard work are the top 2 main factors young people consider for success. \nI wonder if this result has been like this continuously in past years or suddenly changed into this result recently. Would pre-pandemic, during, or after (possibly) differ the results hugely or little? I also wonder what made the people decide certain factors are more important than others for success, especially since the data is from young people, considering some people might still be in school, college, etc.\nI think this information relates to my community and even to myself personally considering the ages mentioned and the results from the U.S. which I feel connected to as well.",

I wonder why a country like japan who values education so much has such a low percentage of people who think education brings success.

To me, that was surprising because in my area of the US, education is considered the most important factor when it comes to achieving success. Large amounts of pressure is put on students for them to succeed academically. Additionally, it makes sense that Americans value hard work when it comes to success, because that is what the American dream is centered around. On the flip side, I also noticed that third world countries, such as Indonesia generally do not believe that family, wealth, or connections play a big part of success. \n\nI wonder how many 15-24 year olds responded to the question. I also wonder how many of them were of each age within that, because people who are 24 will most likely have a significantly different outlook compared to people who are 15 or 16. I also wonder why many countries in Africa and Asia place more value on hard work compared to countries in North America and Europe. Does it have to do with the economy, or just pure strength and determination? The last and probably most important question is, how do these individuals define success?\n\nThis graph affects me and my community because I am in the age group that was surveyed for this graph.

Example: Japan's hard-working ethics has made them do miracles such as developing futuristic infrastructure, but they have a rampant problem with overworking themselves to death and high suicide. So we should adopt the Japanese work ethic but enough to kill ourselves.

    "comment info": "1. I notice that the different countries' values shift based on how they are structured such as their economies (capitalistic for example). Another factor that affects the results is the age range that they interviewed, younger people might focus more on education and its effects since they were in schooling more recently. Another way that being younger can affect the results is in the connections category, older generations had stronger connections and different values (more family-based) while younger generations have focused more on working for where they are. \n\n2. I wonder what are the different educations systems are like such as when the students start and end the education on average, what do the different countries consider \"hard work\", and why did the interviewers choose the countries that they did ( is it based on the different average incomes or some other factor?)?\n\n3. I think that younger people will compare their values and the values of other countries and consider changing systems in place around them to fit the countries that excel the best to them. For example, if someone in the U.S sees that Peru focuses more on education than them and have a higher rate of people going on to have successful careers the person in the U.S might set up systems for those around them and future generations to have better education systems so that the community could improve and more people could succeed.\n\n4.

For family wealth or connections, Bangladesh had the lowest percentage and U.S. has the highest percentage.

I wonder in what ways is wealth and poverty of countries affecting young people's choices in determining what the most important factors for success are.\n\n3. This relates to me and my community because I think hard work is the most important while my community thinks education is the most important.\n\n4. This graph is showing 4 different factors and how percentages of young people from different countries change for what they think is the most important.

According to the graph, the US determines wealth mostly on family wealth or connections and hard work. This is unexpected, especially because the American education system puts so much pressure on young people to do well in school. Without a good education in America, it's difficult to get a good job and become successful. This is a known fact.

I agree. I think that education is thought of highly here but is not the most important. I believe this idea of education is slowly going away, so I see how it is a little less that 50%. When I think of America I think of perseverance to get to the \"American Dream\", with this I think of hard work.
