When asked if the world is getting better with each generation, youth ages 15-24 seemed more optimistic than the 40+ especially within \u2018first world' countries such as the US, UK, Japan and Germany. Only 3 of 20 countries have older generations who believe the world is improving which leads me to wonder if countries not mentioned believe it\u2019s not improving at all. I wonder if people between ages 15-24 will have a different mindset as time goes on since the world keeps changing and what factors contribute to the populace\u2019s perception on whether the world is becoming a better place. This relates to me and my community since I\u2019m part of the youth and am surrounded by my age group at school but also have older cultured parents and family so I can see the different mindsets first hand between the youth and the older generation. I have noticed that older generations seem to make generalizations about the younger generations and that there is a common agreement among each side with many people between ages 15-24 finding themselves in line with each other about feeling the world being a better place as we progressively move forward with each generation.

I think they do because this world today is typically more accepting than it was then. They might also be living an easier and better life than their parents and they are challenging authorities more etc and fighting change. I think older people might think the world is becoming worse because they don't like how the younger generation is handling the world today and they might be more traditional, or it just could be that's how they generally feel. It is understandable to say the world is getting worse because today we have more opportunities to make a difference. Back then things were cruel and there were harder situations to avoid.

Due to percentages being counted it's clear that there is not even a low percentage of older people that have faith in where this world is going.",

The US is one of the farthest points away from the line, with a positive residual, meaning that more young people think the world is getting better, and less older people do. I wonder if what the world was like as the older people were growing up shaped how they feel about future generations - they might be negative because newer ideas and concepts that they are not used to are surfacing, and many people do not like change.\nI wonder what other countries' data looks like - is there a specific reason that they chose to only survey/include these countries?

Two countries that I immediately notice have large differences between the opinions of the younger and older groups surveyed are the United States and Japan. For the United States, almost 65% of the younger generation believes the world is getting better with each generation while about 35% of the 40+ group believes this. For Japan, about 60% of the 15-24-year-old group believes the world is getting better with each generation while about 25% of the older group believes the prompt.

There were no significant outliers that had the opposite relationship. I also noticed that the differential between the two was greatest in countries that had relatively low population growth rates, like the United States and Japan. I learned in my human geography class that relationships like that can end out exacerbating issues for the older dependent population. I wonder if potentially that is one of the reasons why older people tend to have a more pessimistic viewpoint on where society is headed. I also wonder why some countries, like Indonesia, were so overwhelmingly positive in their views across the board, but some countries were overall very negative. I think it likely is influenced by the situation of internal affairs within that country.

After stating the first impressions of the data collected in the graph my primary observation is that the overall mean percentage of the 15- to 24-year-olds who say that the world is getting better with each generation is higher than 50% whereas the mean percentage of the 40+ year-olds who say that the world is getting better is lower than 50%. The analysis of this data can bring to the spotlight the fact that older generations may have already felt that their contribution towards a more developed and \"brighter\" future wasn't enough or that more recent generations would not be able to receive better life conditions when comparing themselves with the newer generations. This type of feeling could increase depression rates and a more rather negative outlook towards humanities's future. On the other hand, the data expresses and illustrates how the younger generations are more optimistic about the world's situation heading to future generations as well. Younger perspectives when discussing the future can surely extract more hope and greater future aspirations to bring to the world in order to expand aspect in which the human race can improve upon. Indonesia is a clear example of this, as it is the most optimistic country with both age ranges assuming that the world is getting better with each generation.

    "comment info": "The graph showing plots of multiple countries and their older and younger population answering one question is the world getter better with each generation. I immediately noticed that the younger generations are a lot more optimistic than the older generation. The US for example has more than 50 percent of their 15-24 year olds believing that the world is getting better with each generation while less than 50 percent of the 40  year old believe the same thing. I am wondering based on this data could the political swing of one generation also be affecting their ideas about the future. In addition, could there be a discrepancy in what the older versus what younger populations believe is better for the world. This data is important and affects both my community and I due to the fact that the optimism in a community is really important when trying to advocate for anything. The large gap presented in the graph indicates that there are major differences between what the older and younger generations believe is better for the world. That is going to cause some tensions in a community such as mine if the discussion of differences is not addressed properly. A name I would give to this graph would be: Are the Kids Ruining Everything?",

Countries like the United States and Japan have a large amount of disagreement across these generations. The location of each country does not seem to matter too much to the overall data, but there do seem to be clusters of European countries (Argentina, Spain, France, U.K.)  and African countries (Zimbabwe, Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria).\n\nI wonder if the data would be different if the \"older\" generation (40+) was split into two or three sections.  What about people younger than 15 and people from 25 to 39 years old? Are we missing important information? I wonder how this data would contrast with a graph of how each country is doing economically. I wonder how it would contrast with a graph of which countries have different politics and ways of controlling society. How would it be different compared to news coverage and access to resources? This data is probably heavily influenced by the bias of each generation for themselves. I wonder if this data will increase or decrease in the future or if biases are the only factor.\n\nThis relates to me because I am in the younger generation and I hope that the world is getting better.\n\nAn article title could be: A Generational Divide: Are we really getting better?",

I notice that there doesn't seem to be too much correlation between which countries are more positive or negative towards the future. It seems there are some countries from around the world, but this graph does not include many others like China or Korea, or Norway just to name a few.\n\nI wonder if the older generation is generally less positive towards the future because they have lived longer and seen what the past was like and the present and future as less good. For example, a 50-year-old who has probably lived their childhood and adolescence without phones and computers and the internet might be more opposed to it than a 15-year-old who has probably lived most of their life with phones and the internet. I also wonder if older generations are generally more pessimistic or if they are just pessimistic towards the future of the world. In addition, I wonder what would this graph look like if it were taken 20 years ago, or 50, or 100? \n\nThis relates to me and my community because I have noticed that my friends who fall in the 15- to 24-year-olds category do seem to be more open to change and more readily positive towards the future.

Especially in countries like the US, there is a huge difference, with about 70% of young people believing the world is getting better and only about 30% of the elderly believe it\u2019s getting better. However there are some countries like Indonesia, India, and Nigeria who have relatively even numbers of people, young and old, who think that the world is getting better. I wonder why higher percentages of people in less developed countries say the world is getting better. Does it have anything to do with the fact that they see their own lack of development and then they see how the world around them has many improvements, and perceive improvements from around the world as much greater things than people from more developed countries might perceive them? This graph poses many questions about perspective, especially with the topic of improvement being very perspective based.

The variables are the responses of the younger people and the responses of the older people. It shows a moderate correlation between young people and more positive responses towards the world's growing conditions. \nI feel that the audience intended for this graph are sociocultural and brain development professionals. From a psychological standpoint, this audience may be able to use this information to see the differences that different cultures' cognitive processes, regarding optimism, differ with age.\nI think the purpose is to show the difference in cognition between different societies and ages. As younger people seem to have a more positive mindset, there may be a developmental stage during 15-24 years old that could impact your mindset. In addition, differences in culture can play a role in the differences in mental development.",

As in the graph, you can see that most of the 15 - 24-year-olds in the provided countries fall between the 50-75% range, with none under 25%. However, when looking at the Y-axis for people over the age of 40, most countries fall below 50%, and have a significant amount under 25%. \n\nThere is not exactly a noticeable trend among the data, however you do notice that most of the '1st world' countries have a much higher 'optimistic' younger population than an older one. As you can see in the graph, the US, UK, Japan and Germany are all within the 50-75% range on the X-axis (younger people believing the world is getting better), meanwhile on the Y-axis (Older people believing that the world is getting better) all the previously mentioned countries fall below the 50% mark. \n\nThere is an anomaly within this result, which would be Indonesia, as both the younger and older generations agree that the world is getting better as time goes on. This is likely due to the fact that Indonesia's economy has increased by over 600% since the year 2000, this would obviously see a great increase in the quality of life and general welfare of the populace. Under such conditions, it is quite understandable why Indonesia's population generally have such 'high hopes' for the future.",

But except for three countries, young people in other countries will be more optimistic about the development of the world than the elderly. But according to a psychological survey by UC Davis, 51 is the peak of optimism, but it doesn't seem to show this in this chart. This raises my question: is this data reliable enough? What is the specific age of the person who answered this question? But when we assume that the data of this questionnaire is reliable, a very interesting question arises. Can an optimistic attitude towards the development of the world really show that this person is an optimistic person? Because in my opinion, this is a very objective problem. I am in China because the epidemic protection is very strict. In China, entering shopping malls or some public areas requires a QR code to prove that they are healthy, but many middle-aged and elderly people are rejected because they don't have mobile phones or can't use them. This will make them feel abandoned, abandoned by the world. This is just a small example, but when we re-examine this chart, I believe everyone will have the answer.",

As Japan and the U.S. are both developed countries in the world, they were both among  the top 3 highest GDP in 2021, but they don't have a high percentage, which means this data is not based on Economics Stability. You are saying the U.S. younger people are pretty optimistic, that's probably because the American  Education does not value grades, parents pay more attention on children's physical and mental health rather than homework, so the American children don't have that much pressure as Chinese students have. Chinese Education is completely different from the U.S., Chinese parents only care about their children's grade, they think everything you do without learning is just a waste of time and if you don't go into a good college then your life is finished. Relatively speaking, American children have more freedom and less pressure, I think that may be the reason why American younger people are pretty optimistic. But I'm not saying that American Education is bad, it also has its advantages, this is just my prediction.",

I wonder why Indonesia has such a high percentage of people in both the younger generation and older generation that say the world is getting better with each generation.\n3. This relates to me and my community because the majority of people from 15 to 24 in the world think that the world is getting better with each generation and those are the people who are choosing jobs and starting to impact the world.

I also noticed that Indonesia overall has a much higher rating of people saying the world gets better with every generation and this was across the board for ages surveyed. I also observed that the closer each country's dot was to the black line, the more the two age groups agreed with the other. For example, Morocco, Nigeria, and India all show that these two groups have the relative same consensus. I saw that about 21,000 and up people have been interviewed in each country by phone. I wonder if certain areas of these countries have different overall opinions and if they contrast from those in different areas. Also, if the survey was conducted only by telephone it could impact the results of the people being surveyed if many people in a country do not have access to a phone.

Infact, with the exception of India, Nigeria, and Moroco every group of younger people have more faith than their older counterparts.

We noticed Indonesia has the highest number of younger people that think the world is getting better. Based on this graph, there seems to be no correlation between wealth and the perception that the world is getting better. This can be seen by the USA being high and next to poorer countries. Some wealthier countries are higher up on the graph.\n\n2. We wonder why countries with larger populations are not on the graph.\n\n3.

This is interesting because it shows how the younger generation has more optimism for themselves compared to older generations. This could be because of a bias towards themselves for both groups. The younger people have more confidence within their own generation. Whereas the older people believe that they are better at managing the world.\n\nI wonder what specifically gave the people of Indonesia the confidence in their younger generation compared to the rest of the world. With the percentage overall being much higher compared to all other countries, I wonder if there is a specific cause to this statistic.\n\nThis relates to my community because I have noticed that much of the older generation in my community is much more hesitant towards being confident in the younger generation for the future compared to the young people themselves. Whether this be due to the hope of still being young, or another cause. It is something very prevalent in my community.\n\nThis graph shows the comparison of percentage of young adults vs 40+ year olds who believe that the world is becoming better with each generation.

Does this necessarily mean that someone who responded \"No\" thinks that the young are incapable of leading? Or could it mean that they think the older generation made mistakes that foredoomed the world for future generations? Does a \"No\" response necessarily mean someone thinks the young are less capable? Or could it mean other things? What do you think?",

I noticed in the graph that typically the younger generations had more optimism. This is because the majority of the 15-24 year old responses in the graph were above the line that was used to show how similar the younger and older adults' answers were for each country. For example, India's point is very close to the line, which therefore shows that India's adolescents and older adults have a very similar response. Along with this information, I also noticed that the countries with the highest optimism were countries that are still developing and are continuously growing and improving. I wonder why Brazil and Mali are so low on the graph. I also wonder what determines levels of optimism. I want to know why adults are generally less optimistic. Could this be because they have more life experience and have more realistic expectations? This relates to me and my community because I am in high school and I  live in the United States. I would say that the information in the graph accurately reflects my country. A good title for this graph could be: \"Country Optimism Through the Ages\"",

This is a great response, with an amazing articulation of what the line represents and what it means to be far above the line or very close to it. \n\nYou also observed a great pattern of more optimism in developing nations, where there may be a faster rate of economic growth. Along these lines, you wondered why Brazil and Mali had such low general optimism. To find a potential explanation, try exploring this World Bank database of GDP growth (a measure of economic size) for different countries. Set the slider values to 2000 - 2019, so the years are just prior to the pandemic:https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG?end=2015&start=1999Of course, it's best to be cautious.

This graph depicts many more countries such as Brazil, Japan, the US and Zimbabwe showing 15-24 year olds saying the world gets better with each generation. On the opposing side, few countries such as Nigeria, India and Morocco have adults over the age of 40 agreeing the world gets better with each generation. Within theses graphs you can also see the percentage of people that are in agreement. Mali and Brazil, for example, both had a little more than 25% agree the world is getting better. I wonder why these countries are so low and why countries like Ethiopia and Zimbabwe are much more in favor of this question. Being in the 15-24 year old generation I think me and my friends have more faith in the younger generations than my parents generation, who still have more than my grandparents generation.

But even then, only 45-60% of adults in these countries actually believe this. \n\nIndonesia is the only country where over 75% of its population of 15-24 year olds things the world is getting better. The rest of the countries' percentage of believers range from anywhere between 25%-75%. \n\n2. I wonder how human development influenced these results. Around 15-24 years of age, you slowly but surely start to lose your innocence as more terrible aspects of the world become clear. That may be why so few people in that age range actually believe that the world can experience a positive change. The older you get, however, you will witness so many changes since the years you were young, especially technological and medical advancements making life more convenient for others. \n\nThe graph also shows that this works the other way. The greater abundance of countries whose 15yr-24yr population have high faith in the future may have to do with youthful thinking and hope before it gets shattered with more experience (most likely corresponding with more years of living). \n\n3. The age range of people in my town is a bit over 40 years, and this makes me intrigued to learn more about our ways of thinking and view on if future improvements are feasible. \n\n4. \"Has Hope For Our Future Decreased?

This makes me wonder if there is some inaccuracy because I don't think people can really concept how the world was when with the older generation. The world is changing so much so fast that it would be hard to determine. Of course, you know major events that happen during history during that time but, if you didn't live through that point in time you can't really know. Also, I'm wondering if the younger people are more optimistic because they have been raised with the internet which gives them more hope and belief that the world will become better. Lastly, do more younger people think the world is becoming better based the economic situation in their country. I also wonder how the graph would look different if you surveyed the 40 and older generation when they were younger and see if their answers would differ.

This could lead to how the younger generation is more optimistic and believe a lot around generations being changed, compared to the 40+ year old are more stuck in the past rather than living in the future. \nThis makes me wonder if the world itself it more revolved around change or the past revolutions. How that connects to the 15-24 year old groups are more populated in rich areas. Also why is there a gap in between 25-39 years of age are they special? \n The top 50% of both sides is the representation of how the world is viewed by betterment and generations coming. \nOverall, this graph is saying that how different age groups are being viewed and how that can change the world view of different countries and vs the 40+ year old is more established. \nPossible Headline: how different age groups are changing our world ?",

People that are 40+ are more likely to have experienced hardships and trauma in their lives, which can make them less optimistic because they see the dark side of the society. Younger generations are more likely to have more hopes and dreams with the development of the society and with their careers. We can see that many countries in Africa show that they both the older and the younger generation are very optimistic. The graph is aimed towards both teens and older generations so they can think about why the graph produces such results. This graph shows a comparison of views, explicitly between different generations and different countries. The scatter plot can compare relationships between the variables, in this case the older and newer generation and the countries.

It took me a second to recognize, but the countries on the top left side of the line (positive residual) have higher percentages of younger adults than older adults who believe that the world is getting better, while on the bottom right (negative residual) show that the older adults think that the world is getting better more than, the younger adults. It makes sense that older people wouldn't believe that the world is improving since there are more progressive young adults and conservative older adults. This leads me to wonder, how would these statistics change as time continues to progress and younger adults become older adults? Since new concepts are built each generation, it makes sense that those older than the latest generation would have a hard time understanding how the world is changing and thus not want it to change. This is important to remember to ensure that the world truly continues to get better and that all generations can be excited and confident about those changes.",

The second thing that I noticed was that the countries inside of the 40+ boundary are not in Europe or the Americas, but in Africa and Asia. Does that show that middle aged adults are more confident in their successors compared to the west? Another thing that I noticed is that the younger generations feel much better about themselves versus the older generations. The disconnect between young people and older people about the future is more alarming than anything else.\n\nThe biggest thing that I wonder is how the younger generation is so optimistic, given that many of their key development years have been distorted due to the pandemic. Adults have had the privilege to go through decades of their lives without worrying the virus, so naturally shouldn't they be more hopeful that things would go back to normal?\n\nThis affects me and my community because my life has been effected because of growing up in the pandemic. As a member of the 15-24 year old group, I can say that we've been able to find hope and happiness despite all of the negative things that have been happening in the world.

The audience can be psychologists, therapists, counselors, or anyone concerned about mental health, directing them towards pessimistic adults and offering help. The meaning of this plot can mean the world is becoming a better place because present young adults didn\u2019t have to experience as much pain or suffering the 40+ years old adults did when they were younger. Another takeaway could be that older people have learned the negativity in our world through life experiences; hence, they are less optimistic. For instance, young adults could have big or unrealistic dreams and hopes for their future career, lifestyle, income, etc. But as they age, realizing the realities of how the real world works, it's easy to see why the older adults are less optimistic.

This graph would help us and geographers understand some people's views, which could lead to further research into why the younger generations have a positive prospect on their generation. It's indisputable that for even the most pessimistic country, Mali, the younger generation of the sample agrees that the world is improving. Why would the younger generations be so optimistic, why would the older generation be so pessimistic? There are many plausible reasons for this, firstly, the younger generation is born into a relatively more privileged and peaceful era, the worst a gen z could go through is the SARS or COVID-19 epidemics. I would say that most gen z's aren't hit by reality yet, the capacity for a gen z to think broad and critically is inferior to a gen x, the youth has baseless ambitions for future success, or rather, hasn't been hit by reality yet. Gen x is more pessimistic as they have most likely been hit with life and given up on some, they do not have the important resource - youth, health - that gen z has. This graph does show good news, improvement of any scale requires people with ambitions, and this graph ensures us that gen z's have the confidence of creating a better world.",

The data is from a survey in 2021 that included 21 countries. Indonesia has the highest score on this graph, and Mali has the lowest. In the US a larger percentage of people age 15-24 think the world is getting better than people age 40+.\n\n2. I wonder why people age 25-39 were not included on the graph. I wonder why this graph chose to show the difference in opinion between different age groups instead of showing the overall percent by country.\n\n3. This relates to me and my community because the US was included in this survey.

Depending on the country you are from, you could compare the results of the survey's data with your own results when collecting information from what you could reference as an older generation (40+ age range).

This graph is showing how different ages think about the future. Their optimism about which country will develop the most. I was able to guess that US would be popular among the young people, the ages between 15-24 years old, because US is known to the younger generation as a free country, so there is not many limited things, so this is what 15-24 years old younger generations think is good, but for 40 years old, who are already are adult, they might think no limitation  on younger people is not a good think. The 40 years olds, who are adult , they are more into religious countries and I think this is because when we get old we think more about our family and most people who has religions there practice of religion is to pray good for individuals, families, states, and the nation. They also think it might also improve health, learning, economic well-being, self-control, self-esteem, and empathy.\nI wonder what in Indonesia makes the younger generations and the adults to think Indonesia might be a better country in the future. \nThis impact me a lot because I am 15-24 years old and I think my homecountry, South Korea is also one of the country that is getting better as a generation. \nI recommend 'Which country might develop the most in the future?

The survey was fairly distributed (based on diversity) in these aspirations of generations bettering the world as time progresses. I have also noticed the lack of 40+ year-old participants, which I perceive as a sign that their opinion is rather less significant in this topic, because their generation has fundamentally passed. I believe that 15\u201324-year old\u2019s are more reliable in this survey, because they are the current generation and could be considered as people who still have time to take new steps to better the world.  I am genuinely fascinated, and wonder how people respond to this question. What is the criteria of \u2018better\u2019? Doesn\u2019t their environment affect the way they perceive the world? Due to this, this graph in my perspective is unreliable, these countries are in completely different circumstances (whether it\u2019s in terms of GDP, environment, health, safety etc.). Therefore, \u2018better\u2019 is complete bias. Different standards are incompatible. Coming from myself, a citizen of the poorest country in the world, Burundi, my standards of \u2018better\u2019, definitely can\u2019t be similar to the standards of someone from one of the richest countries in the world (USA).

Third world countries have greater optimism with the world getting better hopefully meaning that these countries are receiving more support or are developing at a faster rate. The older you get the less optimistic you get about the world which shows that experiences have a lot to say about the way that you view the earth. The more experiences you have, the more negative your thoughts are which can show that the world isn't actually getting better and you could conclude that people aged 15-24 have less leverage due to their lack of experience and existence on the face of the earth. Younger generations have not seen the world change as much as older people which means that people aged 40+ are able to make a clearer judgement when it comes to the world getting better. However, there is no single generation that conclusively thinks the world is getting better which clearly shows that personal experiences (that do not relate to the world as a whole) have a massive effect on your judgement of the question. \n\nI wonder whether we can ever say that the world is getting better.

A relevant example is as housing prices soar, median salaries stagnate, it is easy to see why the common person can be optimistic when they are young, hoping to be millionaires, but once realizing the realities of our current economy, it can be depressing.

For the age between 15 to 24 years old, they were both born in the year around 2000 and experience an extreme pace of development. Could you imagine that 15 years ago most of us are using little smarts and only have the function of communication and now we are using the latest version of the iPhone, Huawei, Samsung with a lot of different functions?  I don't need to explain the convenience that smartphones bring to people's lives, do I? Everyone can see it. With the ability to connect all over the world and share their lives, play games, watch videos......at any time and anywhere, which young people can imagine what life was like before the popularity of the Internet and smartphones decades ago?\nThis may be a big reason for this phenomenon.\n2.

One thousand people out of the U.K.\u2019s 67 million people is a mere 0.0015%, which cannot precisely tell what the people of the U.K. generally think about this question. In addition, these interviews are not done in person or through video chats, but through telephone calls, which means that respondents don't have to take it seriously. This further takes away the credibility of the polls. While we could argue that covering 1,000 respondents from every country is still a pretty large sample size since it\u2019s not possible to cover everybody or interview everybody in person, we should still leave our doubts on the credibility of the polls. In addition, the poll was asking respondents to address what they think regarding the entire world, but most people might only think about their own country, because that\u2019s what matters most to them and that\u2019s what they care about, but what they think about their own countries do not necessarily have a relationship with whether or not the world is getting better. This potential loophole could also adulterate the authenticity and relevance of the survey results regarding the question. But despite all these accounts, this was still an interesting survey that is worthy of noting and further researching.",

Adults who are aged more than 40 have had enough of these havocs, and they have been hoping that things will gradually settle down when the U.S.S.R. collapsed. However, the exact opposite has happened. The disappointment is huge, and so did the hope of having a nonviolent world drop. This should happen to be the answer to why adults aged more than 40 are generally more pessimistic about the current world than young adults aged between 15 to 24 in the poll. These young adults grew up in the best of times with pervasive high-end technologies and democracies, so they have no idea what the quadragenerians have lived through in their childhood and adolescence, which was an era dominated by political animosity between Western democracies and Eastern communist dictatorships, giving rise to a myriad of global conflicts. That explains why younger adults have generally more positive thoughts on the world\u2019s status quo.",

While both Brazil and India seem to be going through a very rough time, there\u2019s a surprisingly huge gap between the number of Brazilians in the poll who deems that the world has gone better and the number of Indians who deems that the world has gone better. For Brazil, less than 30% of young adults and less than 25% of adults expressed optimism about the world\u2019s status quo, compared to poll takers from India, where more than 60% of young adults and adults expressed optimism about the world\u2019s status quo.

In my opinion, this discrepancy happens because adults who are older than 40-year-old have more knowledge and experience about how the world has changed over the past half-century, as to young adults who have only witnessed the change over the past one or two decades, so older adults usually possess more visual and tangible opinions to whether or not the world is getting better with each generation.

The points you bring up about why some countries are more optimistic than others and why youth tend to be more optimistic than adults are very appropriate.  In addition to political conflicts and environmental conditions, you may want to consider the countries\u2019 economies, education attainment and opportunities to advance.  \n\nRegarding the sample size, this is a major topic in studying statistical inference.  (This is a study using inference since we are trying to infer what the population thinks from a sample.)  You may want to search online for an introduction to sample size determination. Quite surprisingly, if the sample is randomly chosen (each member of the population is equally probable to be selected), a sample of size of about 1,000 is considered adequate for any population size.  \n\nPlease go to the UNICEF interactive site \u201cThe Changing Childhood.\u201d  (UNICEF sponsored this international, intergenerational study.)

For example people who are young tend to wear clothing that shows a lot of skin thinking that they are an adult and feeling mature. From my eyes it looks like they are trying to impress others with their riches and fame. My mom told me that when you see someone dance you can tell if they are dancing cause they love to or just dancing to impress others. When they are trying to impress others it feels desperate. Another example is body image, I feel like what you see online will make you try it, which can really hurt you physically and mentally.\n\n1.

    "comment info": "\"The Opinions of Generations!\"\n\nFirst of all the most noticeable thing on the graph is that more 15-24-year-olds voted than 40+ year-olds. Another point to be made is within the 15-24-year-olds category there are many more countries and many of them are more developed compared to the countries in the 40+ year-olds category. This leaves me wondering why these countries have the response they do and why these questions were targeted specifically towards these generations. As a member of the 15-24-year-old category, I am exposed to many online sources for me to access information on the latest political and social news happening in all parts of the world. I feel as if this access to daily events gives me an advantage and a more open-minded opinion on this matter. 40+ year-olds come from a very different generation and have been raised differently and would most likely not have the knowledge or access to the internet as other generations who use it in their daily lives. Many 40+ year-olds do have the knowledge and are also exposed to the media but in a different way to how we use it. As to what is happening in the graph I believe a majority of 15-24-year-olds said that the world is getting better with each generation because we are the ones who will be living in it for a longer time and molding it into our own world. I trust the results of this graph even though I may disagree with them however, I support UNICEF so I am interested in discovering the reason behind these results.",

I guess these are the reasons why 15-24 year olds people in Mali think the world is not getting better. Comparing to Mali, Indonesia is classified as a newly industrialized country, which means they have a really good technology and environment. So I guess that's why 15-24 year olds people in Indonesia think the world is getting better.",

I notice that from all the countries surveyed, younger people believed that the world does get better with new generations. I wonder if age has to do with the results. I wonder why countries like Brazil and Mali are less optimistic than countries like Indonesia. This graph relates to me because I fall into the younger age group and I do believe that new generations do better the world especially when you think about how much people fought for their rights.

I also noticed that far more 15 to 24 year old's said the world is getting better than those who are +40 years old.

There are a few places where - by a narrow margin - older people are more positive, but it is more common for young people to be substantially more optimistic.  Japan and the US stand out as having round about a 40% gap between proportions of young and old saying the world is getting better.
