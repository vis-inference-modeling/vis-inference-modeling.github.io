    "comment info": "I notice first in these graphs that each color represents something different, whether it be a record, a current finding, or a prediction. It is obvious that southern states have drastically higher temperatures than northern cities this time of year. In a lot of these cities, people are experiencing drastic temperature fluctuations.  Atlanta, Boston, Minneapolis, and New York are all cities that experienced 30-degree differences in just five days. In other cities, temperatures are not near the expected temperatures, but rather near the record highs and lows. Cities like Dallas, Fort Myers, Orlando, and Tampa all reached temperatures above the normal high. More rare were cities dipping below their normal lows, but it did happen briefly in Denver and Minneapolis.\nWhat I am most curious about in this graph is the cause for such drastic fluctuations in weather and why many cities are experiencing extreme highs and lows in temperature. This is likely in part due to global warming. I am also curious if the cities whose forecasts were rather drastic reached their predicted temperatures. \nThis relates to me and my community because we have been experiencing drastic weather ourselves. Here, the weather was nearing zero degrees last week, but just days later it neared 50 degrees. \nA catchphrase for this graph is \"Wacky Weather Sweeps the Nation\".",

Boston had temperatures over 40 degrees for four consecutive days. Additionally, Denver had temperatures reaching 60 degrees and some days forecasted to go over 60. Where areas in the north the temperature is increasing, it is the opposite for places in the south. Both Houston and Phoenix in the southern states of Texas and Arizona dropped to low temperatures reaching 40 and under, which is unlike usual weather during this time. I also notice that while in some areas, the temperatures remain consistent over the days from December 6 to December 10, some areas have varying  drops in temperature. In Boston, it goes from reaching the 50s, to dropping down to almost 20 degrees in the forecast. \nI wonder why some places have greater temperatures drops and rises than others that are more consistent. \nThis relates to me and my community because it is noticeable the unnatural temperatures that New Jersey is experiencing in the months of winter that should be colder. The weather has been reaching near the 60s, which is irregular around this time. Last year it was snowing around the same time that the temperatures are rising now.

The temperatures fluctuated quite a bit and there are some consistencies depending on the area.  For example, New York and Boston are in a relatively similar area and their temperatures increased and decreased in a similar way.  The main thing I notice is how the normal temperatures were quite different than the ones recorded.  Some cities like Detroit and Dallas experienced much higher temperatures than normal.  On the other hand, cities like Los Angeles and Seattle are experiencing lower temperatures.  I wonder what the cause for these changes is.  It is understood that the weather will not be the same every year, but many of these changes are rather drastic.

For example, on the first Wednesday in NY, the temperatures reached a high of nearly 60 degrees, and the low was nearly 55 degrees; all while the average highs and lows for that day are between what looks like 38 degrees and 48 degrees. I also noticed that the highest record highs are usually found in the west -- most of the highs in the east coast don't even reach the 80s -- but the lowest record for the lowest temp. is found in Minneapolis, a city in a midwestern state. The longest record range belongs to Denver as well.\n2) I wonder if the variations of temperature in the eastern coast are due to some of the states being near more bodies of water compared to the more western states. The temperatures could also depend on whether the state is closer to the equator or the North Pole. I also wondered how global warming has affected the average temperatures compared to those in the past.\n3) This relates to me in my community, because although there isn't a city from my state present within the charts, NY is relatively close enough for us to have similar temperatures. Because of that, we've also experienced odd temperatures such as being extremely cold one day and regular temperatures the next.

This was interesting to me as now I wonder what causes East coast temperature to be more varied and why the temperature seems to follow this weekly pattern. This applies to my community as the temperature can reveal information about the climate. For instance, rising temperatures can indicate global warming. To ensure our Earth and its communities are safe looking at the environment and parts of it can inform us about issues and possible solutions.

The highest temperature is in the high 50s almost 60 degrees and the lowest is in the 30s. Although, throughout the week it seems to be colder than the weekend. I would say at least half of the cities have a larger range like New York such as Detroit, Boston, Denver, etc. I would say they show a significant change in temperature throughout the 10 days. \n\nWhat do you wonder? I wonder if global warming is a factor in the drastic temperature changes. One day the temperature is high and the next is relatively low. Global warming is known for causing irregularities in temperatures. \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community? This relates to me and my community because New York is our neighbor state. Typically, any temperatures in New York are also felt and affect New Jersey. It is very unusual to experience warm weather in December, yet some days it is freezing.

Many of these changes are most likely attributed to the city's industrialisation and daily mobility. It is a very commercial city with a high level of production and a close link with the weather. So much carbon dioxide produced will influence the temperature.\n\n-This is relevant to my neighborhood since New York is close to mines.

I also noted that they indicated in the graph background information that they updated the graph on December 12. The cities covered tended to be prominent places in the United States, such as New York City, Chicago, and Atlanta. In addition to reaching some record high temperatures. Cities that lie in the same state also tend to have similar temperature patterns which include the cities of Florida: Miami, Tampa, and Orland. The graphs are based on preliminary data and have a key indicating which shows the lowest temperature and the highest. \n2. I'm curious as to why temperature varies so drastically; could this be linked to global warming or other environmental factors?\n3. This is significant to my community and myself since it has the potential to change every day routines and raise new concerns. The fluctuating and unpredictable temperature indicates the impact that humans have on the world as a result of factors such as climate change. This current problem has been produced primarily by humans polluting without being aware of the negative consequences. Climate change has the potential to influence the severity or frequency of current health issues.

Living in Massachusetts, it's not really surprising, but I wonder why the trends for Boston fluctuate wildly from high temperatures to low temperatures throughout the week.\n\n3.As a resident of one of these cities, Boston in particular, it affects the daily activities we may want to do indoors or outdoors.\n\n4.

Global warming/climate change is a serious topic covered in our world today. For a cold month like December, the temperatures in America sometimes seem to be a little too high. Boston, for example, is a city that typically has very low temperatures in the winter. However, during the 10-day period, there were times when the temperature almost reached 60\u00b0F. Global warming could be a reason behind this.\n\n 4. What's going on in this graph? Throughout the 10 days, Miami, Orlando, Tampa, Ft.

All cities in Florida are consistently warm, meaning that temperatures are very similar from each day to the next.\n\nSomething I wonder about the figure is why the western cities are more in the range of the normal high and low temperatures, whereas other cities are having more abnormal temperatures.  \nI also wonder why Floridian cities typically have the same temperature from day to day. And how do these graphs affect tourism? What can we predict? The average temperature is higher and lower on specific days of the week...\n\nThe figure relates to my community as it reflects upon the idea of global warming, which based on the figure is an issue that I should be more concerned about, along with the people around me. Around my area, there are more temperatures that are higher than the average high temperature.
