We will need to figure our way out of the economic ponzi scheme the modern markets have set up, that relies on ever increasing and expanding consumerism to not collapse.",

    "comment info": "Looking at this graph, I see that birth rates have dropped a lot worldwide since 1960. Most countries, like the U.S., France, and Canada, now have fewer than two children per woman. Israel is one of the few countries with a higher rate, and while families in Africa are still larger, their birth rates are also going down. I\u2019m curious about what has caused these changes. Is it because of higher living costs, more women going to college and working, or changing ideas about family and parenthood? I also wonder how these trends will shape future generations, economies, and the balance between young and older people. This relates to my community because the cost of living keeps rising, making it harder for many families to afford having multiple children. As housing, education, and everyday expenses continue to increase, people are choosing to have fewer kids or delay starting families altogether. By the time my generation reaches the stage of having children, the birth rate will likely be even lower, as financial stability will play an even bigger role in family planning and people\u2019s ability to raise children comfortably.\n    \n    A catchy title could be : How Rising Costs Are Shrinking Future Families",

The lines on the graph have gotten significantly lower from 1960 to 2020, and I believe this is because it is a lot more expensive to have as many children as compared to that of a family in the 1960s. Children then were needed to help around the house and help with outdoor work, but now they do less and cause for more money and work from the parents. Even in Mexico, whose average in 1960 was 7 children, barely averages to about 2 children per family in 2020. Women today also have more of a choice if they want to get pregnant or not compared to women in the 1960s. \n    What do you wonder?\n    If inflation did not exist and children helped out more, would there still be a strong amount of families raising 5 to 7 children?\n    How does this relate to you and your community?\n    This relates to me because what if by the time I am a parent it is normal to only have one child because of just how much work and money it is. \n    Create a catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea.\n    Shrinking Families; Comparing 1960 to 2020",

The reason - lower infant mortality rates.  Particularly in the more advanced countries, for the last 2-3 generations, the child mortality rate has been very low.  The first generation or 2 still had multiple children out of habit, but since all of them lived, it got expensive.   The next generations had fewer children.  The children were also no longer needed as farm laborers, so the need to have 10 kids to help run the house and farm (or Alternatively go work in a factory at a young age to support the family) is no longer necessary.  \n    \n    This is not something to be surprised or scared of.  It is a good thing.  Less children dying and they have better childhoods in most cases.  The real headline here should be that better childhood outcomes lead to the need for less children.",

I observe that countries that are generally less affluent and have less infrastructure tend to have higher birth rates. Most women now opt to have only 1-2 children, with Central and Western Africa and Eastern and Southern Asia being exceptions, still having around 4-5 children. I wonder if this is directly influenced by the widespread women's rights and equality movements. Women today have more autonomy and face less social pressure to have children. These movements have also enabled women to pursue careers first and families later, which likely leads to fewer children. I also wonder if increased access to education plays a role. Girls are no longer dropping out of school to become wives and mothers; instead, they learn about sex education and contraceptives. The rise in autonomy means women can choose when to have children and have more control over their lives. I also consider whether the cost of living impacts this trend, making it less realistic to have many children and support a large family, even on two incomes. This affects me and my community because lower birth rates could lead to an underpopulation issue. From excess housing to economic consequences, a significant decrease in population size could cause many negative effects.",

Israel, U.S., Canada, Hungary, Norway, France, and Mexico are the lines in color. The total number of children born decreased significantly from 1960s to 2020 for all demographics. \n    What do you wonder?\n    Could it the be economical state that affected the decrease in children? Is culture a main factor in the amount of children a woman gives birth; different for each country. The U.S. also decreased a lot, we may consider our economical state, having a child is expensive, and very time consuming compared to other countries. Why are the countries with greater children born are in gray and the ones with less are in color. \n    How does this relate to you and your Community?\n    I personally live in a community with many of my classmates parent\u2019s having Israel descent, and I think that the graph is quite accurate as many of my classmates have 1-3 siblings. \n    Create a catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea.\n    Vanishing Cribs: Charting the Birth Rate Drop",

I am an AP Statistics teacher from Collinsville High School in Collinsville, Illinois just outside of St. Louis. I look forward to seeing what all you have to think about this week's graph and hope to learn something from you all!\n    \n    I'm going to participate with you all in this week's graph as well.\n    \n    What do you notice?\n    I notice some countries' birth rates have had small reductions over the past 65 years while other countries have had large reductions.  \n    \n    What do you wonder?\n    The lines with the highest birth rates are regions that make up multiple countries, so I wonder what the graph would look like instead with only individual countries. I also wonder what percentage of women not having any children has done over the past 65 years?  For my statistically minded students, I wonder what change there has been in the standard deviation in birth rates over the past 65 years.\n    \n    How does this relate to you and your community?\n    I wonder what the birth rates are around different regions of the US, specifically my community.  If the birth rate is too low in my area, then will fewer people around in the next generation cause strains on the local economy for businesses and more unemployment and/or will it help alleviate other strains like lack of housing?",

For instance Countries like France, United States, Norway, Hungary, Mexico, and Canada are all colored and bolded.

Over time, the average amount of children has decreased in almost all selected countries.

I think that childbirth rates have decreased due to more independence for woman and a decrease of traditional roles in the 2000s. I also think that even though older generations had more siblings they came from a less developed generation where food was scarce and education wasn\u2019t developed like it is now which is probably why women choose not to have children more than the 1900s etc.",

However, according to the graph, they start at close to 7 in 1960. But, by 1980 they are already close to 5. So, the decline started long before 1990. I like that you provide some insights as to why the decreases. You mention that women don't want as many kids. It might also be helpful to know that the population is growing despite the reduction in births. So, one reason for the reduction in births may not be necessarily that women want fewer children, but that the children that they have are living longer. So, they may not need to replace as many children who previously died as infants. But, that may just be one of many reasons. Keep noticing and wondering!",

(headline)\n    \n    I noticed that over time, the average number of babies a mother has in each country decreases. This could happen because the cost of having a child rose over time and because of inflation. I wonder if the reason is actually because of the state that the world is in, or if it is because of the people; maybe adults want to have fewer kids, or no kids at all. This relates to me and my community very little; my mom and dad have 6 kids, including me, and our neighbors have 2 or more kids, if married. So this data does make me see that other families don't have many kids, and it could be quieter in their houses.

    "comment info": "As we know, this make old people more numerous than the younger ones and creates a problem of supporting the older people with a smaller number of younger people that also need to support themselves. This situation leaves young people critically exposed as they are not only expected to preform this labour and \"keep the society running\", it also leaves them without much influence over it and its politics, as they are lesser in numbers to old people, and therefore any democratic change favouring young people is near impossible, as old people have a majority over them. This leaves young people, like myself, asking, how can we support our increasingly aging population when there is so few of us and so many of them? I believe the answer is immigration, because, if done properly, immigration helps rebalance the demographical structure and fills essential jobs that are needed. Of course this opens other questions of integration, national integrity and identity and global influence, including problems for poorer countries, such as brain drain. However, the immigrant usually do continue contributing to their home country and this push might be a strong current to push the country towards development. Here in Switzerland, immigrants quickly integrate into society due to integration programs and preform all kinds of jobs that the native Swiss population might not have the quantity to do. This leaves Switzerland largely demographically stable, despite low birth rate.",

I also noticed that in 1960, Canada had almost 4 children on average, and then it went down to 2. Lastly, the overall average of the children born to a woman in those regions and countries dropped down significantly. What do you wonder? I wonder why some of the birth rates went down as the years passed, it is too much money to raise them? How come earlier in the years, like 1960, half of the regions had almost higher than 4 children born? What made it so common to have more babies in the early years? This relates to my community because it shows that we no longer want to have that many kids anymore. China's a great example of this, because they implied a rule that said you could only have one child. The policy wasn\u2019t too great though, because there was gender imbalance and a lot of old people, with less young people to help them. The government tried to fix it by increasing the policy rate to 3, and paying you for your children, but China\u2019s population is still growing too slow. How does this relate to your community? This is important because it shows that this same problem with less birthrates could happen to other regions and countries later in the future.
