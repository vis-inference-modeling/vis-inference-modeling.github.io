Instead of being all bunched together, there are different levels of how conservative and liberal someone is. Democratic nominees have also gotten more liberal overtime as republican nominees tend to stay at the same level of conservative.

You noticed that the graph shows the years that justices sat on the bench.  Most importantly, you noticed the ideological trend of individual justices and of conservative and liberal justices as groups.  You must have wondered, \u201cWhat is a Martin-Quinn score?\u201d    Would you share with us where you found your information?  The fact that the score compares justices\u2019 ideologies to each other is key to understanding this graph.  Thank you for bringing this up at the beginning of our discussion.",

    "comment info": "I notice that the graph depicts the supreme court justices, what party they were nominated by, and how liberal or conservative they are on a \u201cMartin-Quinn score\u201d scale. There also is a \u201cmedian justice\u201d which I think refers to how overall liberal/conservative the bench as a whole is. It also shows how overtime the justices have shifted on the political scale. Some start pretty centrist and as the years pass become more liberal. Others start centrist and as the years pass become more conservative. I think the graph is simply referring to how liberal and conservative our U.S. Supreme Court is. I am curious about how the dates on the x axis of the graph work. Do those refer to when the justice was appointed to the supreme court? Justice Ginsburg was appointed in 1980 and her line starts around the 90s. Also what is a \u201cMartin-Quinn score\u201d. How is it measured? A catchy headline for the graph could be \u201cJustice is Served\u201d.",

On Monday, the 2018 - 2019 session opened with the announcement of cases they will take on.\nYou notice that there is a line for median justice.  I wonder how this compares to the Martin-Quinn score of zero.  (You may want to search for what is the Martin-Quinn score, how it is calculated, and what it means.)  Regarding your questioning the start of Justice Ginsburg\u2019s confirmation, viewers should always examine and confirm the inputs to a graph.  Do a quick search to see if the graph is in error.",
