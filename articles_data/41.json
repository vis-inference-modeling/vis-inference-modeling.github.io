They are capitalizing on the desire by many to have a better life, escape dangers in their homeland.   The huge increases seem to be choreographed just in time for the elections! Maybe  MAGA is  even helping fund $$ messages to these  citizens that the 'U.S borders are open' (that's what some migrants on interview say re phone calls and media  they rec'd ) If Mr Trump is requesting inaction on the Congressional Border Bill to keep Biden from looking successful, why would he not also use his connections with the Dictators to increase the migration and embarrass Biden!

This suggests the United States' high-security borders. About 2 million encountered were processed under Title 8, and only two thousand have gotten relief and are not in ongoing procedures. This may mean that the process is complex and lengthy. Of the 2.5 million encountered, a substantial number were expelled under Title 42. I wonder how 600-thousand were able to enter undetected, being that the border seemingly has a lot of control. Additionally, I wonder what the graph would look like if we could see the outcomes of those who entered undetectedly.

In this graph, 1.8 million people who attempted to cross the border are in ongoing proceedings or legal limbo while 870,000 people have deportation orders, expulsion, etc. In addition, 600,000 immigrants entered undetected. Clearly, from this statistic, the border is not as secure as the government makes it seem as there is still a significant amount of people sneaking into this country illegally.  Title 42 says that when non-citizens enter the US on an illegal basis they will be processed for removal. Title 42 does not impose immigration or criminal consequences on migrants. Therefore, migrants who are expelled can repeatedly try and cross the border. I wonder how many migrants this past year attempted to cross the border for the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th time as a result of this law. I wonder how many of those migrants found undetected ways to enter. I also wonder why people would travel thousands of miles to this country and voluntarily depart once they begin being processed under Title 8. Is being processed really that bad? 180,000 people voluntarily departed once they began being processed under Title 8!

It's unclear how many unauthorized immigrants there are and how long they've been in legal limbo.\nPerth Amboy, where I live and work and which attracts a lot of immigrants, worries about the ongoing immigration issues that its residents face. In an effort to provide for their families and become financially successful in the future, many immigrants, both first and second-generation, put a lot of effort into their employment.

I wonder what the parameters are around spelling people from the border and what makes them eligible for staying. I also notice how few cases are not border cases. It is interesting to see how long of a process it is to become a resident, with the graph not even showing the final step in becoming a resident. Having the end of the graph be ongoing/limbo shows how lengthy and painful of a process it is to immigrate to the USA. Many people who cross the border are seeking safety and a home, so the long and troublesome proceedings create further difficulty for these families. It is troublesome that such a large number of people are deported during the process. I wonder how people are evaluated or why they choose to leave when they have already started the process of immigrating. This issue has an impact on the country as a whole. It is meant to be a place of prosperity and opportunity, but the way the border is handled contradicts that. People struggle to come to a country that promises the right to live and work freely. I love far from the border, but its impacts stretch through the whole country because of how important it is to reform.

In total, it is estimated that 3.1 million people tried to enter the US through the southern border. Out of the total, 1.8 million are going through legal endeavors because of their status, 870,000 were pushed back to their native country, and around 602,700 people have gone undetected or were granted amnesty. Considering so many people were turned away from the US under Title 42, what will happen now that Title 42 has come to an end? Title 42 was lenient in the sense that, unlike Title 8, people attempting to cross the southern border could try again and again; no one was banned. Will future policies on immigration begin to get more strict? Will those already integrated into American society who may lack citizenship be harmed? As New Jersey is an asylum state, many immigrants in my community have not been granted citizenship yet. In the upcoming presidential election, with immigration and borders being a highlighted topic, I worry for the members of my community and how this could impact them.\n\n\u201cCrossing The Southern Border: The Odds of Success\u201d",

It is very interesting to see that they're not all just under one category per se but they can go under things such as Title 8 or could be considered \"Non-border cases.\" Additionally, I noticed that it is truly difficult to try to cross the border undetected since so many were discovered or snuck in and were then deported. \n\nWhat I wonder is how people manage to keep track of all of these \"cases\" and if yes, how many are not included within the 3.1 million attempted crossings? Also what are the different ways immigrants manage to sneak in undetected by government officials or border patrol?\n\nWhat's going on in this graph is it is trying to show the different ways each immigrant was either allowed, rejected, sent back after managing to enter the country, or so many other attempts at trying to start a different life for themselves. It is also emphasizing the amount of people who are truly trying to enter the country and want to leave the current one they are in. \n\nThis relates to my community because there is a lot of politics surrounding immigration and I hear a lot of problems related to it within the news or how tons and tons of immigrants are sent primarily to New York City, which already is overpopulated, and the city is trying to manage the buses being sent their constantly.",

A good chunk of migrants are able to pass into America undocumented, while the majority encounter US forces. Of these approximated 2.5 million people who are processed by the US, another chunk is expelled or undergo other forms of deportations. However, the majority are put into the legal system and are in limbo, awaiting a court answer.\nI wonder why so many people are in long-term legal limbo. Immigration from the southern border is such a big issue, so why hasn't the government allocated more resources to processing immigration cases? If the judicial process was easier, less people would feel the need to enter America undocumented. \nAs someone who lives in America, I think that it's truly wrong that so many people who want to live here are hindered at every step by the government of the very place they want to live in. \nHeadline: WHERE DO THEY GO?

I notice that among these illegal migrants about 600,000 entered the US without detection. The process of becoming a US citizen is a tough one, which is why many desperate migrants feel the need to cross the southern border into the US illegally. The majority of immigrants who are not forced or choose to leave the United States are still in a place of uncertainty and a state of processing, about 1.8 million are still being processed. Immigration and the safety of the Southern border is a major topic in this present political climate. I wonder when the government is going to get its act together and fix its border protection laws. Recently, an illegal Venezuelan immigrant murdered a University of Georgia student and has a lengthy criminal record. This shows that the immigration process and the process of border protection need to be changed to prevent more killings of Americans.

Recently, they have written about factors that add up to illegal crossings, compromises for legislation, and public opinion on immigration.  \n\nI would also recommend looking at the November 16, 2023 Pew Research Center\u2019s \u201cImmigration & Migration\u201d report and the February 15, 2024 \u201cHow Americans View the Situation at the U.S.-Mexico Border, Its Causes and Consequences.\u201d  As seem with both President Biden and ex-President Trump at the Texas border this past weekend, it is expected that this will be a major topic for the November election.",

Of these, 870,000 have been deported, with only 2,700 granted relief or residency. In 2023, 3.1 million persons attempted to enter the United States over the southern border, 1.8 million completed legal procedures, 870,000 returned to their home countries, and approximately 602,700 went unnoticed or awarded amnesty.\n\n2) The end of Title 42 raises questions about the future of undocumented immigrants and the duration of their legal limbo, as it was lenient in allowing repeated attempts to cross the southern border, unlike Title 8. The estimated number of undocumented immigrants and their duration in legal limbo remains uncertain.\n\n3) My community of Perth Amboy, an attraction for immigrants, is concerned about the persistent immigration challenges that its inhabitants encounter. Many first and second-generation immigrants work hard to improve the lives of their families in the hopes of achieving financial success in the future.

In total, it is estimated that 3.1 million people tried to enter the US through the southern border. Out of the total, 1.8 million are going through legal endeavors because of their status, 870,000 were pushed back to their native country, and around 602,700 people have gone undetected or were granted amnesty.

The rest were either deported (~28.1%) or processed (~61.3%). Of the 1.5 million people who underwent immigration court cases, very few were granted relief (around 0.18%).\n\n2) I wonder why each immigration case is unique. How much does the ethnic background of a migrant affect what happens to them after attempting to cross the border?\n\n3) This relates to me because I come from a family of immigrants and they crossed the southern border and experienced this themselves just to give us a better life. It's easy to forget that these numbers are actual people whose dreams are to carve a brighter future for their children. This also relates to my community because NJ is one of the states with the highest population of immigrants. \n\n4) The Border Experience",

While about 81% are either Deported, expelled, in court, or relieved. Depending on your political standpoint this number 19% could be unacceptable, or great.\nI wonder the causation for people getting different outcomes when they encounter customs and border protection. Why do such a small percentage get relief, and why do most people have to go through legal troubles, or deportation? Me and many people from my community come from immigrant households. All while our parents are not illegal immigrants, getting into the US couldn't have been the easiest road for our parents.

Title 42 was lenient in the sense that, unlike Title 8, people attempting to cross the southern border could try again and again; no one was banned.

There is a larger amount of people who enter the United States through the southern border and stay, both detected and undetected, than the amount of people who enter the United States through the southern border and are expelled.\nI wonder why out of all of the people who have been in immigration court cases, only a few of them have been granted relief. Only 2.7K people have been granted relief, while more than 600 times that are still dealing with legal proceedings.\nThis does not have a large impact on my community since I live in a small town in New Hampshire. New Hampshire is very far away from the southern border, so the majority of the issues that are happening in those states don\u2019t affect us. Since I live in a small town, it is very unlikely that the people who cross the border will be moved here.

The graph shows different paths that break off from each other and then lead to new outcomes, but all 2.5 million migrants found will ultimately be faced with a negative journey in the legal or deportation path. \n2. I wonder if this graph will push for any legislation to fix this overwhelming issue. I also wonder how this graph breaks down the section regarding processing under Title 8. What actions or decisions are given to migrants before extreme measures are taken? \n3. The problem of migrants coming over the border impacts my community in many ways. It causes an overwhelming amount of people to take over cities and communities. As these people are technically (though they should not be) illegal, they cannot find places to live, eat, or be employed. This can add to the homeless population of communities ultimately affecting how that community functions.

It was interesting to note the amount of people that entered and were undetected, around a 600k estimate. It was interesting to see that there were two titles that the people were evaluated under, Title 8 and Title 42, but with Title 42, 565k were deported.\n2. After looking at the graph I have questions about what the Title 8 and Title 42 are specifically about. What sorts of things do they look at and what factors determine how they are used? How big of a role does Title 42 and Title 8 play in this process?\n3. It is eye opening to see the process that those who cross the Southern border have to go through. There are so many different things that could happen and factors that could impact their future just in this process alone. It is disheartening to see that only 2.7k out of the 3.1 million people that attempted to cross the border received relief. I would say that the attempted crossings at the Southern border do not have as large of an impact on my community which is closer to the northern US borders. \n4. Cross or Not?

One striking statistic is that only 2,700 immigrants, out of the 3.1 million person total, become legal citizens of the United States (0.08%). Additionally, 185k immigrants are forced into expedited removal which the National Immigration Forum describes as deportation in as little as one day without a hearing. Interestingly, about 58% of cases result in proceedings or \u201clegal limbo\u201d. \n2. What do you wonder?\nI wonder how are expedited removals and deportations carried out. Are the immigrants literally put on planes or vans back into their home countries? How is the total of undocumented immigrants calculated? Why do some choose voluntary departure? Lastly, how does the US court system determine who is eligible or who should deserve relief? How can we help process immigration cases faster and help immigrants access better opportunities?\n3.

Also, why do they include the 180k of non-related border cases in the 1.8 million court dealings? \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\n -This relates to my community by informing people of the details of the border by giving specific data that represents whether the immigrants stay in the United States, how many are expelled, etc. \n\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea\n- 2023 Overview of Immigration into the United States through the Southern Border",
