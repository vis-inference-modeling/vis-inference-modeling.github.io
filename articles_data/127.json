I notice that basketball (men's and women's) has the highest percentage of colored players. \n\nWonder: I wonder why there are so many non-colored coaches in the leagues. Are non-colored coaches better at coaching overall? Is it just because of the history of coaches? Why does major league soccer have the highest percentage of colored coaches? I also wonder why basketball has the highest percentage of colored players.\n\nImpact: This impacts the community of sports. These statistics show that there is a less percentage of people of color in higher positions such as coaches. We need more representation in these jobs of higher power and control.\n\nWhat is going on in this graph?\nThey are comparing the percentages of people of color for players and head coaches in different sports leagues. \n\nCatchy Title: We have diversity on the field, but what about behind the scenes on the sideline?",

Our community is impacted because it shows that people of color have an equal opportunity to be a player in some sports.

A potential issue with this could be that coaches often maintain their jobs for a very long time when compared to the players. \nI wonder why this study excluded important sports leagues such as the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League. While the NBA has a very high percentage of diversity amongst the players in their league, it also wields a very low diversity percentage for their coaches. Then, when considering the NHL, there are only 43 professional players in the entire league that are of color. Out of upwards of 620 players, it truly shows how undiverse a sport like that is. So a sport like that would be a good equalized contradiction to the graphs being shown.\nThis has a large impact on me and my community because I come from a city with very little diversity. Growing playing sports, most of my teams have always been predominantly white and the same for our coaches. Meaning that because of the lack of diversity within our community, also reflects itself upon the sports we play.\nThe graphs in this article depict the gap between the diversity of the players of sports and the diversity of the coaches of the sports in large national sports.

Less than 50% of every league\u2019s coaching staff are people of color. However, more than 50% of every league\u2019s players are people color, besides baseball. MLS has the highest percentage of coaches of color, but is not necessarily the most diverse because it has the second-lowest percentage of players of color.

However, I wonder why there's such a significant disparity between the percentage of players of color and coaches of color in every major sports league?

This graph shows the major difference between the number of players of color and the number of coaches of color.A catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea is, \u201cPlay Ball!

This may mean that talent leads to POC landing player roles, but because of systemic racism and other things in society it is harder for POC to climb up in managerial roles and earn higher wages. Also, there is quite a gap in the percentages between players of color and coaches of color. The largest gap is in the NFL with a 61% gap, and the second-largest gap is in the WNBA with a 58% gap. From this graph, I wonder how the data in this graph from the years 2019 and 2020 compares to past years. It would also be interesting to see how this data compares with sports teams across the globe. One last thing I wonder is what our society can do to break down whatever challenges or barriers are preventing more POC from becoming head coaches. I feel that this data impacts my community in the fact that it is reflective of it. Much of our society is built on systemic racism and for this reason, POC face challenges every day because of their skin color. The fact that such a glaring difference in racial distribution is apparent in big sports leagues makes me wonder how much worse it is on a smaller, more local scale.

I also notice that there are more head coaches of color in the Major League of Soccer despite having the lowest percentage of players of color. I wonder as to why it is that we see these trends among race with specific sports. I wonder if it is a cultural aspect that makes it so that more people of color are inclined to play basketball and football over soccer because there are way less people of color who actually play soccer. I wonder if they feel unwelcomed or whether it is a predominantly white sport. The impact that this has on my community is that it helps me understand a lot more as to why I see this trend. Coming from a predominantly person of color community, I do understand that a lot more people are interested in football and basketball because it is a sport that many of us were exposed to growing up from a young age.

However, the NBA has a greater percentage of colored head coaches than the WNBA by five percent. I believe the number of coaches of color and coaches who are women collaborates; the fact is that both of their numbers are extremely low compared to those of white males. The reasoning for this? I am not sure. Possibly because men who are white are more likely to get the job because of their appearance, even if the other colored coaches are a better fit for the job. My greatest assumption of why white coaches are more common in these major league sports than those of color is because these issues of racial inequality have not been addressed as profoundly as they have been this past year, especially with the Black Lives Matter Movement. Many of these coaches have been doing their jobs for what could be the last decade. I do think it would be unfair for a perfectly capable coach to be fired if he or she is white because the team thought they needed more diversity within their coaching staff. I do not think race should be involved in the decision of hiring coaches; whoever best fits deserves the position.",

One of the greatest baseball players, Hank Aaron, was not allowed to play with a white team until 1953. He still faced discrimination after that. This shows how much our country has grown and changed. I also wonder how hard it is to get on one of the competitive teams with your race.

I can\u2019t help but wonder if this is because of the smaller sample size of the head coaches.\n\nIn the MLB\u2019s case, there are only 30 managers total, one for each team. Each team has, at most, a 40-player expanded roster. With 30 teams in the league, there can be a maximum of 1,200 players that play for the MLB at once. The difference between the minuscule amount of managers and the much larger number of players makes me wonder how much the sample size comes into play. If each team had a 1:1 manager/player ratio, would the percentage of head coaches of color still only be 20 percent?\n\nThe issue of the small sample size also is relevant in each one of the other sports. The NFL has the highest number of head coaches, at 32. The NFL has more than 1,500 active players every year, which gives a much higher opportunity for diversity than the mere 32 coaches. When it comes down to it, I think the reason the percentages of diversity are much lower in coaches is because of availability. The average NFL player\u2019s career only lasts 3.3 seasons, whereas the average NFL head coach\u2019s career is nearly a full year longer, averaging out at 4.3 seasons. To me, the long career, as well as the limited availability, are very large factors in whether or not a position is diverse or not, because the positions are not being filled as quickly.",

I'm glad you joined our conversation!\n\nIn your first paragraph you wonder about a smaller sample size for coaches, and some good reasoning to explain your thinking. There are two reasons I don't think this explains it. First, these aren't samples. We have a smaller population of coaches, but there is no sampling going on. But the reasoning can be similar, if we wonder whether random variation could account for the difference with smaller groups of coaches. This bring up my second point. Smaller sample sizes would mean more variability in the percentages, not a difference in the average percentage. So if the smaller group is the explanation, what we'd expect to see is some cases where the percentage of coaches is smaller and some where it is bigger. We're not seeing that!\n\nThe difference in length of career could be a factor if more coaches were still around from an earlier time. You have looked up the average career lengths.

I think I might have an answer to your question about whether the small percentage of coaches of color compared to players of color is due to discrimination or coincidence. Looking at the set of graphs, we have five different data sets. If the smaller proportion of coaches of color was due to random chance, I would expect some variation in proportions across sports. For example, there could be a larger proportion of coaches of color compared to players of color in baseball, a smaller one in soccer, and perhaps an even balance in football. However, there is a small proportion of coaches in every single sport shown. This tells me that it is very unlikely to be due to random chance, and so there is evidence that outside factors such as discrimination are at work.",

This made us wonder why this gap in player and coaching representation exists. We also noticed that soccer and baseball have the lowest percentage of colored players. On the other side of it, Major League Soccer has the highest percentage of head coaches of color. Another thing we noticed was that all of the data is from 2020 except for one group, the Women\u2019s National Basketball Association which is from 2019. This makes you curious as to why they would include data from a different year only for one of the groups. This also made us wonder why they would only show one women's sport out of the 5 sports showcased. Lastly, we noticed that for the MLB, managers were counted as head coaches instead of the actual coaches being counted. This made us wonder why they would have to count managers and not head coaches like they did for every other sport. From our observations and wonderings, we thought of the data\u2019s impact on our community. For one, it makes it clear that to our community that there is a major problem with underrepresented coaches of color in professional sports. From that it makes us question what we as a community can do to lessen this issue.",

That major league soccer has the most head coaches of color and that national football league has the least. I also noticed that the women's national basketball association has the most players of color while the major league baseball has the least.\n\nI wonder why the number of colored players almost always outnumbers the colored coaches by 3 times. I wonder why soccer players have so many more coaches of color compared to every single other sport. I wonder why the NFL a sports league with a very high percentage of colored players has the lowest percentage of colored coaches, especially compared to the MLB with such a low percentage of colored players but a high percentage of colored coaches. \n\nWhen I look at these statistics, It makes me wonder if people of color are getting the same opportunities in the community when it comes to different roles in sports. It looks like they get great opportunities to play the sports but not as many opportunities to be managers or coaches in the sports. We should be looking at giving people of color more opportunities to be in management positions at a younger age, so that when they grow up we will have more of them managing sports teams professionally.",

    "comment info": "Summary:\n \nIt is a graph showing the percentage of players and coaches with color in some sports. Based on the sports and the names of the sports associations, we can assume that these are sports associations that are based in the United States.  We\u2019ve noticed that most of the sports have a vast majority of colored players, while most of the coaches are white. Colored athletes in basketball are well represented compared to other sports. However, coaching has a much lower percentage of minorities. We wonder why the head coaches are less likely to be people of color because for each sport the percentage of color for coaches is lower than players? We also wonder why soccer has such a high percentage of coaches of color compared to the other sports, could it be because it is more widely played in other parts of the world so there\u2019s a wider variety of coaches? This data may impact our community because it is discouraging coaches of color to pursue a coaching position on more diverse teams. However, this could influence minorities or people of color to join sports, where everybody is included. You can become a professional player of any sport no matter your skin color. \n \nOur catchy headline for this graph is \u201cThe divide in diversity: the gap between diverse athletes and coaches\u201d",

    "comment info": "Based on the data provided in the graph, we found that despite a majority of sports having large percentages of players of color, there are far less coaches of color to represent them. As an example, the National Football League consists of 74% players of color, however, has only 13% coaches of color serving in the league. We also noticed that Major League Baseball tends to have the fewest players of color in comparison to other sports featured in the graph. These findings led us to question, why do the percentages of players of color seemingly have little correlation to the amount of coaches of color? Furthermore, the information presented in the graph affects both ourselves and our community in several ways. Underrepresentation in sports can have a major effect on young people of color who hope to pursue a career in professional sports and potentially hurt their aspirations. Our group also believed it was important for players and coaches to be able to have people around them who are different and have experienced different things in order for them to grow and be able to create relationships. Our headline for this article would be : \u201cMajor league sports in relation to coaches and players of color.\"",

After the basketball associations, the national football league has the second highest percentage of players of color. I also notice that the head coaches of color don't even come close to the percentage of players of color. Soccer has the highest percentage of coaches of color which makes sense since it is a more worldly sport. The more \u201cAmerican\u201d sports tend to have lower diversity in coaching staff. These sports would be football and baseball. We wonder why there are less coaches of color overall compared to players of color. Is it because there are simply more players of color or is it due to discrimination amongst coaches in those specific sports/leagues. Also, what could be the criteria/standards for being a coach? Maybe there\u2019s a specific reason why there are more players of color rather than pursuing a head coach career. This graph impacts our community by highlighting the lack of coaches and even people of color in leadership positions throughout school sports. This puts emphasis on the issue of racial inequality in the sports system. We think that if there were more coaches of color there would be more kids of color that would feel comfortable participating in these activities and that kids of color would also get more opportunities in the sport they chose to participate in. \nCatchy Headline: The lack of diversity in sports leadership",

I wonder if that makes it harder for for the players knowing that their coaches can\u00b4t relate to one of their biggest life challenges outside of the sport they play. This makes me question of the impact it might have on future coaches that are POC they must find this discourging knowing that although the athletes they will be coaching are like them their peers are not, leading them to have to face the challenges of being a pioneer in their profession. The diversty of the athletes in the sports should be the same or close to the same amount as those leading the athletes.",
