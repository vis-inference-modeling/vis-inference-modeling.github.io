The second thing I noticed was the main difference between the 2  maps; the 1st map breaks the states down by the number of electoral votes while the 2nd map shows states, their geographical borders, and how the state voted as a whole. The setup of the 2nd map is a bit misleading. For example, in Nebraska, Trump won the state, but Biden won the 2nd congressional district and 1 out of 5 of Nebraska's electoral college votes. An individual wouldn't be able to gather that information from the second map and would have a false sense of complete unity within each state. Whereas the 1st map highlights the disunity and conflicting views within states. I wonder which map is more commonly published and why. This has a large impact on me personally; I am a senior in high school, so the stance of the party in the White House holds on student loans will have a large impact on my financial situation throughout college and the beginning of my adult life. My community will also feel the impacts of this decision -- both beneficial and harmful. I live in a rural community that has a lack of access to adequate healthcare and the new administration's policy aims to improve that, but my community is also comprised of a majority of farmers, who were greatly dependant upon the subsidies under the Trump administration.

Because mail-in votes take slightly longer to travel to polling places, the heavily democratic mail-in votes from Philadelphia and Allegheny came in overwhelmingly for Biden, as they were mail-in, which Trump did not support and from already-Democratic areas.

This impacts myself anf the country because Donald Trump has done a lot in my opinion and has been reported for the Colored, LGTBQ, white, Mexican, and any other race then any president has as of recent. He has created one of the most jobs then any president. Although he has said a lot of controversial stuff on social medias such as twitter, as an American you should want our president to be truthful even if it hurts ones feelings. Donald Trump also has defeated big terrorist groups such as ISIS, and has helped America in many which ways.

    "comment info": "Both graphs show whether the state was won or flipped. However, I noticed that the first graph is more detailed than the second graph. The first graph shows the number of electoral votes per state and whether each individual vote was a win or was flipped. This depicts the election results better as the second map could mislead others since Trump won more states than Biden yet Biden still had the greater number of votes. I noticed that many of the flip states are blue. Many of the central states are red, while states in the New England area and West Coast are blue. \n\n I wonder why we tend to see graphs like the second which provides a more general overview rather than graphs like the first which provides more detail. I also wonder why Maine and Nebraska are the only states with split electoral votes. I wonder how the environment, culture, and lifestyle of each state affects the views of voters and the candidate that they end up voting for. I also wonder how this year's election graphs compare to those of past elections. \n\nThis impacts me and my community because it impacts the whole nation. The president plays an important role in our federal system. In addition, many people don't fully understand the Electoral College and how votes are secured. Massachusetts is known to be a democratic and blue state, so it's interesting to see how other states fall in the political spectrum. \n\nA headline could be \"Breaking Down the Election: Understanding the Electoral College.\"",

Are there any other more effective types of graphs? I also wonder, on a side note, why many conservatives are sure that Trump has won when Biden clearly received more electoral votes according to both of these graphs.\nThis has a huge impact on me and my community.

The first graph divides the states up into boxes that represent the number of electoral college votes. I notice that on this graph blue and red-colored states, but also a few navy blue states. Looking at the map it seems as though there are many more red states, but the bar on the top clearly states that Joe Biden won. I wonder why there aren't any really dark red states whereas there are some really dark blue states? I wonder why the news does not display the first map during the election? I feel like that would be a very helpful graph that people could easily understand and it could benefit not only my community but also the nation. This could also impact my community as each graph clearly displays what candidate my state voted for. \n\nTitle: \"Presidential Election of 2020\"",

The first graph shows which party each state voted for as well as how many electoral college members from each state had a say. By seeing this, it allows the audience to understand why Biden won. From looking at these graphs I notice that most mid west and southern states learn more  right whereas the west coast and north east lean more left. I wonder why that is and if the lifestyle and culture in those states contribute to the winning party in each state. This impacts my community because New Jersey is a very densely populated state yet normally always leans left. Because of this, I wonder how many Republicans vs Democrats are in the state of NJ. \nA catchy headline would be, \"A Closer Look Into This Years Election\"",

The bottom map shows the states together and just shows each states winner. Both maps differentiate Biden and Trump by blue and red, and also show flip states by striped lines. I also noticed that both maps show that most Trump supporters are in the middle states while Biden supporters seem to be mostly on the coasts. Lastly, I realized that most people focus on the bottom map rather then the electoral  map when looking at who won.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder what makes the west and east coast support Biden rather then Trump. Vice versa, I wonder what makes the middle states more prone to supporting Trump. What does the environment have to do with who you support? I wonder this because environment does seem to influence which candidate won in the state. \n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis impacts my community as an American in understanding the importance of looking at both electoral votes as well as overall votes in each state, and how this influences who won. It also impacts my community because living in the east coast it is interesting to see how almost all east coast states voted blue in the electoral map and overall map. \n\nA headline for this graph can be \"Blue or Red, Biden Is The Ultimate Winner On These Maps\"",

I notice that one of the graphs has the states separated by their electoral votes, while the other one is a typical electoral map with each state colorized. I notice that the number of electoral votes is very disproportionate to the size of the state. I wonder how this electoral map compares to those in the past, such as the 1984 electoral map. I wonder how voting in the states compares to that of the 2016 election between Trump and Clinton. This topic has an impact on our community because it represents the results of the presidential election and possibly how each state or region might react to the new regulations and decisions made by our President Biden. The electoral map and who each electorate votes for has an impact on our community because it has the opportunity to elect our president for the next 4 years. The impact on my community these graphs have is that federal laws are now going to be coming from a Democratic (vs Republican) head of state, which means that many social issues and environmental issues will be decided differently.

The first map's set up represent the electoral vote each state has and how 2 states such as Nebraska and Main divide their vote between 2 candidates.

In both Maine and Nebraska, it was their second district, but for different parties. Maine's 2nd district contains a majority of their rural land (accounting for their red vote) whilst Nebraska's second district contains Omaha, the largest city in the state (accounting for the blue vote).\n\nWhat do you wonder: Is the electoral system really fair in its current state? Is it fair at all? Does it make sense that land should have a higher say in the leadership of the nation? In a nation as large and with needs as separate as ours, does it make sense to perpetuate the system which sees the election of one national figurehead? A state could have a near perfectly split popular vote yet those few votes could decide the entire say of that given state. \n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community: This map really hammers home the importance of voting and making our voices be heard. As a community, we HAVE to make our opinions known to the national stage and the most surefire way to do so is to vote. \n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph: This graph shows the shifting opinions of the nation since the last election and displays the various wants and needs of the people who voted in their respective regions. A potential headline could be: \"Separate Needs, Seperate Worlds: A nation fragmented\".",

The top one, which I believe is a better map, shows the electoral votes that each state has, as well as who had more votes in that state, whereas the bottom map only shows who had more votes in each state, with no depiction of how many electoral votes each state has. I wonder why most maps that I see don't show the electoral votes, but only the states, like the bottom map. I feel that the top map is a much better depiction of who is currently winning the election. These maps impact me and my community because I feel like a lot of times, kids that are my age can't really fathom what the electoral college is, so the top map really gives people my age a good idea of what the electoral college is and how it works. For instance, when I was talking to one of my friends about the election, they said that if there wasn't a bar on the top of the map showing who was winning, they would think that the Republican was winning, although, in reality, it's the Democrat. A heading for the top map could be \"Election Results by Electoral Vote\", and a heading for the bottom map could be \"Election Results by States' Popular Vote\". In conclusion, I feel that the top map gives people a better idea of not only how the electoral college works, but who is truly winning the election, and why, even though the Republican had more states' popular vote, the Democrat actually was winning.",

This is because the blue states have more electoral votes and their  vote has a larger say in the total vote. For example, even though California is one state, it has 55 electoral votes. Contrastingly, Alaska only has 3. This is because California has a much larger population than Alaska. The states that Biden won have larger populations and therefore more electoral votes.

By spreading the states apart and adjusting the sizes, the map reads in a way that Biden has a more dominant lead over Trump. The states are sized in this specific way to show the number of electoral votes each state has, so although they maybe are shaped like their formation, there is no true correlation to their size. By having the states all connect in the second graph, it appears as if Trump maintains the lead. However, this has no true correspondence with a population per state. \n\n2. I primarily wonder why maps such as the first one are not used as much in mass media. This is because the first map thoroughly describes the true votes based on electors and such. When using the map that shows electoral votes, it is viewed as more accurate. \n\n3. This impacts me and my community because it shows how despite being a small state, we have very similar amounts of electoral votes when compared to other larger states. This only proves how important the population plays a role in voting.\n\n4. The first map breaks down the electoral votes per each state and which way they swayed and the second map depicts the states based on their regular size without mentioning electoral votes, and also shows which way they swayed.

If you have identify with the Republican Party but live in CA (and other examples like that), do some voters not even vote because they know their vote won't be heard? Even people who are in the middle of the political spectrum and aren't sure who to vote for may not vote if they live in a state that is heavily republican or democrat.\n\nThis impacts my community and I because the winner of the election, Joe Biden, will lead our country for the next four, potentially eight, years.

For example, Alaska is clearly larger than New Hampshire, however, on the first map, New Hampshire has one more electoral vote compared to Alaska. This clearly depicts how the electoral votes are determined by population size, rather than landmass. I notice that though the states on the second map look more like a typical geographic map when you count the states it seems like Donald Trump is winning the election. If a viewer does not see the electoral vote count at the top of the map, they might believe incorrectly believe that Donald Trump is winning the election, which is not true. \nI wonder why news castings and websites do not typically show the first map. The first map makes a clear distinction about who was winning based. The second map can be misleading because people tend to look at the map and judge the winner based on the area that each color takes up.\nThis impacts my community because though we have a Republican governor, we still elected Joe Biden as a whole. This shows how we elect our representatives based on opinion on policies and promises instead of on what party each candidate is from.\n When looking at the first map, you can clearly see the length of Joe Biden\u2019s victory. The second map is misleading because it seems that Donald Trump is winning the election, whereas the truth is quite the opposite. A catchy headline may be, \u201cPopulations vs. Area\u201d",

So even though Biden won, the second map can deceive some by the looks.\n2) I always wondered why some states time and time again strictly just vote for one party. In my opinion, every state should be a swing state or just vote for the obviously better-fit person to lead the country. I also wonder why there aren\u2019t more colors seen on the maps. Third parties aren\u2019t even given a chance since everyone is forced to pick a side just to see the other party not win. Almost every election time the map for the most part looks like the second one, and I believe people would benefit more to gain a better understanding by looking at the first map.\n\t3)While the majority of people in a country mostly get to elect their leader, there will always be the people who are in the minority who just won't accept that most people don\u2019t support their opinion. This can create a division among people and communities when about 55-60% of votes go towards the majority, but then leaving those 40-45% of people either upset or feel as if it should\u2019ve gone their way.

I think It could be very easy for someone to look at the second map and assume Trump won.\nI wonder what compels a state to divide its electoral votes between parties such as Maine and Nebraska? And why do most states not do this instead?\nThis has a surprising impact on my community mostly due to the fact that New Hampshire can often be a very red state, however in this instance it is blue.

I believe this system would really work out well because if done fairly, most people in a state would have some say on where their vote goes and doesn't completely block out the minority. It would definitely be more lenient towards the popular vote which is a good thing. Hopefully, it would be from gerrymandering and other corrupt tactics.",

The first values data over looks, specifically, it shows the number of electoral votes for each state instead of the correct shape and cleanliness of the state.  The second graph takes a more traditional approach, and shades states in with whichever color it sided with.  I\u2019m interested in the first graph since it takes an unorthodox approach to presenting the information.  \nSince electoral votes are based on the population of a state, I wonder if each vote is directly proportional to a percentage of the state.  For example, if one of New Hampshire\u2019s votes represents more or less people than say for one of California\u2019s votes.  \nSince we live in a relatively small state with a low population, I\u2019m not surprised with our electoral college votes compared to our state size.  It appears that we are on the lower end of states when considering electoral college votes, but that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing.\nSince the first graph appears to present data more accurately, I would question the authenticity or effectiveness of the second graph in a title comparing the two.

Is there something more for those states are not as urban or populated as others will always vote for the republican party?\n3.This has an impact on the state of Ohio for those who choose the vote for the republican party.

We have seen states like California with the highest populations going overwhelmingly blue that contain massive cities like Los Angeles or New York. Both of these states vote blue by a longshot and are both coastal states. States like Washington, Oregon, and New Jersey are also densely populated areas on coastal areas that tend to vote blue. However, two states with large populations, Texas and Florida voted red this election. What I found interesting was that the democrats were able to win states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Georgia which were previously red. This made me wonder why these states went blue this election, whether COVID played a role, and what the democrats did that the republicans did not.\n\n2.) What are some policies that encapsulate densely populated areas and shift these communities to vote blue?  The Midwest does not nearly make as much of the population up as these cities, yet makes 2/3 of the land and tends to be mostly red. Where does this polarization between densely populated and rural areas spur from?\n\n3.)

There are many factors that led to its flip, one of them being a change in voter demographics. Young black voters in particular overwhelmingly showed support for Biden. Another is that people in the highly populated city of Atlanta favored Biden, whereas there were less people supporting Trump in the rural counties.",

But, on the Electoral College votes winner-map, we are able to see the distribution of votes is not always overwhelmingly for one candidate. We are able to see in Nebraska and Maine there is one small box in the state that actually went the other way (in Nebraska it went blue, in Maine it went red). This displays clearly the idea of winner-takes-all in most American states, outside of the very few exceptions like Nebraska and Maine, who stand out for not having just one color or another.\n2. I wonder if it is likely that the first map could be used more often if the Electoral System was either abolished or strongly reformed. Each state would then have a chance to have different winners per \"block\" in their state, possibly giving way to more diverse opinions and a more fair system of voting in president. I also wonder why states in the mid-West so strongly associate with Trump, even though many of Trump's policies hurt working-class men and women. In many of these states, the very people voting for Trump are most likely negatively affected by his politics. \n3. Once again, Ohio went red during this election.

The map also gives a representation of each size of the state (by population), which is how the electoral map is counted... \n\n2. What would the map look like if you put all the block states together like the United States? How would it compare in size to the actual map? \n\n3. The impact this has on my community is that even though our community (Lakewood) tends to be more Democrat, Ohio as a whole is red (Republican), this is mostly due to rural areas in Ohio. So basically, our community is just one piece of the puzzle within a puzzle piece. \n\n4. Besides the graph representing that Joe Biden won the election, it also represents the true population size of these states, especially states that are big in size, but small in population (like Alaska and the Dakotas). A Catchy title could be \"What would the United States look like as if they were sized down to represent population\"",

The first map shows the votes within each specific state based off of the color changes in the states this tells us where the most votes for the candidates was given within each state, and it shows that there are more blue votes, because it shows population density whereas the second map only shows the states as a whole, and the only difference we can tell is that they are all shaded differently based off of the amount of people who voted blue or red, which makes it seem like red won because it doesn't take into account of population density.\nI wonder why the American people generally use the second map because the first map seems to be more accurate.\nThe impact this has on me and my community is that the second map is misleading, and not as accurate, which can cause confusion within the country about which candidate actually won the election.\nThe second graph doesn't show population density, headline idea \"America Divided: So Which Candidate Won?\"",

Whereas the bottom graph is showing more of an \"overall\" outcome rather than breaking it down. For example, in the top graph Nebraska was primarily republican, but it also shows the small section that voted for Biden. \n\nWonder - I wonder if having these two graphs somewhat helped people understand the outcomes of this election if they were apart of the group that essentially were weary of the winner. \n\nImpact - This graph ultimately shows that in a time of need, people will rise to vote and further better their country for the future. Over the past four years people have seen what our government has done and have decided what need to happen next and have selected a candidate who will support them. \n\nGoing On - In each of these graphs, we are being shown which states were won by the election candidates whether it was for the republican party or the democratic. The difference is that the top half is showing each states broken down to the size of their electoral votes. Catchy Title \"The Distorted Divide\"",

Very large states where no one lives in them are small and inconsequential on this map. Secondly both maps are deceiving especially the above one. Since the above map looks like it's divided into districts it appears as if all districts went a certain way. Thirdly This above map makes the United States look more balanced. On the original map it seems like 70% of the country is red. The new map makes the country look more 50/50.\n\nI wonder if moves will be made by either party to get their people to live in opposite states or districts to try and flip them.\n\nIt means that Lakewood Ohio is the blue bubble in a sea of red. This is due to gerrymandering and a stacked republican state government.\n\nThe thing with this graph is it is showing a more reflective map of the country. \"The Political Landscape of the Real America\" This is my tagline and it is epic.",

The first map gives you more of an idea of how many electoral votes each state got. The states are divided almost into sections. The states on the East and West coast are mostly Democratic and the mid states tend to be more Republican. I wonder what percent of the population each state voted and it would be nice to show the overall population of each state as well. I live in a predominately democratic city, making it unfortunate for my city that my state is red. This discouraged a lot of people in my area. However, Joe Biden still won the overall vote. As for a catchy headline, I would recommend \"Maps of Perhaps the Most Controversial U.S. Presidential Election\"",

Some few states are different color because at first they were voting for red then when they finished there was more votes for blue. There is more red but the states that are blue are worth more electoral votes. The impact in this is that some presidents make changed over racism and they thinks its don't good but its really not doing any difference just making things worse.",

    "comment info": "The graph is showing the results of the 2020 election. I wonder how the few states left managed to go blue when we all thought they would be red. This impacts me because it is the president of our country. The president runs our whole country and can try to pass certain laws. These laws can affect me and others in a positive or negative way. In the graph, it shows which states voted republican and which voted democrat. I think a catchy headline for this graph can be \"The DIvide Between Americans\" or \"A Divided America.\" I think this is catchy because it may make people wonder what the divide is. I think it's really interesting how around 50% of our country thinks one way and the other 50% thinks another. I also am so happy that this election has gotten the most amount of people to vote.",

I wonder why electoral votes are what is counted, rather than popular votes. The winner of the election has an impact on my community because there are plans from one candidate on taking away certain minority rights, which effects my friends and family.  A catchy headline would be \"Americas Future\".",

I don't wonder anything. The presidents have two very different visions of what to do with the country and they will affect my community a lot. I would make the headline electoral graph for the election.",

I wonder if the amount of squares that makes up each state is the amount of electoral votes the state is worth. The impact this has is that it shows how divided our country is, especially considering how polarized the parties are now. The headline would be \"Significance of the States\"",
