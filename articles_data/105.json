I has the pre-conception that higher elevation wind turbines do better.

California, more specifically, is going all electric vehicles by 2035. How will this electricity be supplied?

The map on the right demonstrates the ammount of solar and wind energy being acquired around the united states. The goal of the United States is to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 which means all the carbon dioxide produced will cancel out and not be added to the atmosphere. The right map shows what the production should look like if the net-zero is to be reached with the current projections in energy consumption. This map is only utilizing wind and solar energy however which are the most common sources of renewable energy but it does leave out hydropower along with nuclear energy. I believe that in order for the United States to be able to achieve the net-zero by 2050 nuclear energy must be heavily utilized as it is the most efficient with the least bi-product with the only two needed resources being processed uranium and water.

It's somewhat surprising because these states are less \"busy\"/populated, and possibly do not emit fossil fuels compared to more populous states. Could the mid-region be less populated, and have excess land for wind turbines and solar panels (excluding solar-powered homes)? The coasts of the US present a different interest for wind power and alternatives for power in general. For example, although they display a higher solar footprint, there do not seem to be many homes/places that utilize solar panels/solar energy. I've always considered San Diego a unique place because there are solar panels on the roofs of almost every home. It's still not enough to produce change.

This means that for green power production to truly be effective we must build a large amount of infrastructure (mainly in the form of long range power lines and transformer stations) to transport the electricity form where it is being generated and where it is needed. This could cause problems for the implementation of clean energy if not addressed. I wonder what the chart for projected green energy production by 2050 across the U.S. would look like rather than the chart for needed power production to reach net zero, and if the charts would look at all alike.

I also noticed that there needs to be much more growth in terms of wind than solar power. \nI wonder is if this goal is even realistic. Looking at the growth needed vs the growth that has already happened we need to be moving much faster in order to reach that goal. Perhaps a compromise is in order or maybe even consideration of alternative power sources like nuclear or hydro power for example. Yet another worry is whether or not this solution is cost effective or even particularly environmentally conscious. Solar panels last on average 25-30 years and they contain hazardous waste such as lead and cadmium. Wind turbine blades are generally made out of fiberglass which is not biodegradable. They only last up to 25 years and cannot be recycled. What do we plan on doing with all of this hazardous or non biodegradable waste that will inevitably be created? \nInterestingly Hawaii is not featured in this study. However I believe that Hawaii has committed to a plan to become completely carbon neutral by 2045.

I wonder why there are some clusters in the northeast, but barely any in the west. Also, is there a correlation between farmland/the farming industry and the needed wind and solar power?\n\n3.

If you set up a wind farm, while it might be expensive, it could power energy for a whole neighborhood. The opposite goes for solar panels as each individual roof would need a panel.

Right from the bat I notice just how much more power we need. The two maps show a very little amount versus a large amount. \nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder where this map got the statistic that proves how much we need by the year 2050?

This relates to me because solar and wind energy are crucial to delaying the already inevitable global warming and since I am only in high school I will be on this earth much longer. I would name this \" Clean energy needed by 2050\"",

In order to reach net-zero in 2050, the amount of wind and energy sources needs to increase substantially. I noticed that by 2050 the amount of solar energy in the eastern side of the country needs to increase.  By 2050, there needs to be more energy in the eastern side of the country.  This might be due to the weather in the east.  Winds are stronger in the east.  I wonder why there is not an increase in 2050 in western states like California.  Since California has sunny weather wouldn't it be reasonable to place solar power stations were sun is available.

We discussed the benefits and disadvantages of fossil fuels, and this graph shows the country looking for better ways to get energy. Fossil fuels are non renewable, but wind and solar energy are renewable. \n\nWe noticed: In the 2050 map: there is more orange in the east than west; the center of the country has mainly wind, with solar on the coasts; there will be wind energy off the coasts. Hawaii and Alaska are not included in either map. \n\nWe wonder: How much fossil fuel will we still use in this net zero scenario? Why won\u2019t there be more solar energy? How will wind energy work on the ocean? What will be the side effects of these changes? Why are we still relying so much on fossil fuels? \n\nThe connection to our community:\nIn north Louisiana, there are not currently any wind or solar sources, and in 2050, Louisiana is not going to get much more than it has now. Does fewer sites in our state mean we will still be using fossil fuels, or will we get our energy from other states? Why doesn\u2019t the 2050 map show more windfarms off our coast?

There are few sparse areas of wind coverage, especially in the middle of the country. I wonder why there is more wind coverage in the Midwest than in any other area. My guess for the answer to this question would be because wind coverage is usually placed at the tops of rounded hills, open plains, and gaps in mountains. Therefore, the middle of the country has far more open rural areas in the midwest than either coast.

I think there is lots of sun in the Alabama-Georgia-South Carolina-Florida and California area, but as we get into the 13 colonies, I am unsure if this plan will work the way it should. The Midwest is where wind is going to be highly depended on. It has less mountainous terrain and random inclines and declines, making an ideal spot to have more and more collection for wind. \nQ2. I wonder how costly this will be. What we currently have is less than a sixth of the projected amount that we need. Are we going to be able to hit the goal by 2050? Can we build these farms and stay carbon zero? Are there any plans to use hydroelectricity, something that perhaps Hawaii or Alaska can do to help the country be carbon zero?\nQ3. Since I live in Hawaii, it does not cover our state. However, we are putting in effort in our community to have solar and wind power. My neighborhood has about 7 homes that run on solar power and I know that I see 40+ homes with solar power on the drive out of my valley. We may not all be thinking about the environment and being carbon zero, but with the solar initiative, we are able to have a cleaner Hawaii.

I notice that now we have very little solar power anywhere, and very little wind power in the mid-areas. we need a lot more solar power than wind power in the areas near the coast, on the far west and far east, but in the mid-areas, we need a lot more wind power. I wonder what we can to do achieve this, and how much money it will take because this will be very costly to the U.S. I wonder why we need more wind power in the mid-areas, and why we need more solar in the coastal areas.       \n\nPossible Title\nWind and Energy, Costly and Timely.",

    "comment info": "Title: \"The Strive for Sustainable Energy\"\n\nI notice that the places that already have solar and wind energy are the main ones that are aiming to grow by 2050. These are also the more flat areas of the United States, unlike areas such as Washington and Oregon that are more mountainous and have rocky landscapes. What I find interesting is that there is an area around the Rocky Mountains where there is less of a need but in the area around the Appalachian Mountains there is not. I wonder if this is because the Rockies are windier compared to the Appalachians so they already have all of it they need or if there just is no need for it around that area. I also notice that the most concentrated areas are in central and the northeast (around New England) and not in the west which surprises me due to the difference in population in places like Nevada with Las Vegas and California with Los Angeles. One thing I wonder is why there are some areas that are off the map that are shown to need the wind and solar power. Is this for fishing purposes? Or is it for something like powering off-land structures such as oil extracting sites or even lighthouses in those areas? I also wonder what the steps are that the nation is planning on taking to reach these goals and if there is any way that I can take part in helping it become a reality especially as I become older.",

By 2050 we will have to do a lot of work to get people to start using things by means of solar and wind energy. By 2050 we will need the middle of the country to have much more solar energy. This is the area where we need it the most. We need more solar energy in California, and in the South East. I can tell just by looking at it that we are not even close to achieving our goal, so everyone has to work really hard to get it.\n\nI wonder if it is possible. I really hope it is because if we can't do it we are toast. Especially in places like California and the South East we are nowhere close to achieving our goals for solar energy, and I don't know if we can unless everyone tries. Currently, we have just passed the 50% mark of people believing in global warming, and if we can't get that to 100%, we are going to have some problems on our planet.\n\nThis relates to me and my community because in New Hampshire we need much more solar and wind energy.

Eliminating so many plants that provide power to people and trying to replace them with solar panels and wind turbines would require more than \"a lot more\" panels and turbines. Solar panels and wind turbines do not last forever. Solar panels have a lifespan of about 25 to 30 years, and wind turbine have a lifespan of about 20 years. This means that we would have to replace ALL the solar panels and wind turbines at most every 30 years. These things are not cheap to produce, and making solar panels requires a huge increase in global mining mining (https://www.manhattan-institute.org/mines-minerals-and-green-energy-reality-check). So these \"renewables\" aren't so renewable after all. Plus they don't get the job done. We saw from afar last winter as people were left without power in a blizzard due to unreliable solar and wind energy. California had rolling blackouts due to not having enough energy available for everyone.\nI want numbers on this graph. I want to know how much land we are devoting to this unreliable, expensive, dream. On the other hand, it probably won't happen. People will wake up to the reality that this doesn't work, and any republican president, who will like directly replace Biden, seeing as his approval rating is falling fast, won't let this happen. I'm running out of room here, so I won't get too far into the reasons why they want this to happen. I'll leave you with this thought. The climate changes. It happens. it's normal.",

It looks like we need about ten times the number of wind farms we currently have in the next 29 years if we are to meet the net-zero emissions goal.  The 2050 map also has a lot more wind than solar farms. It shows that we will need to expand wind farms into the ocean areas off the coasts of many northeastern states, as well as a some southern and northwestern states.  This may not be very well-received by the people who live there.  Those places are know for their tourism and they might be worried that the wind farms will be ugly and affect whether people want to come to their beaches. I wonder how the Princeton Net-Zero American study determined where to put the new wind and solar farms.  Right now there is only a small amount of land in Iowa where there are wind farms.  The net-zero map would require about 3/4 of Iowa to be covered in wind farms.  Right now the windmills can be in farm fields and don't reduce the amount of land that can be farmed.  But with so many more windmills would Iowa lose farmland?  This could be a problem for the whole U.S. because we grow a lot of feed corn that is used around the country.

Specifically in the central areas, there is a huge contrast between the present footprint of wind power and what\u2019s needed in the future. This also means a huge amount of work is expected to reach the goal. Most of needed solar power in the future is more likely to be concentrated in the south along the coastal line.\nThe contrast between two chosen colours is undesirable because it gives a false impression on the scale(as if we need more wind power due to its stronger colour, whereas statistically it might be false). So I wonder if my observation is actually correct. Besides, I wonder if there is a linear scale in the amount of wind & solar power which should be built every year. For example, we will ever achieve the goal only if we manage to build 500000 energy systems every year? Less is dangerous? Can we downscale the number of solar and wind power and replace it with nuclear power, which is more efficient?\nI am not a US citizen, but we all know that how big countries deal and achieve climate goals can set a huge impact on other regions/countries in the world. Some small countries can build up their solutions and try to get prepared on its own.

Solar panels are used in a lot of places and windmills are used in certain places. I also wonder how much it would cost to get solar and wind by 2050? This doesn't really relate to me and my community but I'm certain we would need more solar and windmills close in case this happens. What's going on in the graph? All I see is dots in certain places that will need wind and solar. Today I can see that some places actually need wind already.",

This drastic difference is best seen in the wind footprint in the center of the US and the solar footprint across the east coast. \n\nOne of the biggest wonders I have is why is there so much focus on wind and solar as the future of green power when they are the most inefficient and unreliable methods of power production with very little room for future improvement and development?\n\nThis relates to everyone including myself as finding a solution for climate change through changing the energy industry affects us all, and how we go about it is crucial to our planets future.\n\nA catchy headline for this graph would be \"Catching the wind and sun for a better future\".",

It's pretty fascinating because a significant portion of the states that these energy suppliers run through aren't exactly known for being super friendly to the idea of sources of energy other than coal and fossil fuels. Meanwhile, states that have been notorious for being more friendly and have said they will try to begin to facilitate the transition such as California, Oregon, and Maine are lacking in terms of actual Wind and Solar footprint. I also wonder where all of the energy coming from wind farms in suburban Oklahoma goes to. There can't possibly be a need for that kind of electricity in a random suburb of Kansas. Where does the energy go?\n\nI would title this graph footprints made and the many steps left to take.",

I\u2019m wondering if this has something to do with the environments in these different regions and what would best fit the climates. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to use more solar energy in an area that doesn\u2019t get a lot of son.

I wonder also what a map of the wind and solar footprint by 2050 on the trajectory we are now. Would things barely change from today, or are we on the right path? I also wonder what other countries would have to do. Lastly, I also know how CO2 is also emptied by livestock, and so I wonder if we would also need other combined efforts.
