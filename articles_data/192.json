Before 1980 the number of high and low winter temperatures was relatively even compared to the 20th century average but after there are significantly more highs and significantly less lows. There was also a very extreme low temperature recorded in 1979 that was the lowest in the 20th century. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder how this data compares to data from other countries; does the trend vary across the world? I also wonder how this data changes across the U.S and how different areas are changing. In 1979 the U.S as a whole experienced a very low temperature and I wonder what (if anything) caused this low temperature and if it was predicted. I would also like to know how the data was recorded to know if it is reliable and what the average is. I wonder also how this data compared to the data from the polar vortex this winter and if the data predicted this or if it's unprecedented. Lastly, I would like to know how the temperatures of winters in the 20th century compare to the average temperature of the previous century because comparing them to the average of that century does not tell us much about how the temperatures changed in the 20th century \n\nWhat might be going on?\nI think this graph shows how drastic the rate of climate change is in the 21st century. It shows how rapidly the winter temperatures in the US increased most likely due to change in lifestyle",

This graph proves that the earth is warming up, and therefore global warming has occurred, and will continue to occur until we change our ways and become better citizens. As you can see we have had no \"icy blue colouring' on the graph in 38 years! This means the polar bears are dying and the icebergs are melting. This graph supports my claim that global warming is real and is ruining the earth. The data shows us that there is a balanced temperature up until the 1980's.

The temperatures in red could possibly be showing an increase in average temperatures and the blue temperatures could be showing a decrease in overall temperatures during exclusively the winter months. From my statistics class, I know we analyze a graphs shape, center, and spread. The shape of the red bars looks to be slightly skewed left and the blue bars look slightly skewed right., with one major outlier in the blue. The center (expected value) of the blue bars looks to be about -2 and the center of the red bars looks to be about 2. The red has a much higher spread and likely a higher standard deviation compared to the blues increased density and likely skewed standard deviation due to the single outlier near 1980.\n2)I wonder what is the possible cause of the continuous increasing through recent years? \n3) Caption- American winter temperatures- are they getting warmer?",

But, it isn\u2019t a bar graph.  Because the statistics are displayed on a 1900 \u2013 2018 timeline, it is more like a time series graph.  But, not quite.  Time series graphs typically have points and not bars.  So, it\u2019s not really a time series graph either.  \nThough we learn in math class that there are specific graphs, like bar graphs, histograms, scatter plots, and time series, statisticians are designing new kinds of graphs all of the time.  Why?  Because they want to present the statistics in the way that most clearly displays the relationships of the statistics. \n\nTomorrow, look at The Reveal which is posted at the bottom of today's release.  One of the additional questions, explain how to take the statistics in this graph and make it into a histogram.  When you do this, you can describe the graph's center, shape, spread, and unusual data points.  Maybe you can share with us what you discover.",

In the early 1900s on through the 1930s, there are large clusters of much cooler average temperatures, but it is the opposite from 1980 and on.\nWe think this because more CO2 emitted from factories and cars starting in the 1940s and China/India have since industrialized. There has been a lack in many CO2 regulations until recently.\nWe wonder: What caused the very cold winters of the early 1900s to 1930s? Why was there a large drop in average winter temperatures in the late 1970s? Why was there such a drastic turnaround from those much cooler temperatures to much warmer temperatures after that (which still continues today)?\nWe have learned from this graph that winters were once much colder on average than they are today, and there was a large drop in average winter temperatures in the late 1970s followed by a wave of a large increase in average winter temperatures, a wave we are still riding today.\nPotential Headline: \"Make Winters Cold Again\"",

Because of this, I'm curious if an increase in air pollution, carbon dioxide, and deforestation is responsible for the overall increase of winter temperatures on Earth. This graph could capture how pollution and an increase of carbon dioxide within the atmosphere  because the gas prevents small bits of heat from the sun from escaping the Earth's atmosphere, forcing it to bounce back to the Earth's surface as more thermal energy from the sun reaches our planet. A similar phenomenon has been present on Venus, which, due to the gases within Venus' atmosphere capturing the majority of thermal energy from the sun, has made Venus the hottest planet in the Solar System.",

After further research it appears that this strong outlier was the \"Brutal Winter of 1978-1979\".

At what specific hour was the reading taken, and could taking a temperature at a different hour while using the same data calculation, would it result in a different trend? \n\nThe story this graph tells is the trend of average winter temperatures since about 1900, specifically on how it is seeming to, over time, more consistently lie above the 20th century winter average.\n\nA cool headline for this graph could be \"Fire and Ice... then Fire again!\"",

Because the statistics are displayed on a 1900 \u2013 2018 timeline, it is more like a time series graph.  But, not quite.  Time series graphs typically have points and not bars.  So, it\u2019s not really a time series graph either.  \nThough we learn in math class that there are specific graphs, like bar graphs, histograms, scatter plots, and time series, statisticians are designing new kinds of graphs all of the time.
