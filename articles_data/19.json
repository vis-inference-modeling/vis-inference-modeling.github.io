On the other hand, women in the basketball and baseball field make less than $200K, showing a very distant outlier when comparing these two graphs.

I noticed that the left side of the graph, with only four sports, conveys far greater earnings than any sports listed on the right-hand graph. I was surprised that women's sports were pretty concentrated near the top on the right-hand graph. I was really happy to see this, as I have always felt like female sports don't usually get the love that they deserve. On a similar note, I found it interesting that women's basketball was on the left-hand of the graph (earning a much higher amount). While it is still significantly lower than men's basketball, it is a very high earning for a college athlete, and I was unaware that their earnings were so much higher than that of a majority of men's college sports like track or ice hockey.\n    2. I wonder why men's soccer is so low. Every time the World Cup comes around, the world becomes infatuated with male soccer players such as Messi or Ronaldo. For that reason, I find it surprising that men's soccer at the college level is relatively unpopular. \n    3. This relates to me as a senior in high school because while I am not personally an athlete, I have a lot of classmates and peers announcing their commitments to further their athletic careers in their college endeavors.

One big thing that I notice is that sports that are also played on a professional level, like football and basketball, they tend to make so much more than the other sports below them. I assume that this is because most college athletes do want to go on and play at these higher levels. I can also make the assumption that these sports make more because they're more popular in the entertainment industry. This is also very well seen where it says \"Men and women's track saw in increase after getting exposure in the Olympics,\" which is pretty much the ultimate sports competition and centers of entertainment.\n    I wonder if this graph would differ in other countries like Europe, where soccer is a more popular sport, where would soccer stand on this graph (If this graph's statistics are taken from American colleges of course.)\n    This can connect to the community because sports is one of the biggest entertainment industries in America.

The highest-paying major sport is men's basketball, at over $600,000, while the highest-paying nonrevenue sport is men's golf, at just over $20,000. I also noticed that while women's and men's basketball are both major sports, women get paid over $500,000 less than men. This shows that the gender pay gap is also relevant to college sports. The final thing I noticed is that women's and men's track/cross-country pay increased because of the Olympics. \n    \n    What do you wonder?\n    I wonder why some sports have higher pay for men than others for women. Why is the gap between major and nonrevenue sports so extreme? Are these earnings based on media attention? Why didn't any other sports, such as women's gymnastics, increase pay after the Olympics life track/cross country? \n    \n    How does this relate to you and your community?\n    This relates to me and my community because my friends and I all play sports, and I know some of them want to play in college.

Men's and women's track and field are highlighted in red, signifying their increasing earnings because of their media exposure during the recent Olympics.  I wonder what other nonrevenue sports received more media exposure at the recent Olympic games, and what sports will see large increases in expected earnings in future events like the Olympics.  I wonder why men's basketball makes so much more money than women's basketball, and if possible added exposure to women's basketball can help even out the average earnings between the two.

In contrast, on the non-revenue side, men\u2019s golf stands out as the highest-earning non-revenue sport, even though it doesn\u2019t generate nearly as much revenue as the major sports. Women's gymnastics earns much more than men\u2019s gymnastics, and men\u2019s and women\u2019s track and cross-country sports are on the rise in earnings, largely due to increased exposure from the Olympics. Fencing, on the other hand, generates the least revenue of all the sports listed. I wonder why softball, which is often considered the counterpart to baseball, is classified as a non-revenue sport while baseball is a major sport. I also wonder how the earnings of these sports have changed over time and if the financial gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s sports will continue to persist as women\u2019s sports gain more exposure.

I also notice that men's college basketball earns much more than women's. Similar to how, on the non-revenue side, women's gymnastic earns much more than men's. Furthermore, I notice that the non-revenue sports, even the highest paying ones, earn a fraction of what athletes of major sports earn. \n    I wonder why softball is on the non-revenue side when baseball, its counterpart, is a major sport. I wonder what this graph would've looked like in the past. I also wonder why men's golf makes such a high earning.\n    This relates to my community and I because college sports is very widespread and frequently watched, this graph gives us another perspective on the sports and athletes. Sports, at the end of the day, is a business and this graph gives insight into that aspect of it. \n    \"College Athletes: Is The Price Right?\"",

    "comment info": "In this graph comparing the earnings of nonrevenue and revenue college sports, I noticed a couple of huge differences. First, men's basketball earns an average of $600,000, which is 200x larger than the average earnings of fencing, which is around $3,000. Then, I also noticed the NAIA was only passed 5 years ago, meaning all of this money has shot up to rapid numbers in such a short period. Finally, I saw that women's basketball brings in almost $200,000 less than men's basketball; however, many women's sports on the nonrevenue side \"beat\" men's sports in earnings. I am curious what caused these earnings to skyrocket so quickly in the last five years, and what brings in the most money to these groups. I also wonder if any other sports will experience growth like track and field did because of the coverage from the Olympics (if so, what sport?). This relates to me because as a student-athlete I am surrounded by the environment of people committing to specific colleges, which comes with potential financial earnings. \n    Headline: The Rising Earnings of College Athletes",

Both men's and women's track and field had a large increase in expected earnings The highest-earning nonrevenue sport is men\u2019s golf with earnings of about $20,000.  The sports with the least earnings are fencing, rifle, men\u2019s volleyball, bowling, and rowing with earnings of less than $5,000. The major sport with the lowest earnings is baseball, and the major sport with the highest earnings is Men\u2019s basketball. \n    After looking at the graph I wonder why there is such a difference between earnings in men's and women\u2019s sports. What causes the increase or decrease in earnings for each sport? Why do major sports have higher earnings than nonrevenue sports? Why is there such a drastic difference in earnings for major sports?\n    This graph relates to my community because many students play and watch sports.

I also noticed that there are often significant gaps in the amount earned in men's and women's sports. Although men's sports seem like they make more money than women's, there are also sports where women make more than men, like volleyball and soccer. \n    2) I wonder why some men make more in some sports when women make more in others. What causes that to happen? Is it that some sports are seen as more 'feminine', and therefore are more popular amongst women, which makes them earn more? I also wonder what made track/cross country really shoot up. The graph says that it is because of the exposure from the Olympics, but wouldn't that mean that other sports get exposed too? Another thing I am wondering is why some sports don't have a gender specified, like wrestling, which doesn't specify.\n    3) This impacts me and my community because it could impact which sports somebody may choose to play. For instance, maybe they see this graph, and then decide that they will pursue basketball, because it makes more money. It also impacts my community because this is what the people in my community are earning when they are \"paid to play\".\n    4) Which sports do you get \"paid to play\" for?

The amount of sports making miniscule amounts is alarming, and I hope college athletes receive better/more sponsors to help them through their college journey. \n    I noticed the graph has no time scale which makes me wonder more.

In major sports, men's basketball players earn the most, averaging nearly $600,000, followed by football players with substantial but lower earnings. Women's basketball earnings are significantly lower than their male counterparts, and baseball players earn the least among major sports. In nonrevenue sports, men's golf leads in earnings, followed by women's gymnastics, while wrestling and both men's and women's track/cross country saw notable increases, attributed to Olympic exposure. However, earnings in nonrevenue sports remain significantly lower than in major sports, with the highest reaching around $20,000.\n    2)I wonder what factors contribute most to the earnings differences between sports. Is it primarily media exposure, sponsorship deals, or social media influence?\n    3) New Jersey has a strong sports culture, with major college athletic programs like Rutgers University and Seton Hall, where athletes may experience similar earning trends.
