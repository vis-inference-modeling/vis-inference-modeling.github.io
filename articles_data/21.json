Haiti is an interesting outlier that appears to have the highest level of all the countries examined in this graph. Further down, between 50% and 60% of the South Asian countries of India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan have a significant percentage of their young population that have been affected by lead poisoning. All the European countries examined and leading countries such as the US, China, and Russia seem to be at the lowest end of the graph indicating positive measures to avoid lead poisoning.\n\nWhat do I wonder?\nI'm wondering if conflict and poor infrastructure correlate to lead poisoning, as that seems to be a common factor among countries with the highest rates of lead levels in children. With the South Asian countries, I'm curious to see if the economic standing of a child in the country has to do with how prone they are to lead poisoning. With Europe especially, I'm wondering what systems they have in place that have allowed the continent to be on the lower end of this graph. I'm also wondering if these measures are easily adoptable in other countries or require significant funding. In Haiti, I'm wondering if the humanitarian crisis correlates to its situation.",

The size of each circle in the diagram represents the total child population in each country, so even though India has lower levels than other countries, it has one of the largest populations of affected children. The United States and countries in Europe have the lowest rates of elevated lead levels.\n\nThe graph says that data for most countries is from 2021. For which countries is it older? How accurate is the data? What are the policies in each region that impact children's lead exposure?\n\nThe graph depicts the United States as having the lowest percentage of children with blood lead levels at or above 5 micrograms per deciliter, with a rate very close to 0%. This shows that the regulations followed in the U.S. have helped reduce lead exposure in children, making it a prime example of environmental regulations that other countries should try to follow. Overall, the graph highlights the urgent need for an international effort to reduce lead contamination.

The data shows that lead poisoning is a bigger issue in African and Asian countries, with nations like Haiti, Yemen, and Afghanistan having over 80% of children affected by elevated lead levels. In contrast, European and North American countries, like the U.S., have significantly lower rates\u2014below 20%\u2014which shows a clear disparity.\n\nYour question about government responsibility is spot on. The second graph highlights how the U.S. reduced lead exposure after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) phased out leaded gasoline in the 1980s. By 2020, only 2% of children in the U.S. had high lead levels, compared to over 99% in the past. This suggests that strong government policies and regulations can have a major impact. In many African and Asian countries, weaker regulations, limited resources, and less funding for public health initiatives likely contribute to higher lead exposure. Countries with fewer regulations on industrial pollution or outdated infrastructure, like old lead pipes, face greater challenges in reducing exposure.\n\nIt\u2019s true that while many U.S. communities are safer now, lead poisoning still affects certain areas, especially in older cities with aging infrastructure or places like Flint, Michigan. But overall, the situation in the U.S. is much less severe compared to countries like Haiti or Yemen, where lack of resources and instability make addressing environmental health issues incredibly difficult.",

What do you notice?\n\nI notice that the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels is higher in countries like Haiti, Yemen, and Afghanistan, while countries like the United States and Russia have much lower rates. For example, over 80% of children in Haiti have elevated lead levels, compared to nearly 0% in the United States. Additionally, countries with larger populations of children, like India and Nigeria, also show concerning lead exposure rates.\n\n2.

In Africa, the purple bubbles and in the Middle East the orange bubbles have the highest lead percent found in children, being scattered throughout the graph, ranging from the bottom 30% to the top above 80%. In contrast, in Oceania the lime green bubbles, and in Europe the grey bubbles are found only at the bottom with the maximum lead percent being only 15%. In Asia, teal bubbles have a density of lead levels towards the middle ranging from 25% to 65%, particularly in the 40% to 60% range. Lastly, North America and South America are scattered in the mix found in the bottom range of 0% to 20% and then closer to the top in between 60% to 80%. \n\n2. What do you wonder?\n\nI wonder why blood lead levels are worse in some countries than others? Every country has a unique climate so some things may work in some countries to keep lead blood levels healthy while in another country it may not work. So how does the environment and climate play a role in high levels of lead in people's blood? Are people in countries with high percentages of lead in blood informed and concerned about this? Since this data is on children I wonder if genetics will be altered in the population of children growing up and developing having large exposure to lead?",

Europe is the only continent where all countries have a similar, low percentage of total population of children that have high levels of lead in their blood. On the other hand, the other continents have a wide variety of different percentages.\n \n2. What do you wonder?\nI wonder how Europe was able to keep their lead percentages so low, while other continents have a wide range of percentages.

This data is pretty recent, from 2021 by UNICEF, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund. \nOn the left of the graph, we have the y axis of this graph, which is the percentage of children in the country's total children population that has blood lead levels at or above 5 micrograms per deciliter. The higher the value is, the less healthy and more in danger the child's life is. The data is categorized by country. That is, each circle represents a country. The bigger the circle, the bigger the children population is of that country. For example, India has the biggest representing circle, which means the biggest children population in India than any other countries, dated by 2021. The data is also categorized by continent, with each continent represented by a different color. \nOne thing we can see from the graph is that Africa has diverse blood lead levels among their country's children population, with over half countries having 50% or more precentage, which represents the risk that African children are facing at large. This could be due to a lot of different reasons, mainly socioeconomic.

There is a large portion of incidence from countries in Africa, followed by the presence of countries in Asia. Higher levels are showing for countries in Africa and the Middle East, with the exception of Haiti at the highest levels (North America). The United States reports very low frequencies of elevated lead levels in children. \n\nWhat do I wonder? The data is a little confusing, in my opinion. The results are looking at children who present lead levels of 5mg or higher, but not the overall number of children; in other words, I think we do not see the number of children who do not have any levels of lead. What we also don't see is the percentage of children related to the whole population. For example, if a country has more children or less children, then the results would not be fully indicative for the whole population but mostly for children, which in itself is interesting information but cannot be generalized to the whole population. \n\nI would also like to see where these results are, related to time. Has this changed across time? Are we better or worse than prior years, what is the tendency?\n\nWhat can I infer: I could infer, but it may be flawed, that lower economies have higher frequencies and levels of lead levels.",

Does it have anything to do with location, or does it have to do with the stricter health regulations European countries have? This is extremely pertinent to my community because I am fortunate to live in a county with very low levels of blood lead levels, meaning it is an issue I am grateful to not have to necessarily worry about.

The variation is surprising.\nThis relates to me and my community because the graph focuses on children. I rarely see graphs only studying children and how things affect us. As a young teenager, this graph scares me because soon, our generation is going to take over as adults and we will be in charge. This will be a difficult job, especially because we will almost certainly have the problem of climate change dumped on us. Even if we were all raised being fed the healthiest food and with the kindest adults raising us, it would still be a lot for us to fix.

        "comment info": "Thanks for your thoughtful questions on our graphic.\n\nData is weak on this issue, particularly in the developing world and especially in countries like Haiti where security is an issue. I can imagine two kinds of bias: It may be that the people who got tested were disproportionately those suspected of lead exposure, elevating figures. Or it may be that those who got tested were disproportionately better off, perhaps reducing the numbers. We need more testing and better data.\n\nAs for how we can reduce the numbers in the U.S., most kids in America do okay -- but some have very high exposures. In Baltimore I met a small child who'd been permanently mentally disabled because of skyrocketing lead exposures, possibly because of a battery recycling operation that dumped car battery fluids with lead into the dirt where the child played.\n\nI see you're in Portland. One challenge in Oregon is that many kids are never tested for lead, so they could have exposures that no one is aware of. Other jurisdictions require all children to be tested. Your class might lobby for guidelines calling for all young Oregon children to be tested at least once or twice for lead -- just to make sure some kids aren't falling through the cracks.

The crisis exposed about 100,000 residents to lead \u2013 children and adults alike.
