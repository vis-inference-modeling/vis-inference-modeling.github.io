For example, only 30% of nutritionists think frozen yogurt is healthy, but 65% of all Americans think it is healthy. But, 90% of nutritionists think quinoa is healthy, but only 55% of all Americans think it is healthy. So, in this graph, the population and nutritionists have opposing opinions. \n\nI wonder why people have such different opinions than the nutritionists. Maybe because Americans grew up learning what was healthy and what wasn't, and they didn't really try to take a closer look at these foods. Nutritionists spend their time studying food to see what is healthy, so they have more experience about what is healthy. \n\nYou can infer from this graph that some of the foods Americans think are healthy aren't actually very healthy. Or, we think something is unhealthy when it is healthy. This graph goes beyond food because it shows that what we learn isn't always the truth.",

About 45% of Americans think sushi is healthy, but there's about 80% of nutritionists who think it is... that's 35% more. Also, there's a diagonal line running through the square.\nI wonder why Americans don't realize how quinoa and sushi are healthy because, using sushi as my example again, it's just seaweed, rice, fish, and maybe a vegetable (like avocado). It's not like those are usually counted as unhealthy. Also, I wonder what's up with Slimfast shakes. It's made to get people in shape, but it ends up just fattening them.\nI can infer that the diagonal line in the center is what they want everything to be on because that means people are aware of how healthy things are. This would represent a total understanding between Americans and nutritionists.",

As for the sushi i can kind of understand why because there is rice, seaweed and seafood (protein) but its almost off the chart like the quinoa.\u00a0\nThe story that the graph is telling is that most foods you would find healthy aren't really because its showing you the nutritionists perspective and what the Americans are saying. I can agree with this because i know that most of these foods like pizza, soda, fries and ice cream aren't to healthy and shouldn't be eaten on a daily bases like kale, chicken, avocado,\u00a0 almonds etc.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis just proves how unhealthy us Americans eat and that we should be eating the food at the top of the chart.",

Majority of Americans seem to think that things like frozen yogurt, steak, turkey etc. are healthy, though they are not, and are actually high in fats.\nI think this is because we don't know about everything that these foods are made from. We should eat everything,but in moderation, because these sorts of food could cause various illnesses, like obesity and cancer. the graph also says that wine, and popcorn is healthier than milk. But if wine is had only in moderation, it's okay. Popcorn has lots of butter, and corn which raises blood sugar levels.

According to the graph, a majority of Americans think that steak, turkey, peanut butter, beer etc. are healthy foods, but surprisingly they\u2019re not. A main reason is that we don\u2019t usually dive in the food making process and are unaware of how foods are made, we won\u2019t know if foods on our dish is filled with preservatives, or even gutter oil. This causes a lot of people to become obese, or even causes cancer. Even if we try to turn to healthier food like vegetables or low fat meat, we don\u2019t even know the vegetables got pesticides or the poultry got antibiotics.

It may not be entirely their fault as the food industry could be misleading them and duping them into believing the foods they eat are healthy, but in reality they are not.",

Percentages differ when the food item is placed above or below the dotted line.

I also wonder why any nutritionist would consider something like french fries healthy (even though it is less than 10% of nutritionists who say that). I could probably find the answer to this question by searching for nutritionist reviews of products that are generally seen as unhealthy. The story that this graph is telling is a lot of Americans are ignorant about personal health.

This implies that the people of America for the most part have received a good enough education about nutrition that they can distinguish among different types of food. However, this is somewhat puzzling because the USA ranks relatively poorly in life expectancy and spends the most money annually on health expenditures internationally by far. This makes me wonder what is causing this disconnect between what is known vs what actually occurs. I notice that this graph has a positive correlation as there is a positive slope. This shows, as pointed out before, that both categories of people indicate food in similar areas. However, it is strange that there are only 7-8 foods that seem to deviate from the line of best fit, which shows that the foods are mostly foods that Americans and nutritionists agree on, rather than foods that simply one group thinks is healthy/unhealthy when the other disagrees.",

Which proves that they can easily tell us fake information to brainwash us. Since \"good\" scientist are paid by the government, the government is controlling us causing a mass brainwash and the beginning of a communist country, the USA.

However, some foods that Americans think are unhealthy are actually deemed as healthy by nutritionists and vice versa. This implies that what nutritionists are saying is not getting through to most Americans and that we have many misconceptions about the healthiness of different foods.\n\nI wonder whether the information from this graph has even greater impacts that we do not see directly in the visual. For example, perhaps the graph shows how media has influenced our views on foods and given us the wrong ideas about what seems healthy to us and what is actually healthy according to nutritionists. If we were to pay more attention to the facts, we would be able to make healthier choices about what we eat. I also wonder if there is a reason for these specific foods to be shown on the graph. Are these the most popular foods bought by consumers in America, or perhaps something else entirely?\n\nIn the graph, there is a linear regression, showing that most foods are agreed on to an extent to be seen as healthy or unhealthy to both Americans and nutritionists. However, the foods that are not on top of this linear regression can be interpreted as misconceptions of the foods' healthiness. The deeper story to this graph may be that we have found a better way for people to diet and become healthier because when people may have thought they were eating healthily, they actually weren't",

When observing this graph, it is important to note that food above the line is healthier than most people think it is and that food below the line is unhealthier. This sample of Americans believes a lot of the unhealthier food to be healthier than it really is and visa versa. This may be due to the dietary habits of much of America.  I wonder how people were sampled to get this information. Based on your environment, your diet will vary so it is essential that we know more information about this sample. Also, I wonder WHY foods such as granola and coconut oil were deemed healthy by Americans. It is possible to find this information by taking a survey of the sample involved in this experiment. I believe this may be due to advertising. Based on this graph, we can tell that advertising is a huge part of public perception. I don't see sushi, tofu, and quinoa being advertised as much as yogurt and granola. The obesity rate for America ranged from 30-35%, and that percentage is also very similar to the percent of people that think some unhealthy food is actually good for you. This graph tells us that, in order to combat the issue plaguing America, we must change the public outlook on these matters, through the means of advertisement and more.",

Someone coming from a wealthy background can't be compared to someone with a poor background surrounding what is healthy to them.  I believe people have a perspective of what is healthy, but still have a sense that what they grew up with is essential healthier to them. Nutritionists have all the food they think are \"healthy\" at the top, but doesn't consider why these are healthy choice than the items at the bottom.

The pattern in this graph shows that when the nutritionists say a type of food is healthy and so do the Americans, the graph data increases at a higher rate. Also, this graph shows how nutritionists view food and how Americans view food.",

They should have used a bar graph to display this data.\nI wonder what made them decide that a line graph would be a good idea to show this data; it doesn't display change over time, so they shouldn't use a line graph.\nWhat's going on in this graph is they are attempting to show the contrast between what nutritionists say is healthy and what parents say is healthy. And the data is probably pretty accurate considering that the parents probably eat most, if not all of the same things their kids eat. But, nutritionists say otherwise. Also the foods aren't really in categories or anything so it makes it hard to categorize the graph.",

These foods include fruits, wheat instead of white breads, vegetables, nuts, and white meats. What is interesting to note is the smaller section of foods on the bottom right corner of the graph. These include granola, granola bars, coconut oil, and frozen yogurt. This section represents the foods which Americans perceive as being healthy/good for their well-being, but their supposed healthiness has been disputed by nutritionists.

Why are there different perceptions of the health of these foods when there seems to be agreement among many of the others?

Meanwhile, foods like quinoa are not marketed as often which may lead Americans to be unaware of their true nutritional merit.\n\nThe story this graph is telling is that, in general, Americans as a whole tend to agree with nutritionists when deeming foods healthy or not, yet there are certain groups of food in which nutritionists and Americans do not agree upon which could be a result of marketing.",

    "comment info": "Hello everyone, this graph shows healthy and unhealthy food according to nutritionists and Americans. They both agree on what is healthy but they disagree on some of the food, for example yogurt, or even butter which most people think is not healthy.  We wonder who was asked in the population and how and where, so demographics, which may affect the answers. So, we know that obesity is a problem in America, but also, thinking about our class, we know that even if we understand which foods are healthy, we often choose food based on taste alone.",

Why do a lot of Americans think that frozen yogurt is healthy but nutritionists do not?We think the graph is comparing how nutritionists think and how Americans think. How many Americans were surveyed to get this result?",

    "comment info": "Welcome to What\u2019s Going On in This Graph?.   Do you think you eat healthy foods?  Are you eating healthy?  Maybe these are not easy questions to answer.  Take a hard look at the graph.\nWhat do you NOTICE?  What this may imply?\nWhat do you WONDER?  Where could you find the answers to what you wonder?\nWhat\u2019s the STORY this graph tells?  Use what you notice.  What can you infer that is beyond what this graph shows directly?\nThe questions are intended to build on one another, so try to answer them in order. Start with \u201cI notice\u201d and then \u201cI wonder,\u201d and end with \u201cThe story this graph is telling is \u2026.\u201d\nAnd, your personal perspective may relate the graph not only to its statistics, but also science, history, literature, or somewhere else.\nThen, read what other students have to say.  Possibly, what they notice and wonder will lead you to other insights about the graph.  Press \"reply\" to respond to other comments.\n We look forward to reading your discoveries.",

    "comment info": "Period 1\nWe noticed that most of the foods that we like are on the bottom left and clearly unhealthy for us from both the nutritionist and american perspective.  It seemed like some of the foods were grouped together with things they go with. Americans feel that frozen yogurt & granola are healthy but the nutritionists don't seem to agree.\n\nWe wonder why the pork chop is shaped like a pig smoking a pink cigarette (for fun...but really it does).  Why did they choose the different food that they did and how did they arrive at the percentages?  \n\nWe feel that this graph is comparing the value of healthy foods from a nutritionist verses a regular person's point of view.  We feel it is showing us that some of the foods we think are healthy aren't necessarily healthy.",

Clearly my consumption decisions are not driven by healthy choices but personal favorites.\n\nI wonder if there is a, similar format, publicly visible at all eating establishments (dirty water dog cart -- Chez Paul) that might act as a subconscious influence on our eating habits slightly.",

Why is that? Because the nutritionists are less blind to the sugar/salt/fat content?\n\nI wonder how many Americans follow their knowledge and actually eat at the high end of the healthy scale vs. the low end.  Which particular Americans eat more healthy food \u2013 are there geographic or demographic correlations?\n\nI also wonder if the time of day determines at which end of the scale we are eating! Do we all start out the day in a healthy way and then slide down the graph into late-night pizza, cookies and ice cream, washed down with Coke?",

    "comment info": "I notice many foods are on the y=x line, meaning public and nutritionists as a whole have similar views on healtiness of a food. I also notice there is a distinct group of foods (frozen yogurt, granola, coconut oil) that has probably been successfully marketed to the public as healty, even though in reality, it isn't.\n\nOnly considering the y-component for now, I wonder why there are so many foods on which there is no consensus among nutritionists. A relatively large percentage of foods is considered healty by between 20% and 80% - meaning that you wouldn't find agreement on them among 5 nutritionists.\n\nI wonder if the disagreement among nutritionists stems from the vagueness of 'healty', the fact that some unhealty aspects of a food are subjectively weighed against the healty ones, and that only a yes/no verdict can be given.\n\nI'm not sure what this graph is telling. At first glance I thought it was 'public not that misinformed about healtiness of foods', or 'eat more from top right group, eat less from bottom left group', but it's also showing that opinions vary wildly when given only a binary option (healty / not healty) and that clear-cut advice can only be given for very few foods.",
