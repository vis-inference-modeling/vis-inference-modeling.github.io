I wonder why women tend to play for their state and not for their college and men tend to play for colleges more than for state. This could be due to more sports scholarships are possibly offered to men more than for women.

By analyzing the graph, it can be seen that a team can win any game against one another no matter their rankings coming into the tournament. Every game starts with the score of zero to zero and any outcome is possible by the end. It is wondered what the percent chances were of LSU winning the women\u2019s bracket and Connecticut winning the men\u2019s bracket before the tournament started. The wins definitely were not predicted by their seeding, but there was surely some percentage calibrated for whether or not they could possibly win the tournament. The tournaments really don\u2019t affect my community directly seeing as I am not closely affiliated with the college basketball world.

Additionally, I can see that starting in the round of 16, the women's bracket had an overall higher point total per game than the men's bracket. At the bottom of each bracket, I also observed the category stating the first four, which were placed separately from the bracket. I saw that Miami advanced to the quarterfinals in both the men's and women's competitions. The final game for the women received more votes than the final game for the men. The lower number of seeds typically ends up winning the matches, according to the overall graph. \n2. I wonder how the groups are made, is it based on the region in which the schools are located or based on the level of play that the team is capable of? What could be the main factor as to why the teams in the women's tournament scored more points compared to the men's tournament? Could it be different regulations that must be followed depending on gender? \n3. This relates to me and my community because many people enjoy watching March Madness whether they're basketball fans or not. In my community, basketball is one of the most watched sports I know.

In Arkansas specifically, the Northwest area has very high ranking schools but just a couple miles down south, the schools are struggling. This shows the prioritization in funding based on local big businesses or growing industry. The same could be said for investment in a team, if the players don\u2019t seem like they\u2019ll give a good return on investment in the beginning, they won't get the coach or money they need to thrive.\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?

Is it because teams drill harder the further they get into the tournament, or is it because offense/defense battles are more evenly matched? \n\nThis relates to me and my community because most people in my community are big fans of Arkansas and wish they would've gotten further. \n\nThis graph displays the winners/losers of each round and their scores during the tournament and leads all the way up to the final two.\n\n\"April Showers Bring May Flowers, But March Brings Absolute Dunks!

Total of 126 games were split by 64 men's teams and 64 women's teams. I see that Miami in both men's and women's tournaments made it to the quarterfinals. Also, the women's final game was higher than the men's final game. Looking at the graph overall, the lower number of seeds usually ends up winning the matches. \n\n2. I wonder how seeds are assigned as well as the concept as to why they exist in March Madness in the first place. Something that I also found quite interesting is the first four teams that played were in a separate bracket. Why is that? \n\n3. This relates to my community as I know March Madness fans who discuss seedings and how I honestly never fully understood what they spoke about.

Do you think it is common for one school to be so successful in both tournaments in the same year? How could you investigate this question? You also noticed that the women\u2019s championship game was higher scoring than the men\u2019s championship game. Do women\u2019s teams typically score more points than men\u2019s team, or was the championship game an exception? The \u201cfirst four\u201d teams were added several years ago as a way to include more teams in the tournament. But the single-elimination brackets work best when there is a multiple-of-two number of teams (e.g., 16, 32, 64), so they added these games as a \u201cpre-tournament\u201d to make the field of 64. Maybe there will be a 128-team tournament in the future? Finally, seed are determined by a NCAA committee that looks at won-loss records and other ratings. Why do you think they look at more than just wins and losses?",

One thing I noticed was that on the women's side, there were typically rather large point differences between the various bracketed teams, whereas on the men's side, the margins were typically fairly modest. The majority of the winning teams were from regions in either the midwest or east of the United States, which was something else I observed. Although there may not be much of a difference, I noted that the winning teams for both the men's and women's competitions came from eastern states like Louisiana and Connecticut.\n\n2. I wonder whether there is a regional difference in how close some games are in addition to a gender difference in the point margins. Perhaps it has to do with the popularity of the team, the size of the city where the games are held, or whether or not the team plays on its home court. I wonder if any of these variables could have an impact on the point margins.\n\n3.

    "comment info": "-I observe that the brackets show the equal number of guys and females from the March Madness tournament. The grading for women and males differs and varies more on the female side. In the women's bracket, South Carolina placed first among the first four teams, with L.S.U coming in third despite having more points. The game had a first four because of the amount of teams. The seeding of males and females changed, with the top doing better and the bottom performing worse each time. Not every team made it over to March Madness. \n\n-I'm curious how much the team members' heights differed between teams. I'm also curious in how the teams are seeded, and what considerations are used. I'm interested in learning more about basketball scoring. \n\n-This is relevant to my community since this sport is popular among many kids at my school. Similar to how a lot of people pay attention to the March Madness in my town. Furthermore, I will be starting college soon, and this will be one of the numerous hobbies and sports available, so learning about the scoring may help me comprehend it better.\n\n- Women\u2019s vs. Men\u2019s NCAA Basketball: WHO DOES IT BEST?",

I also noticed the category saying the first four that were placed separate from the bracket at the bottom of each bracket. I also noticed that each state team had a seed and found it surprising that in one case, the number one seed was beaten by the eighth (Kansas vs Arkansas).\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why the first four teams that played weren\u2019t included in the bracket and were instead separated from it. I also wonder what the seedings for the tournaments were based on considering that in some cases, teams that had a lower seed than the other team ended up winning. And I also wonder why some states don\u2019t have representation for both genders such as Alabama.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to my community and I because basketball is very popular among the students in school. And although I don\u2019t play basketball very often I still find it enjoyable to play and watch every once in a while.\n\nHeadline\nCinderella Stories and Upsets Galore: March Madness Brings Thrills and Chills to Fans Everywhere!",

Do teams with better offenses tend to make it farther in the tournament than teams with better defenses? The \u201cfirst four\u201d teams were added several years ago as a way to include more teams in the tournament. But the single-elimination brackets work best when there is a multiple-of-two number of teams (e.g., 16, 32, 64), so they added these games as a \u201cpre-tournament\u201d to make the field of 64.

I wonder why none of the teams which were ranked first were able to make it into the bracket, if they were predetermined to be the best. \n\nObserved:\nI observed that while both teams had upsets within their brackets, the women\u2019s brackets seemed to be much more consistent with rank. For instance, the final four of the women\u2019s bracket included teams ranked: 1, 2, 1, and 3. However, the men\u2019s final four consisted of lower ranked teams: 5, 9, 4, and 5. This indicates that the men\u2019s bracket had more upsets in their bracket leading to lower ranked teams reaching the final four. I also observed that both of the teams that reached the final in both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s bracket were only one rank apart, with the women\u2019s final being between teams ranked 2 and 3, and the men\u2019s being 3 and 4.

Two number 1 seeds were in the Final Four, and the Championship game was played between the number 2 seed and the number 3 seed. I noticed a few upsets at the beginning of the tournament, but the championship match had the top teams in the country. What's very interesting is that this is the first year since 1985 that Stanford, UCONN, or Tennessee has not been in the Elite Eight. I wonder what this will mean for collegiate women's basketball growth in America. This bracket shows the growth of the game away from just the perennially dominant teams such as UCONN, Stanford, and Tennessee and towards up-and-coming programs such as South Carolina, LSU, and Iowa. The men's bracket had many more upsets, like FDU and Princeton. No number one seed was left in the tournament by the elite eight. The final four for last year\u2019s tournament were Kansas, UNC, Villanova, and Duke, teams that are usually at the top of the NCAA. This year's final four consisted of San Diego State, Florida Atlantic University, UCONN, and Miami. Besides Connecticut, most of these teams rarely advanced to the Elite Eight. How will this affect college basketball and the transfer portal? Will dominant teams in the NCAA change dramatically or gradually?

There is a good variety of close games, as well as clear wins.  However, one thing that does stand out is how the women's final had a rather high scoring game and the men's final was much lower.  I wonder how exactly they rank all the teams.  Some teams have better records than others, but are still being ranked lower.

Some examples of this includes Charleston being seed 12 with a 31-3 record and SDSU being seed 5 with a worse 27-6 record for the men's side. Similarly, one the women's side, Gardner Webb had a better record than Utah (29-4, 25-4 respectively), but Gardner was ranked 15th and Utah was ranked 2nd.  It was also interesting how that both brackets had the same number of upsets in the round of 64 (7) and similar upsets in the round of 32 (4 for women and 5 for men), the men had a much lower average ranking in the sweet 16 than the women. The men's average ranking is 4.875, while the womens is a 3.69.\n\nOne thing I wonder about is how the teams are ranked. As mentioned above, teams with worse records are ranked higher, so I wonder what the algorithm is to determine this. What other factors are in play when determining the team rankings?\n\nThis relates to me as I filled out a March Madness bracket myself. While I did pretty poorly, I think brackets are fun, as it provides a light hearted competition and can connect you to the game, even if you don't care about basketball. I personally find sports boring, but I still would constantly check for results and rooting for teams in my bracket.\n\nA headline for this graph could be \"Decoding the March Madness\"",

I wonder how many games were decided by pure chance, not from superior skill or talent. For example, San Diego State University had two consecutive game-winning shots in the quarter and semi-finals. If you look at the Women's tournament, the higher-seeded teams generally prevailed hence fewer upsets. For example, seven of the eight teams in the elite were ranked seed five or below. Additionally, I wonder how these outcomes would change if the tournament was longer and each round had a series of games. March Madness was fun to watch because I like playing and watching basketball in general, and I have roommates from San Diego who were San Diego State fans. Overall, this bracket encaptures how the Men's and Women's tournaments unfolded. Each team was assigned a tournament seed from strength of schedule and regular season record.

For example in the final four, the highest seed was 1 and the lowest was 3 which is very impressive.  Most of the scores from both brackets were really close games and there weren't many blowouts.  In the women's bracket, there were also only two games where a team scored over 100 points.  In the men's bracket, there were no games that reached 100.  The highest-scoring game was 98 put up by Kansas State in the game versus Michigan State in the elite eight games for the East group.\n\nWhat do I wonder?:\n\nI wonder how each team is seeded because initially, I thought it was just the team's record from the season, but it seems like some teams are seeded lower than other teams but they have a better record.  For example in the women's bracket, the Seattle 4 region, Middle Tenn. has a record (28-4) but is seed eleven and Colorado has a record (23-8) as the sixth seed.  \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?:\n\nI do play basketball and watch basketball occasionally.  March Madness is actually something I did watch as it was happening.  I kept up with a few teams and It was fun to see future NBA prospects and these young players going at it with each other.

After observing this data I recorded the point and averaged the 8 most largest ranked unbalanced games.

Overall, teams of the Final Fours of the Women's bracket have higher seed rankings than the teams of the Final Fours of the Men's bracket since all four Women's bracket teams have seed rankings from range #1 to #3 while all four Men's bracket teams have seed rankings outside of the #1 to #3 range. It is interesting to find out that the seed ranking is not always necessarily a good prediction of how well a team may perform. \n\n2. \n\nI am interested in knowing how the seed ranking level was determined. It is based on the past performance of the team in the previous March Madness competitions? Will a team's seed ranking drop if they have a bad performance in the current March Madness competition? \n\n3. \nI am a college student and I am interested in how well my college's sports performances are compared to other universities in the state. I have known students that will lose interest in college sports if they knew their college did not have good sports performances. This graph made me realize how competitive college sports are and why many students become very excited when their college sports team makes it into the Final Four. \n\n4. \n\"March Madness Had Ended After a Long Battle with Both Sweat and Tears \"",

Neither of them had number one seeds in the final, and in the men's bracket the last of the number one seeds were knocked out in the round of 16, so not a single number one seed remained in the last 8 teams of the tournament. \n\nI wonder how often it is that number one or even two seed make it to the final four, or better.  Something else I'm curious about is how seeds are determined. I know that the team's record plays a big role in that, but an example where even that doesn't hold is when San Diego St. is seeded 5th with a (27-6) record, and they play a 12th seeded Charleston team (31-3). Even though Charleston has 4 more wins, they are seeded 7 places below San Diego St. It would be cool to know how much other factors play into seeding for March Madness. \n\nAs for an impact on the community, I think that all of these upsets and seemingly unpredictable factors that happen in games adds elements of thrill and excitement to make for more attention and viewers during the tournament. \n\nHeadline: (Un)Predictable Madness: Men's and Women's March Madness Brackets",

In the men\u2019s division, Houston made it to \u2018round of 16\u2019 as a #1 seed and so did Alabama. Yet, no other teams on the men\u2019s could make it past that point, as a # seed.",

They each start with 64 teams, each assigned an initial seed. The men\u2019s bracket is grouped by simple regions while the women\u2019s bracket is grouped by Greenville or Seattle, numbered 1-4. I also noticed that the team\u2019s previous stats were noted next to the team name in the first round, except for almost all the 16 seed teams. However, one 16th seed team beat the 1st seed in the men's bracket, which I thought was interesting. \nI wonder why they match up the teams in the first round the way that they do. It almost seems unfair to set the 16th seed team against the 1st seed team right off the bat. I wonder if it would be better to pair 1 with 9 and 2 with 10 and so on for the first games. Also, I would like to learn what the region grouping means for the women\u2019s bracket, because I could not quite grasp it from the graph. I am also curious about how many people guessed these exact brackets before march madness started. \n\nThis impacts me and my community because my school was not in a league that participated in the displayed March Madness bracket and I wish my school was good enough to be included.\n\nMy catchy headline would be: \u201cBrack Attack!

I can see that the way they determine who plays who in the first games starts by pairing the highest and lowest seeds and then working inward (2-15, 3-14, etc). However, I wonder how they decide what order these original games will be placed in the bracket because the original placement determines much of who they play in future games. I can infer the sorting of the original games and team seeds stay constant due to it being the same between womens and mens brackets.

However, neither team advanced to the championship. It's also interesting how the two championship teams were fairly matched in seed levels. Iowa was seed #2, and LSU was seed #3 in their respective initial divisions. A similar thing is seen in the men's bracket, where SD state was seed #5, and Connecticut was seed #4 in their respective initial divisions. It's intriguing to see how the teams that were initially given top-seed values due to their superior performance maintained their performance and were ultimately evenly matched in the final game. However, the teams given the #1 seed value, to begin with, don't seem to make it into the championship. I wonder how often a #1 seeded team makes it to the championship and, moreover, actually becomes champion. \n\nBeing a college student with friends who love and play basketball, this is not the first time I have heard about March Madness. It's fun to recognize a few familiar teams on the bracket, like UCSB and UCLA.

Only five of the 16 teams that fit the above criteria actually made the elite 8, which is much lower than I had expected.  I also noticed that the women's bracket final scored far more points than the men's bracket final.  This leads me to wonder why we found this to be true.  Were the defenses in the men's final that much more dominant?  Or were the offenses of the women's final that much more efficient?

Why are teams that are seeded 11 playing these preliminary games when teams ranked 12-15 are not? I also noticed that Miami was the only team the preformed well in both brackets. why is this? I would think that there would be more similarity between men and women's teams in terms of how well thy both preform. A good women's basketball program doesn't necessarily mean that the school also has a good men's basketball program. Why? I also wonder why the number of games played by teams vary so much. For the most part teams have between 30 and 34 games played, however, Hawaii only has 22 games played. Im sure this has something to do with how far away Hawaii is, however, this difference doesn't seem fair.\n\nThis graph related to me and my community because, I go to a university that has both men and women's basketball. \n\nHeadline: Deep dive into divisional differences: Comparing the details of the 2023 Women's and Men's March Madness Brackets",

    "comment info": "1-This image features two separate brackets, one for the NCAA men's bracket and one for the NCAA women's tournament. The women's games also received less points overall than the men's games. I've noticed that there have been more upsets in the men's bracket than the women's, as evidenced by the number of times higher-seeded teams have defeated lower-seeded, supposedly more capable teams. For example, in the men's division, SDSU defeated Alabama, the first seed, by 7 points, while UConn defeated Gonzaga, the third seed, by 24 points. \n2-I wonder if a team's placement was affected by a substitution of particular players during the games. I'm curious to see if these brackets from past years show trends for certain groups in other categories. I doubt the validity of the seedings given the amount of shocks in the divisions, and I wonder whether these upsets will have a ripple effect and affect the seedings the next year.\n3-This is relevant to my neighborhood since many people like playing and watching basketball in my town. Many others in my community could find this information fascinating. \n4-March Madness: They balled out!",

I noticed that for Women's basketball, the games of the final four were very close in points. For the men's side, the midwest and west for the final four teams scores were farther apart. I wonder how normal it is for 1 seed to lose early.\n\n2) What do you wonder?\nI wonder how different the brackets this year look compared to the ones from last year. Did most teams remain in their same position, get in a higher position or lower? I wonder why women seem to have played for more states rather than just cities. \n\n3) How does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to my community because in my town we have a lot of people who like to play basketball and watch it.

L.S.U. won for the women's bracket, but for the men's bracket, Connecticut won.\n\n2) I wonder why there is a difference in the team names/where they come from?

Did they do this because they want to differentiate the brackets when reporting on the score?\n\n3) This relates to my community because I know there are a lot of students in my school that like basketball, and they might be able to tell me why the names/ where the teams are coming from are different.

Furthermore, the women's games scored fewer overall points than the men's games. I've noticed that the men's bracket has more upsets than the women's bracket, as seen by the number of occasions on which higher-seeded teams defeated lower-seeded, perceived to be more competent, teams; in the men's division, SDSU defeated Alabama (1st seed) by 7 points, while UConn defeated Gonzaga (3rd seed) by 24 points. \n\n2) I wonder if certain players being substituted during the games played a role in a team's placement. I wonder if the brackets from previous years illustrate trends for certain groups in distinct divisions. Regarding the number of upsets in the divisions, I question the legitimacy of the seedings, and whether these upsets will have a cascade effect, impacting the seedings for the following year.\n\n3) This has an impact on my community since many students and citizens in the community watch college basketball and like predicting brackets, and these charts demonstrate how difficult it is to make a reliable prediction.

It also results in games between teams that are closer in skill towards the end. \n\nI wonder how the ranks are decided and how accurate they tend to be.

I'm sure schools with strong fan bases recieve more funding for both Mens' and Womens' programs. Colleges with larger student bodies will have an easier time allocating funding and will likely have more talent due to a larger student body.",

I also noticed that on the mens side, 3 out of the 4 teams in the final four had never made it that far before. SDSU in the championship also caught my attention because I almost went there. \n\nOne thing I wonder is what the lowest seed(highest # seed) to win each of the tournaments was. \n\nThis relates to me because my family always has a bracket challenge to see who can make the best bracket.

    "comment info": "Both of these images are similar in the way that they contain the results of each game that has taken place in the March Madness tournament. At the beginning, each team plays another team. However, because this is a tournament, losing makes a team eliminated, which is why there are fewer seeds towards the middle of both brackets. The tournament culminates with a championship game.  \n\nWhile both brackets are structured exactly the same, upon analyzing them, I discovered that very different teams ended up advancing in the tournament when comparing the men and women\u2019s brackets. This leads me to wonder why certain schools have better women\u2019s basketball teams than men\u2019s basketball teams, or vice versa. Is the basketball program for one gender more likely to be good if the other gender\u2019s program is not? Also, I am curious to know what the distribution of funding for both basketball programs are for a given school and how that may play into the quality of their teams. \n\nI have always been into basketball. I started playing when I was 8 and I competed all through high school. My dad also played basketball growing up, as he was both my brother and I\u2019s inspiration to begin playing. Because basketball is a large part of our lives, we are always tuned in when March Madness is happening. Based on the teams\u2019 performances throughout the year, we fill out brackets and make predictions accordingly. \n\nMen vs. Women\u2019s Brackets: The Discrepancies",

If you have a hypothesis that basketball team success is a function of funding, you could supplement these brackets with data on funding.  But, should you use only one year\u2019s worth of data?

    "comment info": "One thing that I noticed is that one-sided women's games involved teams scoring much lower than one-sided men's games. For example, Virginia Tech vs Chattanooga in the first round of the women's bracket resultsed in a 58-33 win for Virginia Tech, a pretty low scoring game. However, the lower scoring games for some of the men's games hovered around 50 points, 1.5 times higher than the minimum for the women's games.\n\nI wonder what the upset rate is for all NCAA March Madness games (i.e, a lower ranked team beating a higher ranked team), as I often hear of plenty of upsets that occur in this setting.\n\nWhile I am not a huge basketball fan, plenty of colleges from my state participate in March Madness, thus many fans in my community tune in to support their teams. So, March Madness captures the interest of many in my community.\n\nA catchy title I thought of is \"The bracket no one made -- again\" as the results of these games are often unpredictable.",

SDSU defeated No. 1 seed Alabama by 7 points, while UConn defeated No. 3 seed Gonzaga by 24 points. Many of the games in the round of 64 were extremely close, with most having only a three-point difference. \n2. Given that they were only seeded fourth in their conference going into the tournament, I'm curious what made this UConn team so good in the playoffs. Who gets to choose which teams get to host the first two weekends? Which men's and women's conferences are eligible for automatic bids? \n3. This is an important topic to me because I grew up in a community where college sports were constantly discussed in terms of commitments and scholarships. Basketball and football are the most popular school sports. Because the March Madness bracket is the topic of conversation for the entire month of March, these graphs have a significant impact on members of my community who are looking for basketball opportunities. Discussing March Madness brackets and watching the games are two of the month's most popular activities for prospective college students. Several games this month, particularly in men's basketball, have completely taken me by surprise. \n4. Is the NCAA Tournament going Bonkers?

Each team is within its own bracket, which determines who will move forward based on if the team has won or not. Another thing I noticed was the date both men and women took their finals. The women were a day before the men's basketball team. I wonder if how many people were close to getting a perfect bracket? I also wonder how long it took to organize the teams and to set up the bracket. The impact that March Madness has on my environment is not as impactful, but it does bring in new hobbies for people to get into. I would say it is also a competition of who would be closest to getting a perfect bracket. What are the odds of getting a perfect bracket?",

I wonder why there are so many teams and if they will ever lower the number by a little or maybe make the final 3 games long instead of just one. I see that there are line brackets pointing toward the final round and it shows what seeding the team is so if they are the number 1 team and have one of the best records or if they are one of the lowest teams in the bracket and have a low record compared to other teams that are in the tournament. The women's bracket is the same exact thing besides some team are different depending what the school is ranked and where they placed during the regular season",

For the men's side, the midwest and west for the final four teams were very far apart in number of points. I also noticed that most of the schools on the women's roster are not on the men's basketball and vice versa. I noticed that in the final four for both genders the scores stayed in the 70s range but for the finals LSU had its big win with 102 points.  \n2. I wonder how the march madness games can affect the ranking of the schools that are number 1 in their region and didn't end up at the top. I wonder how the schools that go against each other in the first round are chosen since they are all in different rankings. I also wonder if playing teams from your region affect who comes at the top from that region since those teams might have played each other before unlike playing someone from a different region in the first rounds. \n3. This relates to me and my community because some of the schools that are D1 in my state almost had a chance of being in the finals. Princeton was out in the round of 14 which was just three games away from finals. If Princeton were to bring the championship to the state, it would bring people in the state together. Getting a win like that for the state can make the other teams in Jersey train harder to continue to win in the future.\n4. Teams of Men and Women Dribble Their Way To Bring The Trophy Home",

It's interesting how the number 1 seed usually gets knocked out right away in this tournament. Statistically, the women's seedings were correct for the most part.  Their placement for the tournament was for the most part correct.  But the men's tournament was all over the place.  I'm wondering how they make the seedings and how it all takes place.  You have a 59 seed facing a 4 seed in the final 2.  It's interesting how it works.  I wonder if there is any strategy that goes into seeding or any statistics that goes into it as well.  If you love basketball, or even the state you grew up in, it makes it a really fun way to cheer them on!  It's fun to watch them win, but also could be upsetting to watch them lose as well.

    "comment info": "1.) One thing I noticed was there were usually pretty big point margins between the different bracketed teams on the women\u2019s side, and fairly small point margins in most cases on the men\u2019s side. Another thing I noticed was that the majority of the winning teams were from places in either the midwest or east in the U.S. This might not be that big of a difference, but I noticed that the winning teams from both the men and women were from eastern places in the U.S. (eg Louisiana and Connecticut). \n\n2.) I wonder if there is not only a gender difference in the point margins, but if there is a regional difference in how close different games are? Maybe it has to do with team popularity, how big the city the matches are played in, or whether or not the team plays at their home court or not. Maybe any number of these factors affect the point margins, I wonder.\n\n3.) A lot of my friends are into basketball, and I\u2019m certain they\u2019ll find the scores and their differences interesting.\n\n4.)

    "comment info": "I initially noticed that as each team is listed in the Round of 64, next to team name is their standings. The four teams from the First Four that make the top 64 do not have their standings included, but in the Women\u2019s Bracket a fifth team, Norfolk State also does not have standings. In the Men\u2019s Bracket, this does not occur seeing as the only four teams without their standings listed are the four teams from the First Four. One aspect of this graph that is excluded that I believe is critical to include is the year. I know that these brackets are for the 2023 N.C.A.A. basketball tournament, but that is not explicitly stated on the graph. As someone who grew up in the South, college sports are a huge deal. Specifically, college football and basketball. The March Madness bracket is the topic of discussion throughout the entire month of March, so these graphs have a huge impact on my community. As a college student, discussing March Madness brackets and watching the games are some of the most popular activities of the month. This month, more specifically for the men\u2019s basketball, I was completely shocked by several games. Teams in high seeds were losing to much lower seed teams. I think a fitting name for this graph would be \u201cThe March Madness Brackets that Drove Fans Mad.\u201d",

I wonder what the odds for each team to win are before the game and I feel like that would be a cool addition. I'm from Washington so seeing Gonzaga loose hurt a little. A title that captures what's going on could be \"LSU and UCON win march madness!\"",
