The dependent variable is the change of temperature through time. I noticed that back then the global tempter was low, as time went by the tempter grew. I also noticed that in between it was leveling up and down.\nMy conclusion is that people should be careful with what they use because in a video my class was watching it showed that when people used hairspray or other things it would ruin the earth's atmosphere or protection cover of the earth. In the video it showed how the earth's protective cover was failing and it just keeps getting worse and worse.",

Why is there a large increase in northeast Europe when mid-Canada (at the same latitude) is in fact colder? Is there a way to stop global warming?

The beginning of the first graph, from around 1880 to the late 1970s demonstrates the variability of the different average temperatures throughout the years, with drastic drops and increases as temperatures sporadically incline, then decrease each year.  Then from the 80s and on, we can see the extremeness of the increasing temperatures, as the temperature continues to increase more and more, reaching way above the flat line it is being compared to.  The reveal also stated that 2019 has been one of the hottest years to date, and as the graph suggests, I wouldn't be surprised that the next passing years will continue to beat that record until serious actions are put in place to help combat the Earth's rising temperatures.",

When people in school or even out of school, used to bring up the topic of global warming, I honestly didn't think twice about it. I thought they were more of making guesses, or had very little evidence but I  was very wrong. If global warming keeps rising at this rapid rate, the outcome will soon be horrendous. We need to start taking action against this as we are huge contributors to the heat. Burning fossil fuels to generate energy is the main source of heat-trapping emissions, generating about two billion tons of CO2 per year. If we could just start by trying to use more and more different energy sources such as hydro electricity or wind power, then we would be able to notice a huge change in the temperature drop.",

I now see that there are some areas on the graph that show positive anomaly values as early as the 1940s. This makes sense considering all the environmental movements in the 60s and 70s that advocated for problems like ozone depletion and global warming. I\u2019m sure it would have surprised these protesters that the same problems they faced decades before are still happening today. \n\nI now look at the graph a different way. I knew that the red columns were bad, but I didn\u2019t know just how bad they were. Since the black line in the middle of the anomaly values represents the global average temperature for 1951-1980 (56.66 degrees Fahrenheit), that means the global average temperature for the 2010s has gone up 33.8 degrees Fahrenheit! That\u2019s insane! When the temperature continues rising, which it will, we could end up having no ice in the poles during the winter, 23% more people exposed to extreme heat, 61 million more people left without water, double the amount of some species losing their habitats, all coral reefs could die off, and small island nations could even submerge. And that\u2019s only if the global average temperature increases by 1 degree Celsius! Mr. Yohe thinks the temperature could increase another 3.",

In my opinion, both graphs show the severity of global warming, especially when they you put the two together. The first graph shows how much it has spiked recently and the second shows certain parts of the Earth that have warmed and to what degree. A takeaway I had from the second graph is that it shows the average temperature from 1951-1980, which was 40 years ago. It is alarming enough to see the change at a first glance, but it is even more alarming to see that 1980 was only the beginning of the temperatures warming on the first graph.",

I think this is because the Ice caps at the top of the earth were previously extremely cold so they would see a more extreme change than other places around the world, and I also think that it's the north part that's affected most because of the industrialization being located all near the north and lesser developed countries being located further south. Secondly I was curious about the lack of information within the lower north sections, seeing as there are expeditions sent to monitor temperatures in the area I was intrigued by the lack of evidence in certain areas. In addition to that I found it curious that some locations became cooler over time rather than warmer, my theory on this topic is I think that the winds (now encountering less resistance) and waters of the melting ice from the north pole flow more now into certain areas than ever before. In this graph and in the map it displays the increase of average temperature over the course of time. The graph displays the increase of average temperature from 1880 to 2019 and the map shows the increase of temperature from 1951 to 2019.

But there was an odd temperature fluctuation in 1940 and afterwards temperatures switched between colder and warmer before the steady incline of hot temperatures starting around 1980 to the highest it\u2019s ever been in the 2016-2019 range. \n\nThe second image, the map, what immediately jumps out at me is how overwhelmingly orange the map is, mith a decent amount of red. There\u2019s barely any blue at all, and unfortunately most of the red is congregated up in the arctic, which doesn\u2019t surprise me due to how much the polar ice caps have melted in even just the last decade. \n\nA few things I wonder, are why was the global temperature fluctuating so much from 1940 to 1980? Why on the map have a few areas gotten colder, what\u2019s different about those places? And what is being done to combat global warming across the globe.",

I can see that as the years go by, the average temperature is moving up in increments of .25. This has already happened three times in the last 39 years and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we hit the +1 degree Celsius mark in the next year or so. For anyone who doesn\u2019t believe in global warming, this graph is a pretty clear sign that it\u2019s real and started in the 80s with the invention of the internet. \n\nEven though the first Industrial Revolution had started before the graph\u2019s x-axis\u2019 shows, the fact that the columns were still in the blue zone after that and even through the second Industrial Revolution reveals just how bad our problem is today. We shouldn\u2019t be having a higher increase in global temperature than what was happening during the Industrial Revolutions when factory regulation was limited. \n\nLooking at the world map, I can see that almost every single place on earth has experienced a recent increase in temperature. Sure it\u2019s been almost a hundred years since the 50s, but the Arctic regions of the world shouldn\u2019t have such significant temperature differences. Regions like Alaska and parts of Russia have had increases up to 3 degrees Celsius! We need to take a step back and decide if mass producing technology is the best for the earth in the long run.",

India and China have almost doubled their pollution in the past 20 years whereas the United States has reduced our emissions by almost 20 percent.

Yes, there are times when the earth is closer to the sun since we\u2019re moving on an elliptical path, but this process restarts every year, so there\u2019s no way that being closer to the sun for some months in the year is going to make that big of an impact on global warming. Instead, I\u2019d say the problem begins in the 1980s with the invention of personal computers, cell phones, and other technologies that would soon be mass produced. This process of mass producing leads to even more manufacturing which pumps a huge amount of air pollutants into the atmosphere every second. That\u2019s just my take.",

As Simone said, the Earth is on an elliptical path and is closer to the sun at certain times of the year, but it cycles annually. I think that global warming problems began in the 1940s as technology and travel were drastically increased in a short period of time due to WWII. From the war to present day, mass productions as well as increased travel have increased pollutants in the atmosphere, which is a much more direct cause of global warming.

At first glance it seems as if our world is melting away at our finger tips and that (according to the graph) we are to far gone to even correct this course. However, with a little bit of study, this graph has some silver lining. First, the changes are miniscule. This is not to say they aren't important but a 1/4 degree change is a lot easier to reverse than a 4 degree change. Also, more importantly, the beginning of the graph shows the earth being much cooler than the average. Now, I don't know if this is just because the average is being dragged up by our current situation but it seems (from this graph) to be a pattern that resembles a wave getting closer and closer to equilibrium.

It's unfortunate to have temperatures rise in cold climate especially the North Pole because the ice glaciers are what \"bounce\" some of the sun's energy off of Earth.

In this graph, other than the obvious increase in temperature over time, I first noticed the variation in temperatures between the years. From 1880-1940 I expected the temperature to gradually increase at an even rate but it didn't. During that time, industrialization was just starting to appear but it seems that nature took its course. However, things changed in 1940 most likely because of World War II. After a period of switching between colder and warmer temperatures, the world started a trend of getting dramatically warmer. The highest peak of warming today almost triples the average temperature of the past. Because of the number of people and supplies we need to sustain ourselves, we are putting a strains on the Earth. Nowadays, people are starting to take notice of our actions because of the impacts they will have on our future. Even my friends at school are starting to protest. However, I still have many questions that I want to be answered. Specifically, referring to the graph, I wonder is why from 1940-1980 the average temperature kept switching between negative and positive? The last thing I wonder is since the average temperatures of today triple that of the past, how much warmer can it get before even more problems emerge? \n\n\"Temperatures Go Up Up Up With No Way Down\"",

There is a NASA article that says that the sun will eventually turn into what they call the 'red giant', which means the sun is getting bigger. In approximately 5 billion years the sun will 'eat' Earth... But before that happens Earth will become too hot to inhabit and we will be forced to leave. Of course, we've got quite a few years before we have to worry about that.",

Another thing I noticed was that in the second graph, the most extreme temperature change was in the arctic regions. I wonder if that's because most of the C02 in the atmosphere concentrates in the northern and southern parts of the globe, or its that the arctic regions are the coldest so small changes impact them more than the rest of the world.

One important thing I notice from this graph is that the average temperatures before 1950 to 1981, specifically from 1880 to 1940 are not only consistently lower than the average temperatures from 1950 to 1981, but there aren\u2019t any specific trends or noticeable shifts in the temperatures, as they tend to hover around an average. On the other hand I notice a specific trend from the years that come after 1980, being a consistent increase in global temperatures each year, and the rate of increase in temperatures, especially approaching 2019, seem to resemble almost an exponential rate.  I believe this shows that global warming isn\u2019t natural because unlike the average temperatures in the past that show little sign of any rate of increase, even with small fluctuations year to year, the trends we are seeing in the graph aren\u2019t just small fluctuations, but large trends that don\u2019t seem to be stopping.

In today's society we all know that the world is getting hotter. There are many reasons that the temperature is increasing, like in the 1950s when everyone was using hairspray, or the large amounts of C02 emitted from cars and large factories. When the production of all of these things were made and used \"in bulk\" they didn't necessarily know the negative effects of it. From the start of the industrial revolution there has been carbon dioxide buildup. However  CO2 doesn't reach the atmosphere until roughly 10 years later. That means that the problems we are having now are causes from things 10 plus years ago.  When I look at this graph I see the effects of  past events. Yes we may be contributing towards future temperature increase but what we are going through today is not from factories that are pumping out CO2 or cars emitting gas right now. I feel that many people tend to place blame on society today when in reality it was the older generations contributing to the rise in global temperatures.",

Although, from 1940 onward, the average temperature would be in the positive more often then not. I wrote that this was because of industrialization which you also seem to think is the case. Back then, people didn't know the long-lasting effects they would have their environment. That is why they did whatever they wanted, much to our dismay.

Natural changes in temperature and climate are normal for the Earth to experience, which is why ice ages have occurred in the past.  However I think it's important to note that generally, those natural climate shifts occur over very long periods of time, unlike what has been occurring with the global climate in the past years.

Then we settled down a bit after that but then we kept going up and down through the years. Then eventually we didn't return to the normal temperatures instead we rose and kept going up. As technology advances and the need for energy goes up. People needed resources to produce energy so we built power plants which caused lots of harm. Then somewhere along the line, we needed to trade with other countries. So we put tons of fuel on cargo ships and sent them across the oceans for resources. This also has a great impact on temperature. \n\nWhat I wonder is can the human race switch over to a new power source that does not cause any harm? My answer to this question is probably not. Other energy sources are cheaper to maintain and can get more power. Whereas I believe one solar panel that's big enough to run a house is probably around 10,000 dollars. Now I'm not a solar panel expert but they go for a ton of money and normal people can't buy them that easily. We would need people to group together or have powerful people to build their own solar panel factories and sell that power to the people. But, sadly people usually go for the cheaper option because in our society money is power. So this dream might never happen unless governments acknowledge this threat and start doing things necessary to stop the temperature from rising.",

Some say that preventive measures need to be taken to solve this problem and some don\u2019t care to even acknowledge its existence, but either way, you can\u2019t argue with statistics. \n\nI noticed that the average global temperature between 1880-1940 stayed below the midline. Industrialization had just begun. But, in 1940, the graph shows a spike in the average temperature for a couple of years. This makes me wonder how the effects of WWII (maximized industrial production, vehicle exhaust, bombs, etc.) could've caused the temperature to rise. Afterall, coal was still the world\u2019s primary energy source which was essential to electricity, production and manufacturing, and transport. The graph shows that the temperature danced above and below the midline until just a couple years before 1980 (probably due to the industrialization of many other countries and the aftermath of WWII). Ever since 1980, the temperature has been constantly above the midline and is well on the rise with no sign of dropping again. \n\nI wonder if we'll ever really be able to slow the effects of global warming. We rely on fossil fuels in our day to day lives for transportation, heating, electricity, and for many other industrial applications. It isn\u2019t like we can just stop using them. However, a gradual decrease of using fossil fuels and a gradual increase of using renewable energy should be something to think about as we go about the future.",

During World War II, factories were being put up left and right, constantly trying to produce the maximum amount of munitions for their respective armies, navies, and air forces. Suddenly, when the war ends, where do all those factories go? That increase past the baseline from 1940 on is a result of World War II through the massive increase in industrialization.\n\nAdditionally, my only question for you is if we embark on a \"gradual decrease of using fossil fuels and a gradual increase of using renewable energy,\" would it even have any effect at this point? Greenhouse gases are already extremely high as implied from the large increase in temperature in the past ten years, and we may be at a point of no return regarding our atmosphere.",

Even with a pandemic going on outside, some of the most frequent news that I see is \"Global temperature rises to decrease by 6% this year. Is that enough to reverse our climate crisis?\" It's difficult to understand such a broad topic, but I found this graph very informative and interesting.\n\nThe first thing that I notice is that when this graph starts, in 1880, the temperatures weren't the coldest. In fact, it wasn't until about 23 years later that temperatures finally reached their all time low. Another thing that I notice is that between the years of 1935-1980, temperatures are, more or less, fluctuating along the centerline. I wonder if there are any patterns or reasons behind why the temperatures in this period fluctuated like they did. Something else that I notice is that after 1980, when temperatures started steadily increasing, they went up very quickly. Based on the numbers on the graph, temperatures have gone up almost .75 degrees from 1980. In only 40 years, our global temperature increased by much more than it ever has in the past, based on this graph. I wonder what practices we implemented to cause temperatures to go up so drastically, and if those practices are avoidable. Climate change has been a concern of mine for some time now, and I considered myself very knowledgeable on it, but this graph opened my eyes to what is really happening to our planet, and it's scary.",

The common answer of why temperatures are increasing so much is the greenhouse effect, which is caused by the immense amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases we produce on a daily basis. My question for you is are we at a point of no return? Have we already passed that point? Global temperature rise is only decreasing by 6% this year and we are under intense quarantine, decreasing transportation pollution by a ton. Even though we are using practically the least greenhouse gases imaginable, the rate of temperature increase has barely changed.

Around 1940, temperatures saw a short spike above average. In the following years, readings fluctuated above and below average. Then, around 1978, temperatures skyrocketed, rising each year to almost 1 degree Celsius higher than average at current. These temperature changes are indicative of the presence of global warming and show the enormous effect modern industrialization has had. \n        In the 1880s until the 1940s, temperatures were lower than average almost every year. During this time, industrialization was beginning in many countries. Factories had begun spewing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The effect of these rapidly accumulating gases was not seen until temperatures began to fluctuate above and below average around 1940. Modern industrialization continued and gases like carbon dioxide and methane kept entering the air. As a result, temperatures started increasing steadily in 1980. Since then, every year has been above average temperature. New temperature records are now set often. Yet environmentally friendly growth has not happened. People continue to use the same devices that have caused this increase in temperature. I can only wonder if the world will ever decide to stop catastrophe by lowering greenhouse gas emissions.",

In this graph, other than the obvious increase in temperature over time, I first noticed the variation in temperatures between the years. From 1880-1940 I expected the temperature to gradually increase at an even rate but it didn't. During that time, industrialization was just starting to appear but it seems that nature took its course. However, things changed in 1940 most likely because of World War II. After a period of switching between colder and warmer temperatures, the world started a trend of getting dramatically warmer. The highest peak of warming today almost triples the average temperature of the past. Because of the number of people and supplies we need to sustain ourselves, we are putting a strains on the Earth. Nowadays, people are starting to take notice of our actions because of the impacts they will have on our future. Even my friends at school are starting to protest. However, I still have many questions that I want to be answered. Specifically, referring to the graph, I wonder is why from 1940-1980 the average temperature kept switching between negative and positive? The last thing I wonder is since the average temperatures of today triple that of the past, how much warmer can it get before even more problems emerge? \n\n\"Temperatures Go Up Up Up With No Way Down\"",

I thought that it was very interesting that you pointed out that the period of industrialization was from 1880-1940, as I hadn't even thought about that. Something really interesting about that is that there was hardly any increase in temperatures during that time, it was mostly going down. I also found it very interesting how you mentioned World War II when talking about climate change. You are definitely right that this likely caused an increase in temperature. I also had the same question about the fluctuation of temperatures from 1940-1980. I wonder specifically if there is a pattern to be seen, that I am just not recognizing. It definitely is scary how much our temperatures today have increased from the past. I pray that we can do enough to keep our Earth healthy.",

This is a bar graph that represents changes in temperatures each year from 1880-2019. The x-axis symbolizes the years and increases by 10 year increments. One bar symbolizes the year in the decade and temperature increase or decrease. The tallest bar above the baseline is the year 2015. The lowest bar below the baseline is in 1903. The main pattern is as the number of years increase, the temperature also increases. The most prominent-looking outlier of the graph is between the years 1939-1945. This was during WWII and inferences can be made that the war equipment and destruction caused the temperature around the world to rise. During WWII, the US had increased the production of high-powered machines such as airplanes and war weapons. The industrial and technological developments caused the temperatures to rise across the globe, as apparent in the map, especially on the poles. These graphs support that waters are also rising by glacier melt.\n\nI wonder if by limiting the industrial and technological developments and minimizing the use of these that exhaust the planet, could the global average temperature decrease back to the baseline? \n\nHeadline: Planet Overheating",

That is the first thing I noticed, that the temperature is increasing and also that it seems to be increasing exponentially. I wonder if it will continue to increase exponentially or if it will increase in a more linear manner.\nAlready everyone knows that the reason for global warming is caused by large amounts of burning greenhouse gases. It is no surprise that humans have caused this to happen and it's up to humans to solve the problem. Due to the Coronavirus many people have had to stay at home and quarantine. The world is experiencing a terrible disaster and sadly many people have died. But because of the lowered amount of burned greenhouse gases many places have experienced less pollution. For example, for the first time in decades people who live in India can see the Himalaya mountains. Possibly this is a wake up call to many people that we need to change the way we live and put the earth's needs before our own.",

It, out of nowhere, began to rise in the 1940\u2019s, but then, in later years it came back down even below where it had been before the surge and was very irregular. I further observed that the first temperature spike was immediately after World War two when there was a boom in new industrialization and factory building. I also noticed that there was a rise in 1980. I believe that the rise in the \u201880s  was due to automobiles becoming something that the average person used around the world, it was also in this time that factory manufacturing became by far the most common way for making goods. Both these things would have caused great influxes in the release of greenhouse gasses which are the primary cause of global warming because they insulate our planet. Since the \u201880s up until now our factory and automobile usage has risen greatly along with our climate and one can assume that it is due to the greenhouse gas emissions.  In the second graph, I notice that the regions with extreme cold climates appear to be the ones with the most significant warming. It also seems that the most developed, populated and industrially advanced places such as China, India and the U.S. that you would assume would emit masses of greenhouse gas, are hardly being affected by rising temperature compared to other regions.\n\n-Caroline Keohane",

In the second graph it's showing how many degrees it's gone up in just a little amount of time and without changing things it will continue to grow but with less and less time in between. \n2. I wonder if these graphs are going to continue growing worse and worse or, are people going to finally notice and do something about it.

    "comment info": "The late 1910's and 20's really starts the upward trend of global temperatures. This has to do with the start of mass market commercial industrialization in the United States and Europe. This is best exemplified in the \"Roaring Twenties\" when American consumers had enough money to buy many products off the factory line. The factories slowed in the thirties due to the Great Depression, but were back up in the 40's due to World War ll. But after that, the temperatures stagnated until the late 70's. And it coincides with the opening of a certain nation. China. Chinese exports really started in the 70's and 80's after the death of Mao Zedong. The aftermath in China led to a massive industrialization effort and a shift to authoritarian capitalism by successive leaders. The upward trend is due to the growing industry in China and India with very few regulations on the environment. This trend will probably continue as many third world countries also start to industrialize in a similar model.",

After it was over we saw a boom in everything; reproduction, manufacturing, electricity consumption, etc.  It was a post war boom.  The power grid came on for most of the world.  Japan started making lots of electronics and there was huge demand for everything.  We burned more fuel as a result.  We pushed more gases into the atmosphere.  It caused what we see here, an increase in temperature.  We didn't know it at the time but this was going to cause us problems.  As more people got cars, more stuff was being moved, and more stuff was being made, the temperature kept on rising.  More, More More.   It kept rising. Until we tried to stop it.

Countries besides Europe and the US began to prosper, the Cold War was drawing to a close, and war was coming to an end. Countries began to catch up, developing factories (which resulted in emissions into the atmosphere, raising temperatures and sea levels) and infrastructure (construction materials can also hurt the environment).\nSo, this begs the question.

As for what the future trends will look like, I believe that if we were to take the year 2020 and look at it on a month-by-month basis, we would see months January-March in the red, and potentially April-September in the blue, because of COVID-19 regulations and such. However, I believe the months October-December will be up in the air, and we have no idea how some countries will respond to the end of COVID, that is if we are even at that point. \nWhile it would be nice for organizations to be more active in reducing the temperatures, I believe countries have become too developed and reliant on technologies and industries that produce emissions and other chemicals that impact our temperatures. When countries talk about whether to gain wealth or protect the environment, the sad truth is, they will pick money every time. I share the same hope with you that in the aftermath of COVID-19, we will become more environmentally conscious, but I still have my doubts if even that is possible in such a money hungry world.",

I wonder if the drastic temperature change between 1880 and now is because of global warming, pollution, or the growing mass of the population on earth. Meanwhile, since the Quarantine, pollution has gone down due to the less use of cars and etc. I am curious as to how this quarantine will affect the global temperature.

For example, the graph shows an increase in temperature in the 1940s, which was also around when WW2 began in 1939. As CFCs (destroy the ozone layer and warm the lower atmosphere), were first introduced in 1928, why didn't we see an increase?\n\nThere is a steady trend since the 1980s, the global average temperature is rising.

I am curious about how this pandemic will affect this year's temperature -- Will the degrees Celsius drop because of reduced transit, the shutdown of smaller factories, etc.? Or, will it increase as a result of our greater dependence on home technology? I also wonder if the temperature spike in the 1940's was a result of wartime industrialization, or the weapons used in WWll. \n\nIn these two graphs, we see temperatures rise primarily as a result of human action.

I also wonder why there seem to be periods of time around the middle of the graph where the data jumps between being above or below the x-axis. \n\nAll in all, the graph and map is showing the effects of Industrialization on global temperature as it has increased pretty consistently from the late 19th Century to the 21st Century.
