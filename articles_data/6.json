This makes me wonder if tariffs are getting higher there and we had to buy them from somewhere else if they would maybe be better quality to last longer. But then it also makes me wonder how expensive the better quality items would be. Then it also makes me think about how the items are made to have so many of them at such cheap prices, probably meaning they are not being made morally right. This would affect me and my community as we all depend on these items in our everyday life and if they became harder to get people would not know what to do without them.

I also notice that lower quality items such as nail sets, artificial plants, and can openers have a much higher percentage of imports from China, rather than higher quality products like wood bookcases, and cars, which are likely made in the United States.\nWhat do you wonder?\n I wonder if the amount of percentages of different products is based on materials used to make them or if it has to do with the pricing of making those different household items. Additionally, I wonder if the percentage of  imports is due to certain areas of manufacturing or how easy it is to import such larger objects compared to smaller ones. This shows us that relations of the U.S. with other major countries is important, and that without good terms, the prices and quantity of everyday items can quickly change.\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\n This relates to me and my community because it makes me wonder if we will be affected by the tariffs placed on these Chinese imports or if prices will change on basic home items. This can change the amount of products we see in the stores and how much more expensive they will become. \nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea.\n \u201cChinese Imports Change Due to Tariffs?\u201d",

I also noticed that products that are considered to be long-lasting and high quality are not imported from China while products that are usually considered low quality and disposable are imported from China at extremely high rates. After looking at the graph, I wondered what qualifies a product as being made in a certain county whether it is the amount of parts made in that county,where it is assembled, or because of other factors . I also wondered where the United States imports products that are considered high quality from since it is not from China.

This is likely due to China's resistance to manufacture goods that are made of materials they would need to import. This shows how the world's industry has formed over time from fabricating what was necessary for living to manufacturing whatever is easiest for profit. These facts show how the industrial age along with the human desire for technological advancement has changed the lives of everyone and how foreign relationships and tariffs affect America in ways such as the affordability and availability of the goods we consume. Overall for the better of human kind  we should try to consume less unnecessary goods and waste less commodities just because they\u2019re common, everything has a cost so we should honor what we have been given.",

Even though these items seem easy to make, the U.S. doesn't have the same setup to build them cheaply right now. This is a big problem because of the proposed 145% tariffs. If these taxes happen, the price of everyday items could triple. For many people, wages aren't keeping up with the rising cost of living. If the cost of things in china double or triple we ar cooked. Basic things such as kitchen tools or cooking items might be less available due to cost. Funny enough it seems like we are a lot more dependent on china then most would think. Tech will become more expensive due to the US being more dependent on china when it comes to computers and manufacturing and until we bring manufacturing back to america we will see the tariffs rise and the increase of chinese appliances.",

Same goes for things like mattresses. Why are mattresses less likely to be imported and what makes something that seems so easy to be manufactured not imported. This relates to the community because the things that are more likely to be imported seem more luxury and the things that are less likely imported but normally more expensive are more of a necessity.

Basic kitchen supplies and coat hangers are standouts. However, there are also a multitude of novelty goods such as fireworks, holiday decorations, and basic electronic goods are all over 90% made in China. I notice that large goods are not made in China as often as compact goods. This is likely because of shipping and storing logistics. I wonder if there is some misleading information in this graph. It states that complex goods like cars and televisions are mostly made in America, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the materials these goods are made of are made in China. I know that China and Taiwan are circuit manufacturing hubs of the world, so even if these goods are constricted in America, that does not mean that the individual components are made in America. This relates to my community because we are largely reliant on Chinese made goods. However, there are alternatives and it is possible on the individual level to limit consumption of unnecessary goods. Vetting what is an actually important purchase created freedom from the culture of over-consumption in America. Trade with China is important in my community, but it is also necessary to at least be self aware of consumption of novelty goods.",

I know from following small startup companies that it is incredibly difficult to afford and manufacture injection molded plastic unless you use China. As for why China has been exporting so hard: China and other Asian countries rapidly industrialized following WW2. Mao's \"Great Leap Forward\" was an industrial campaign that led to the \"purge of intellectuals\" and the second largest famine in history. An estimated 45 million dies, but sources say anywhere from 15 to 55 million could be accurate. However large the death toll, the transition from agriculture to industrialization by force was largely successful. The sure of Chinese trade we are seeing now is a clear result of this industrialization campaign meeting a large demand for cheap \"junk\" goods.

I noticed that a lot of wood products- cabinets, bookcases, closets, and filing cabinets- are more American imports. I also noticed that many rubber products are exported from China. I also noticed that many metal items are gained less from China and more from other exports. These items made me wonder how much of durable exports- metals, woods, and leather- come from over exports rather than China. This poses a question on if China is lacking durable resources or importing less durable goods to American households in order to keep us buying these resources once they break. I also wonder if there is a correlation between cheaper products being exported from China that in the long run break and we continuously replace. This directly relates to us personally as this is a typical household with items that we are continuously replacing and using in our everyday lives. In my future I hope to go to college where I will need to buy household items and need for them to be durable and cheap as I will be buying them on a college budget. This also poses difficulty for house owners as we now have a high inflation rate to even buy a house which makes it more expensive if we are continuously replacing items made of less durable materials that break. If I had to create a headline for this info graphic I would title it, \u201cHow Much of Your House Comes From China.\"",

One other thing that I notice almost everything electronic comes from china.  One thing that I wonder why china doesn't export cars like other countries do. I also wonder why china exports most all of alarm clocks to america and not from, other countries. Why are TVs the only electronic that we do not import from china and where do we get them from.  This can be related to my community because most everyone in the community uses imported goods in their daily lives. Simply a upset from china could greatly effect me and all the people around me lives. Also with the new terrfis this can also effect imports which can greatly effect our community and our daily lives.  The headline that I created was \u00a8Import Percentages\u00a8",

Most of the Chinese imports are either electronics like microwaves, or appliances like umbrellas or pots and pans. The more complex stuff, like television and cars, is not from China. The other thing is that China also makes most of the furniture, except for couches. The items we don't get from China are mostly made of natural resources or storage items like filing cabinets. This is crazy important because almost everyone has most of this stuff growing up or in their house. This shows the china\u2019s power and our reliance on China. China is the number one producer of exports. This makes me think of who is close to being close to China on exports, and who is the has the most imports. This would show who spends more money on imports, and not on self-improvement.",

For those items that are more mechanical, plastic, and not as long lasting have the highest percentage of made in China of 80% or higher. While on the other hand for items that have 15% or less of china imports are mostly lasting products such as mattresses, tvs, tables, and cabinets. This is a direct correlation to how independent most Americans are on products that are imported from China. Although nationally if tensions between America and China were to get heated, high tariffs in place to limit Chinese products, or if they were to run out of supplies or buyers this would drastically affect the prices of items that Americans use and to some are necessities. This graph is a wake up call to Americans of just how much we rely on Chinese made products and how we need to keep good relations between the two countries unless the American government decides its time to become independent not just ourselves but for daily products we use every day and for the rest of our lives.",

The uncomfortable truth is that even with tariffs on Chinese imports, people prefer to to buy them since they're cheaper.

This reliance raises concerns about economic stability, inequality, and how nations would cope if China suddenly stopped exporting these goods.\n\n3. Our group is made up of diverse students with different perspectives. The Chinese students shared that this global trade benefits their country by boosting its economy and industrial growth. They believe that as China continues to manufacture and export goods worldwide, it will become even more powerful over time.

Products made from wood like closets or shelves and upholstered furniture are not being imported from china\n\n2. I was wondering that America only imports about 2% of cars from China which was weird to me since China has one of the biggest automobile industries in the world.\n\n3. The impact this has on our community is that we are relying way too much on goods being imported from China. Due to tariffs products cost double or tripple to the original price.

I think that the reason for this choice is that we can buy these products for cheap and in bulk. I also think that China has more of the resources that are needed to create electrical equipment, and that's why we buy from them, along with the cheap labor costs. I also agree that we rely too much on imports, especially from China, and this is a problem because if China chooses to no longer sell to us, most of our products would no longer be mass-produced, and we would be left with a lot of debt to pay off as well.",

I had not realized that China has one of the largest automobile industries in the world which makes this an even more interesting situation. Being that that is the case, why then avoid the importation of automobile products even when they are probably cheaper and instead import from other places and most likely be spending more money.

Why are certain items virtually entirely created in China and others elsewhere? I wonder if trade tensions, tariffs, and supply chain disruptions have influenced these results. Another concern is how dependent the U.S. economy is on Chinese manufacturing and what would happen if imports stopped. Could the U.S. produce or find suppliers for these goods?\n\n3.

This brings up the question that even if its made in the US, if the parts are from China, does that really mean it's American? Maybe the US just wants to keep the large things of value made in the Country so they have some leverage and don't just completely rely on China for household items. Regardless, this graph does say something about the relationship between the US and China, but that can be interpreted in many different ways.",

What is stopping us from making them here? I don't think it would be too difficult to make alarm clocks or toasters but for some reason over 99% of both of them are coming from China. That worries me a bit though, thinking back to the fact that they are thinking of giving all of them 145% tariffs which unless they start to be made here, could nearly triple the price. I know that people have been making less money than the prices of most things recently which the gap keeps getting bigger. That means that the already high prices of things is going to keep getting higher for the future generations like me; so if you even double the price of everything coming from china would mean we would have to sacrifice a lot. Alarm clocks and toasters would be something a lot of people cant have and even things like books, decorations, fireworks, and grills, would be difficult to own for the average person.",

The problem with this is that America doesn\u2019t have the raw materials or resources to make it own products at the moment. Even if America were to make its own products, the resources would still need to be imported from outside countries. Now when it comes to price, tariffs are threatening our livelihood as we know it. Many American families are already low income and have little funds to purchase everyday items, but with tariffs household items may soon be out of reach for most families.

What impact does this have on you and your community?\n\nThis impacts us because the new tarrifs that have been applied in the US make it more expensive for us to import products from China, aswell as some placing no longer wanting to do business with the US because of the prices.\n\n4.

For example, first-aid kits (90%), umbrellas (98%), baby strollers (97%), and alarm clocks (>99%) are almost entirely from China. This shows that Americans rely heavily on China for certain types of products, especially smaller household goods and electronics.\n\n2.

Regardless, the items such as cars, wood tables, rugs, filing cabinets, and a few other items are the exception, not the rule. Furthermore, I wonder how this will affect things on a larger scale; if prices do rise it will affect a large quantity of people, which leads me be curious as to how much they will increase and how, more specifically, it will impact people. Also, while I do see the value in thinking about how this relates to my community since each community is a part which works to make up the whole, I think it would be wiser to view how it impacts people, places, and countries in a more large-scale way.

For example, first-aid kits (90%), umbrellas (98%), baby strollers (97%), and alarm clocks (>99%) are almost entirely from China. On the other hand, some items like mattresses (2%), cars (2%), and wood closets (4%) have very low percentages from China. This shows that Americans rely heavily on China for certain types of products, especially smaller household goods and electronics.\n\n2. What do you wonder?\nI wonder why some products, like alarm clocks or baby strollers, are almost entirely imported from China, while others, like cars and mattresses, are mostly made in the U.S. or other countries. I also wonder how this reliance might change if tariffs increase further, and whether these products could realistically be made in the U.S. without becoming extremely expensive.\n\n3. How does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to me and my community because many of the products we use daily\u2014like computers, kitchen appliances, or toys\u2014are made in China. If these items suddenly became more expensive due to tariffs, it could impact household budgets and change shopping habits. For local businesses that sell these products, higher prices might reduce sales.\n\n4.

The things like umbrellas and nail supplies are not needed to be kept around but will be found mostly in all homes. More of the larger furniture such as your bed sheets, carpet, dinning table or closet are found in blue. \n\nI wonder why the larger things are more made from things in the usa and why are the things in red not really needed but yet a lot of Americans still have them? Can this be part of the idea that americans buy things that are just not needed and thats how other countries like China can make a good profit off of us? Why does the US tend to only make things that are more so the fundamental of the house compared ot the thigns that they let the other countries build? \n\nHow can this relate to me and my community is by understanding what things are being produced in other countries and what other things are being made and used from our own country.

I wonder when this pattern began because not long ago most things were made in America. I also wonder if the rise of online ordering systems had an impact.  I wonder if America lacks resources to provide all of what is demanded to the population without outsourcing, but I wonder if it is more likely to be due to lower costs for production in China. This relates to me and my community because this directly reflects all of our consumption patterns. We are influenced by our own consumption rate, and if things are produced cheaper in China, we have a higher likelihood of buying those products in comparison to domestic.

Some stuff, like cars and mattresses, don\u2019t. The graph shows this by using darker orange for higher numbers. \n2. I wonder why so many things are made in China instead of the U.S. I also wonder what would happen if we couldn\u2019t buy things from China anymore. Would everything cost more? Would stores run out of stuff? \n3. This affects me because almost everything we buy is from China. If prices go up or trade stops, people in my community might have to pay more money for the things they need. It shows that we depend on China a lot. \n4.

How does this relate to you and your community? \n\nthis relates to me beacuse a lot of the stuff i use everyday like phones, and kitchen items probably came from china. it shows how connected our lives are to global trade. just how stores depend on these imports to stock affordible products, so changes in trade could affect prices or whats avalible. \n\n\"From microwaves to Make-up brushes, americas home run on chinese imports.\"",
