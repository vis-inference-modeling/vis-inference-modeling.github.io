There is an overwhelming higher presence of blue dots relative to very few purples dots suggesting that Serena win outcome generally supersedes her loss outcome. Another observation I gathered from the data set is that what really solidifies this idea that Serena is the GOAT stems from the fact that she has been everyone, regardless of  the age discrepancy between the players. From a very young age, Serena was beating opponents 5-10 years older than her with a lot more experience than her on tour. Likewise, even when Serena is older than her opponents, and possibly less agile than more youthful competition, she still dominates the court, winning the whooping majority of all her matches. \n\nRegarding my observations on how the data is presented, the data follows a slight linear progression that is primarily blue (victory), which supports the idea that while her age is increasing, Serena still manages to consistently secure that victory, regardless of her age, making her, the Greatest of All Time.",

I wonder why she occasionally stopped playing as there are big gaps between clusters of wins/losses.\n\n3. She was a famous tennis player and she inspired people to try their best. She was admired by the community and she left a mark on the hearts of many people.\n\n4. \"Serena's Life and Career\"",

I also noticed that she was older than most of her opponents throughout her career. \n\n\nI wonder why Serena played so many matches between the ages of 29 and 36 and how she was able to win the majority of those matches. Another thing I wonder when looking at this graph is how the amount of wins compared to losses seems to remain consistent for the most part.\n\n\nThis graph relates to me and my community because it shows that just because you get older doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll start slowing down. Serena played just as many matches when she was 36 to 40 as she did when she was 14 to 18. It also shows that practice and consistency really is important because it helped Serena Williams play at the highest level with extreme success for 26 years.\n\n\n\u201cWhile Serena Williams gets older, her serves get faster.\u201d",

Finally, I notice that she only ever had one massively outlier game where she was younger than her opponent by 10+ years despite being 31.\n\nI wonder how Serena kept motivating herself to continue playing even after all her success, lifelong fame and wear and tear on her badge. I wonder how many other players have managed to get to her age range while still playing professionally, and additionally how many managed to maintain their play level while aging like Serena did. \n\nWhile she didn't influence me personally, I can see how she impacted the lives of members of my community, the black community. Serena Williams influenced young black people and girls in general to push and work hard for the careers they dreamed of, opened up paths for black people to try for career fields that weren't typically for black people, and pushed black people and women into trying for professional tennis careers that they otherwise wouldn't have even thought about.\n\nA good way to summarize this graphs contents is to say that it is displaying the wins and losses of Serena Williams' career while also comparing the age of both her and her opponent in those matches.

Serena Williams, as she aged, became the older opponent in the majority of her matches. As she grew older, however, she did not decrease in playing level. In her early 30s, Williams played the most amount of the matches and also appears to have won the majority. She seems to have a higher winning streak against younger opponents but has a high concentration of losses against players her age. This is likely because opponents had the same level of skill and the same amount of experience. The graph begs the question, as Williams aged, were her physical capabilities limited or did her experience propel her to be a better player?\nAt certain points in the graph, there are gaps in data. Around age 22, it seems as though no matches were played. Certain points also show a trend of losses. After her mid-30s, Williams played fewer matches and the amount of wins and losses appears to be split evenly. \nI would headline the graph, \"Serena Williams Proves: Age is just a Number\".",

There were more championship matches when she was 30-35yo and less from 35-40yo.  We wonder what was her overall win/loss record?  Who were her first and last opponents?  What happened when she was 29 and 36 (no data)?  Are there more older athletes still performing at a high level today (i.e. Tom Brady, LeBron James), or are they more celebrated now?  For impact, we wonder how engineers are adapting.  Do they need to design products differently with older athletes in mind?  We also talked about recovery processes.  Do we have better recovery processes and procedures already available to extend the life of the athlete, or is this something we need to continue developing?

She also won a lot more games than she lost so that really shows that despite her age, she still won most of her matches. But even though she started playing pro at 14 she didn't  start winning until she was 16 years old.\n\nWhat I wonder: She had a few gaps from 14-16, 29-30, 35-36, were these gaps caused by injuries, or something else? If she had played for longer would she have continued winning or maybe gotten more losses from that point on?\n\nHow this connects to my community: I play on a soccer team and my team loves to win, but even though we always try our hardest we still lose sometimes, it just shows that there's always going to be someone better than you.\n\nWhat I think this graph shows: I think this graph shows that she had a lot of wins all through out her career.\n\nCatchy headline: Serena, Dominating Through Decades",

This topic impacts my community and I because it is important to have successful female athletes for young girls to look up to.

There are more wins than losses. She played more games when she was younger. After her pregnancy, she made a comeback in her thirties and played a lot. She played the most games between the ages of 29-35. I wonder why she took a break from playing at ages 35-37. She beat many older/more experienced players as a young player. The losses are really spread out, there isn\u2019t one cluster or one year/age that she was notably worse. This shows us that age is not that important of a factor in performance.

This indicates that Serena William has won significantly more matches than she has lost, no matter the age of her opponent. \n\n2. I wonder if the exact ratio of matches won to matches lost was statistically consistent as Williams aged. I was also curious as to what occurred in Williams life and career at the age of 29 because the graph indicates that she did not have any matches in this time.\n\n3. This graph is a dot plot indicating a positive correlation between Serena William's increase in age and her gradually becoming older than her older than her opponents. However, despite the graph showing that William's was older than her opponents for more than half of her career, she continued to win matches and thus remain competitive in the tennis community. Therefore, this graph is a testament to William's skill in the field of tennis.\n\n4.

    "comment info": "The graph of Serena Williams's Professional Matches shows that her wins are much greater than her losses. At every age, Serena has consistently beaten her opponent more times than she has lost to them. Furthermore, the graph shows that as Serena has gotten older, she has been older than her competition. The graph also shows gaps and inconsistencies at different points in her career. For example, there is a break in matches around the age of 36 because that is when she had her daughter. What could some of the other gaps in the graph be? Could they be due to injury or unforeseen circumstances that forced her to stop playing for a time? I believe that this graph is showing Serena's consistency as a player as she has aged, and despite the growing age gap between her and her opponents, she has remained one of the greatest tennis players of all time. The headline for this graph is \"Age is just a number: Serena smashes stereotypes and proves that the GOAT is dominant at any age\"",

I would name this Serena VS.because throughout her career she's faced challenges and being underestimated just to end up proving that no matter what it is she has to go up against she could do it.",

She also won so many games more than her amount of losses. She was even playing professional tennis at the age 14 which as actually very impressive.  She lost but not as much as her wins.\n\n2) I wonder how was she able to playing professional tennis at such a young age. I would understand if it was regular tennis but but professional.... that's very impressive. Since Serena retired at 45 I wonder would she be able to retire at a younger age because people usually always rettire when they are older.\n\n3) This graph affects me because it shows that you can start from nothing and work your way up. Serena was in a middle class family and she was black when she was younger so she must have went through so many difficulties but she still ept trying. She shows that no matter what don't give on your dream\n\n A title hat I would say the graph represents is \"Serena Williams: The living legend\".",
