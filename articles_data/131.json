Some of the people are a health risk(including myself) but still decide to help serve others in the community.

The virus has definietly affected many different workers so I just wonder what the approach is now to protect them better. \nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nThe impact this has on my community and I is that those who are essential workers are at a greater risk at catching the virus because they have to go out into the community as part of their job. This could mean more people getting sick and then leading to more people in the community being infected. \nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?

Healthcare, food preparation and serving, and transportation have the largest amounts of frontline workers\n\nWhat do you wonder? I wonder when those essential workers will be receiving the vaccine.

It also makes me wonder what stores (Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid etc.) will be carrying the vaccine besides Hospitals. \n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?Personally, this impacts my community because some people in my family are in the Healthcare category which could mean they could be vaccinated earlier than other jobs. My mom is a registered nurse and has already received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and receives the next vaccination in three weeks. This continues to have an impact because it could mean that we are getting closer to herd immunity if more and more people continue to be vaccinated.

Specifically I noticed that the medical sector (despite its critical importance) is only a small part of the frontline workers. I also notice that most of the educational sector belongs to the essential occupations.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nKnowing logically the vaccine will be distributed to frontline workers first it makes me wonder if certain frontline sectors are as important. For example, are fast food workers more important in the factor of getting vaccinated than educational workers? Even Though students and teachers can go to school remotely shouldn't it also be an important factor to work in person physically than chefs for example \n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nI think this graph shows significantly as well how the virus is able to spread. In terms of how easily if measures are not met at specific places ,like fast food chains, the virus is more likely to spread. It also impacts how I perceive occupational importance in my community.

I also wonder what the infection rate and mortality rate is for each occupation and whether this affects vaccine priority and accessibility.  \n\nThis impacts me because I know people who are frontline workers and essential workers. With limited supply and increasing infection rate, the prioritization of who receives the vaccine is important. While frontline workers have greater exposure and are more likely to catch COVID, cases spread quickly among the general population. Public places, like schools, that are open are also vulnerable, and therefore those with educational jobs can be as susceptible as frontline workers. COVID has affected many families, especially those with members who are essential and frontline workers.

What impact does this have on you and your community?\n\nThis impacts my community and I, because now I could see the amount of people that are in the frontline.

    "comment info": "After analyzing The New York Times graph of frontline and essential workers we notice that there are more frontline workers than essential workers. We also notice that the job with the most amount of people in the field is food preparation and serving. Another thing we noticed is that it mentions a lot of specific jobs rather than just an overview. We wonder what are some things that would consider a job essential. For example, why are postsecondary chem teachers frontline, while special education teachers are essential. We wonder how many people in each field have covid.  This infographic would be very helpful for someone who unsure of what field to go into and what jobs are protected and affected by epidemics and shutdowns.  This affects our community because there are more people putting their life at risk and more people at risk to get covid. A catchy title we would use is \u201c Essential Workers vs, Frontline Workers, Who Should be Our Priority.\u201d",

Whom Do We Save First With the Vaccine?\" (Jan. 3, 2021).  Different states also can prioritize who gets the vaccine in slightly different ways.

Within the swarms, there is a variation of different size bubbles. In the groups of bubbles, they are color-coordinated. In grey, it means the works are essential, and in yellow the workers are frontline. I wonder why in the groups of bubbles that have a majority or a majority yellow have some small bubbles of grey or yellow? After moving my mouse over the bubbles in the health care, speech-language pathologists and psychiatrists, and healthcare support workers. Why are these healthcare workers not considered frontline workers and only essential workers? This has an effect on my community and me as we can now see which jobs are considered to be frontline and essential works. Although people have usually thought that nurses and doctors were frontline workers and people that work at the grocery store are essential, but there are many more people and so many more jobs considered to have frontline and essential workers. \n\nTitle: \"Essential and Frontline jobs in 2020\"",

These are millions of people, and working to them all vaccinated is bound to have issues.\n \nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nWith high numbers of frontline workers, vaccinations are more likely to take a longer time in logistics. It is self-explanatory that healthcare workers, in all probability,  be vaccinated before anyone. Consequentially, with many frontline and essential workers, these vaccines' transportation can be an extremely troublesome issue. Mass rollout of these vaccines may take more than months to get workers vaccinated or get half of them vaccinated.

There are a lot more industries that have essential and frontline workers than I would've imagined. \n\nI wonder which industries will receive the vaccines the quickest. I already know the health care workers will get priority and I assume other frontline workers would be next, but which essential industries would be next in line to receive vaccinations? Will it go in order of the size of the industries or will be there be different means of determining priority? \n\nThis impacts me and my community because the graph shows that almost any occupation is somehow affected by the coronavirus and that so many of my friends and peers parents are in dire need of the vaccine to be able to work at all. I am lucky my dad can work from home and my mom is a teacher who is following a hybrid schedule like me, but many other workers are not so lucky. One of my closest friends recently got Covid-19 because her dad is an essential worker who knew he was being exposed at work, but he still had to go in anyway. Lots of families are in similar situations, where either the parents have no choice but to expose themselves, or became unemployed. Hopefully the vaccines are available to all these industries as soon as possible to stop the spread.\n\nHeadline: \"Frontline Workers Battle for Vaccine Access\"",

When people think transportation they usually think of delivery drivers such as those who work for UPS, USPS, and Prime who deliver packages to your door.

Then I think elderly and people with preexisting conditions who work in frontline occupations should get the vaccine after healthcare workers.\n\nThe production of the vaccines are moving slow and this impacts my community because many of my family friends work in frontline occupations. They are scared they are going to get sick and are waiting patiently for the vaccine. This also impacts me as a student and fellow students because I know some larger public schools haven't been able to open this year and hopefully with a vaccine schools will be able to open full time and students doing remote can go back. \n\nFrontline workers: Who Should Get the Vaccine First?",

They typically are also the jobs that involve serving directly to customers with no buffer between them and the public such as a manager might have. The essential workers typically are more managerial positions in the same fields, and have jobs which are easier to virtualize.\n-I wonder how the creators of the infographic came to the conclusions they did regarding the placement of certain jobs within the context of the rest of their field.  For example, in the education field all persons are considered essential workers except chemistry teachers and SPED teachers, who are considered front line.  I understand the Special Education teacher\u2019s designation, as they need to be in the building with students, but don\u2019t understand Chemistry teachers. From my experience, most high school science classes are lab classes, so all would require a teacher to be in the building regardless of whether they are a chemistry course or not.\n-My community is primarily made up of educators and frontline workers. It is clear from both the shear number of frontline workers, and their inflated levels of exposure that they should be vaccinated first.  In my opinion, the next group of people should be those that can perform their duties of home, all be it, at limited productivity, so returning to the work place would be beneficial.  These could include educators, athletes, corporate employees.\n-The Vaccine, are you a golden ticket holder?",

It is definitely a tricky situation to decide who should receive the vaccine first. It was interesting to see how teachers are essential but not frontline. I think we should be in person because I think online education is not a way most students learn beneficially. I wonder how frontline and essential workers are categorized? Such as who decides what is essential in life and or more valuable for America. For the community, I think this whole pandemic has taken a toll mentally, physically, and emotionally for a lot of people. Many people are losing their businesses and jobs left and right. This graph is showing us all how many people are considered frontline vs. essential workers. A catchy headline would be- \"Which group of workers first gets a chance to save themselves, and those they love\"\nThank you!",

I noticed healthcare workers, transportation,food prep, serving and production are front-line occupations. I wonder why the graph is shown this way? I also wonder why aren't computers essential? This impacts my community because people are returning to their daily lives and are waiting to be vaccinated. A catchy headline can be \" who is next?\"",

I also notice that a lot of the majority frontline occupations should get the vaccine . Another thing I notice is that the orange color are workers who are at risk and grey means essential for the economy. \n2~ I wonder why there are only two colors in the graph, I also wonder why educators aren\u2019t being mentioned they have been a huge impact on us not only us students are affected but so are the educators they are there to help us with any trouble we have. \n3~ This has an impact on me and my community because a lot of our important workers have been impacted during this pandemic. A lot of people including my parents have been hugely impacted I know how hard they work and no matter if they are sick they still go to work.\n4~ Whats going on in this graph is that its telling what position does essential and front line workers have and how they have impacted us. A catchy headline that captures the maps main idea would be \u201cWHAT\u2019S THE NEXT STEP?\u201d.",

This means that they are at risk of getting Covid just by going to their jobs. It's important that frontline workers receive the vaccine first so that they can do their jobs as safely as possible.",

I also noticed that not all of the jobs in health care are frontline. I wonder nothing computer wise is considered essential. I thought that it was very important to us and the advancements it has lead us to would make it be considered \"essential\". I also wonder why the information is being showed to us in this way? Is there a certain reason or is this just the more convenient/easier way to show everything to us. This impacts my community because more people are starting to go to work instead of doing it at home. Which could lead to more cases of the coronavirus.

The next thing I noticed was the meaning of each circle and size. The size of the circles represents the amount of people in each category. Each cluster of circles represent a specific genre of frontline jobs. The circles in each cluster go into specifics about exactly what the people do and how many people do it. The third thing I noticed is how the job with the biggest circles, or most people, is food preparation and serving. The next thing I noticed is how sales only has four categories while things like production have much more. The last thing I noticed is the different colors used in the graph.\n   The first thing I wonder is why did the designer chose to display the information like this using sizes of circles to display each population.

For example, the production field is larger than the entertainment, sports, and media field due to a larger number of occupations.\n\n2. I wonder about the criteria for essential and frontline occupations. Why are specifically postsecondary chemical teachers considered frontline occupations? Why aren't other subjects such as biology and English also considered frontline occupations?\n\n3. The impact is the importance of certain occupations within society. Healthcare occupations are predominantly frontline because people need to make sure that their health is taken care of, especially during a pandemic.\n\n4. This graph shows the importance of various occupations within society, and how frontline occupations should probably get vaccinated first because they are more exposed to people.
