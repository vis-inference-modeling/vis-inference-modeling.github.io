However, a quarter of people who have bachelor\u2019s degrees or graduate degrees work from home. Even some high school students or those with less education have a home-based job. \n2. I wonder what kinds of jobs some high school students or those with less education do remotely. In my community, most high school students work in person. For instance, they work at convenience stores or supermarkets. So, I can\u2019t imagine what kinds of jobs American high school students have. \n3. If working remotely becomes widespread and popular in my community, it will be difficult for young people to learn manners as a member of society and how to communicate with other people well. \n4.

Workers with a bachelor's degree or higher are much more likely to work hybrid or fully remotely, while workers with a high school diploma or less overwhelmingly work in person. This trend puts into light the effect of education on job type and flexibility.\nMoreover, racial and age disparities in hybrid/remote work opportunities reflect broader inequities in job distribution and accessibility.\n\nWhy do workers with more education have more remote opportunities? Is this a job-type issue, a technological access issue, or a preference of employers?\nHow has the pandemic reshaped workforce norms? For example, will the increase in remote work stabilize or continue to grow?\n\nIn many communities, including mine, this graph reflects ongoing shifts toward hybrid or remote work in office jobs. Friends and family with college degrees have seen improved work-life balance due to remote options. However, those in service or healthcare roles still have to work in person, often facing long commutes and inflexible schedules. This highlights the need for systemic changes to address these disparities.\n\nWork Flexibility Depends on Education: A New Divide in the Post-Pandemic World.",

It's true that the majority still work in person, and that aligns with industries requiring physical presence, such as healthcare, retail, or manufacturing. To your wonder, I\u2019d add: how might the continued evolution of remote technology further shift these trends? For instance, will traditionally in-person jobs like education or medicine adopt hybrid or remote options more broadly in the coming years?

Your reflection on the use of the word \"sophisticated\" is thoughtful because job complexity isn't always tied to formal education, and this nuance is important to note. It is interesting the way you related this to your own journey, as many of us have probably seen a similar change in job flexibility due to increased education.

For example, someone older who is getting their bachelor's degree might have a job or other responsibilities that prevent them from going to school in person, whereas a teenager in high school usually would not have that problem. This clear divide may also be due to the fact that the college one attends is not always local, and students may not be able to dorm or move.

Many workers now have the option to work from home, and hybrid work combining remote and office work has become much more common. Office attendance has dropped, but it hasn\u2019t disappeared entirely. It\u2019s also interesting to see how flexible work environments are, with some companies offering remote work permanently while others require a return to the office in some capacity.\nI wonder if the shift to remote work will stay as high as it is now or if people will return to offices in large numbers once the pandemic's effects lessen more. Will remote work continue to be a popular choice even if there is a shift back to in-person work? I\u2019m curious if remote work is just a temporary trend or if it will become the \"new normal.\"\nThis shift to remote and hybrid work is relevant to me and my community because many of us are in school or early in our careers, and the way people work will impact our future job opportunities and daily lives.

Working in-person also probably takes more money to get to work and more time, which is interesting because the people with the lowest levels of education are the ones doing it the most.

They aren't limited to the local pool of applicants and can work with much better talent, thus creating a much stronger company, with more dedicated employees.  Companies that force \"return to office\" have lost everytime. That management style has only served their competitors the companies most talented people.  Office life was a huge waste of resources, for the employer and the employee.  Notably, the price of entry into remote working appears to be a college degree.",

The amount of people shown declines as the level of education increases. The next think I noticed as high school learning almost has fully in person. Maybe this is because people in high school needs the most hands on learning in order to grasp a concept. Also high school is often stressed as being more important in order to achieve future goals.  I wonder why degrees have more online and hybrid learning. Maybe it is because sometimes classes are off campus and the pandemic made the perfect excuse for online classes to be a must. This affects me and my community because I have experienced all of these learnings. I would say it is easier to focus in the classroom.

I noticed that people with only high school diplomas are the most likley to work in person, but they are also the biggest group working. I wonder why that is. Perhaps it is because less and less people are getting a college degree and are instead learning a trade. This tracks because trades are typically in-person careers.

This is a visual representation of how those with low academic abilities are more likely to be affected by the pandemic due to the lack of opportunity presented to them rather than those with higher degrees. Another noticeable attribute is that the higher degrees individuals have in academics, the more likely they are can work hybrid jobs, or fully remote jobs. This could potentially mean that more educated people were less likely to have been affected by the pandemic than others.",

As the graph progresses in the level of education, more people are involved in virtual jobs.\n2. After studying this graph, I wonder if these virtual shifts were bound to take place given our modernizing society or if the pandemic was needed to propel these changes. I also wonder, especially considering the differences in degrees, what this graph would look like if we only considered office jobs or typical 9-5s. I feel that these have been the greatest affected by the virtual shift.\n3. This relates to me specifically, as I have worked both ways. Not only have I had to work virtually as a student during the pandemic, but I have also worked virtually for my uncle's law firm. I have numerous jobs throughout the year where I work fully in person, and I have to say I far prefer these. I don't think anything virtual can match the level of human interaction and connection that is built in an in-person workspace.\n4. A World Post-Pandemic: Will the Workspace Ever Be the Same?",

I also notice a trend of an increase in the percent of people working remote and hybrid jobs as the level of education advances. Furthermore I wonder why this is and I believe I know why. Thinking about the jobs that require these higher levels of education it makes sense that they are able to do more out of office work. Here in southeast Texas a lot of the industry is dominated by refineries and looking at the work structures of these refineries we can see how this trend is proven. Looking at the lower ranks of refineries we have the blue collar hands, most of which only graduated high school, do repairs and maintenance on the equipment use and that require the employees to be there on site. However for someone higher up like an engineer, all of which have  level of education past high school,  occasionally go out into the field but most of the time are in their offices doing calculations, looking at numbers, or in meetings all of which can be done on a computer.",

I feel that for the most part this is caused by their academic background. There is also a solid content of people with a college degree who work in person. However, from a high school degree the amount of remote and hybrid workers increases. As we go to the bachelor's degree, we find that this category has the most hybrid and fully remote workers out of any category. Lastly, a graduate's degree almost has a balance. You can categorize hybrid workers and fully remote workers as one group and when you compare them to the in person workers they have a similar amount.\nThis makes me wonder if it is truly worth it to get a level of education above a bachelor's degree. The graph shows that there are more workers that have obtained a bachelor's degree than those who received a higher education. \nWithin my community, I believe that most people have a background that contains a college degree of some sort. Other than a majority of high school students, I feel that mostly everyone works somewhere.",

This is particularly striking given that earning a graduate degree typically requires just 18-24 months.\n\n2. I wonder how these trends might differ if the pandemic hadn't occurred. Reflecting on this, I think there would likely be fewer hybrid and fully remote workers, as Covid-19 normalized the idea of working from home for many.\n\n3. This trend somewhat connects to our local community, as certain job sectors here could accommodate remote work.

Somewhat because manual labor requires onsite work, but businesses have kept remote work due to increased cost savings and productivity.\nBut have there been other impacts?  An increased sense of isolation?  An increased divide between the blue and white collar workers that used to interact at businesses?  Young people losing opportunities to build work relationships?\u2028This analysis needs measures such as productivity, mental health, and time.  Nonetheless, this chart will drift to more in-person as companies require days in office, but we will never go back fully.  This new found work-life balance is recognized by even the most hardened CEO.  However, you can\u2019t underestimate the impact of an office.  Interacting in-person connects us and can spark a conversation about a new offering. \nBusinesses will always do what is best for the business, and determine the optimal mix.  The ability to find the best person for a job anywhere in the world and selling and delivering services without T&E have positive impacts.

I can remember when my grandma used to take me and my sister to H-E-B. My grandma hasn't gone into H-E-B in years because she can get her groceries brought out to her car. Simple things like grocery shopping are forever changed. \n  A catchy headline to capture the ideas of this graph is \"Post-Pandemic Society\".",

The graph reflects on my own community as many people who had to go into their workplace to do their job are now able to work at home. I have noticed that this has become a common thing--mostly because the amount of corporate and office jobs have risen, leading to a higher number of remote workers. \n4. \"The Adaptation of Change\"",

This leaves me to wonder if the reason that less people attend school in person is because they are getting older an their lives become busier. After high school people start t live alone and work jobs. This could be a reason that less people are attending school in person. These statistics relate to me and my community by showing a parallel between students attending Nederland High School and students attending Lamar University. I, as a high school student, only attend school on campus. However, my family members that are enrolled at Lamar University take a majority of their classes online. This is due to their responsibilities of being an adult living alone. Work is now more accessible online, so working from home is easier for busy college students.

Most parents work during the weekday, so maybe it was easier for them to drop the kids off at school. Also maybe most kids got vaccinated, so it wasn't such a worry that the kids would get COVID. Thats why some of the college degrees had more hybrid and fully remote people because they probably don't live with their parents.

This can probably be chocked up to the fact that achieving a Graduate degree in any field takes time and dedication, and just working out of high school is much simpler and can usually reap the same rewards.  The second thing I notice is the fact that individuals with college degrees (presumably those who don't have to work in person like blue-collar workers or related careers straight out of high school) have a higher percentage of people who work remotely or in a hybrid manner.  I assume jobs that spawn from collegiate learning most likely offer more opportunity to work with computers, hence the ability to work remotely.\n\nWhat I mainly wonder is if more people have chosen to take up work just out of high school compared to previous years.  I think such a deduction could be made if we were presented with a graph of similar data from previous years.  I cannot assume, however, that such data would conform to my hypothesis.\n\nHow does this relate to my community?  I could apply this same data as an outline to my own graduating class.  It may be possible to assume what percentage of my class will work straight out of high school, continue on to college, or even continue on to high degrees.\n\n\"The Rise of Remoteness : In Person Working Takes a Drop in Popularity\"",

    "comment info": "Based on the graph, I noticed that most workers are in-person especially for the high school or less category even though there are still some workers that are hybrid or fully remote. This depends on whether their work requires hands-on work or not. The workers that studied, and earned their graduate degree or bachelor's degree are more often people that are remote or hybrid. I wonder why the people that have a bachelor\u2019s degree have a larger amount that are fully remote compared to the people that have a graduate degree? This relates to my community because we all went through this pandemic during the year 2020. During the year 2020, most of my neighbors were remote and my parents as well. It is not often to have people fully remote in my community. Now, most people in my community are back in-person.

I also see that workers with Bachelor\u2019s degrees have the most hybrid and remote workers and that workers with high school or less education have the least hybrid and remote workers. \n\tI wonder if and how education level directly correlates to whether or not a person works remotely rather than in person. I also wonder why the second greatest number of remote/hybrid workers come from the category of those with graduate degrees. It\u2019s the smallest category, so that means that the ratio of remote/hybrid workers to in-person workers is the closest to 50-50. I wonder why that\u2019s the case. \n\tThis relates to me and my community because pretty soon I will be looking for a job, so the spread of working remotely may affect me. I may be one of the people who works hybrid or remotely, especially if the trend resulting from the pandemic continues. \nHeadline: Spreading Like a Virus: The Expansion of Remote Work Schedules",

However what stood out to me, is that those with a bachelors degree work more hybrid numerically, but proportionally those with a graduate degree have more hybrid workers and less workers overall. This stands out to me because those with the highest level degree are those that work the least overall. This is interesting because it would be expected to be the opposite, but can be explained by those working blue collar jobs having to work multiple different professions and shifts since they make less on average, than those that already reached a certain level of success and are able to make the most of their leisurely time as well. This graph sparks curiosities about the number of workers that are undocumented and thus not represented in the graph since they are not counted as part of the U.S Census Bureau.

The chart separates people by their background, for the next analysis the relative number of groups will be mentioned not absolute.

We can see that the presence of people working fully remotely is increasing with their education level. The amount of mixed stays is between 75-100% of the fully remote, the mixed percentage also increases with education level. Overall the question that this chart raises is: Why do people who have lower education levels have more percentage working in person; Why do people tend to work remotely; What is the influence of COVID-19 on this? This graph relates to my community, but not that much. This graph is rather general data, meanwhile, the communities that we live in might differ from it pretty high, because depending on people's lifestyles they tend to occupy certain areas that are most suitable for them, so if you are working online and have a high-level degree, there a great chance that most of the people around you, also have a good education and work online.",

So they had to go online and not in person finding ways to work the job from home or a little bit of both. Now once the pandemic rolled over, and people started going back to offices still some noticed that they could work just as good or maybe better from home so there was no real reason to go back into the office if it was suitable for them. However along with the people who had high school or less, they were probably working in places where they did not have the option to do so, forcing them to stay in places where they were before.

    "comment info": "One interesting thing I have noticed about this graphic is the fact that interestingly, Bachelor\u2019s Degree students are the individuals who take the most advantage of online and hybrid commuting options. This fact is fascinating to me in particular because being that I am currently in high-school, and especially due to my generation\u2019s adept use of technology and social platforms, I had assumed wrongly that students between the grades of 7-12 would be the most frequent users of online commuting services/resources. This leads me to wonder, what about a bachelor\u2019s program as well as a student\u2019s life at that age leads to more of an interest in online and hybrid programs? And what is leading to the very minimal difference in online commuting between a bachelor\u2019s degree program and a graduate degree program? This relates to me especially due to the fact that I will soon be going to college, as such it is important for me to better understand the origin of these statistics furthermore so that I may be able to make more well-educated decisions as to what course options suit me best for the caree that I am pursuing. I also believe that this is important information for both junior and senior student\u2019s to acknowledge in their educational journies regardless of their career choice.

Additionally, being that you and I have both asked a very similar question regarding what the differences seem to be between high school and bachlor's program online commuting, I'd love to giev my perspective on a possible answer. I think one possibility for this major difference in online telecommuting could be the fact that many young adults between the ages of 20-25 have jobs outside of their normal education rotation. As such, it could be that it is simply less of a hassel for them to attend classes without having to spend an hour driving back and forth.",
