Similarly, liberals are more likely to identify as L.G.B.T.Q., when compared to moderates and conservatives, by a decent amount.\n    \n    I wonder, while it may not be a large number of respondents as the whole group ranges from ages 18 to 79+, but maybe looking at those still in college would alter the final numbers a bit? From the looks of it, the largest demographic who identify as L.G.B.T.Q. are Gen Z who range from 18-27. The average age to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree is 22-24 years old. So realistically, a large portion of Gen Z is still in school. \n    \n    While this graph does not in any way represent any data on rates of homophobia or the like, I cannot help but see potential correlations with the low identification rates in older generations and the public shaming and violence towards queer individuals I\u2019ve witnessed. If the trend we see in younger age demographics showing higher rates of L.G.B.T.Q. identification continues or even stagnates, I think there is a good chance for change in the future. While any population quickly moving from a small 2 percent minority to a more prominent 23 percent is bound to shake up things, I can only hope it eventually brings about more understanding and acceptance. \n    \n    Shifting Identities: Generational and Ideological Gaps in L.G.B.T.Q.

    "comment info": "The age and political ideology heavily correlate with the likelihood of LGBTQ identification. The older the generation, the lower LGBTQ identification. For example, the silent generation has 2% of LGBTQ identification, whereas generation Z has 23%.  I noticed that 21% of liberals are LGBTQ, whereas 3% of conservatives identify as LGBTQ. I think this graph is getting readers to analyze why there is such a vast difference between LGBTQ identification in political parties and age. For instance, based on my understanding of politics, I know conservatives favor traditional values.Throughout the time of society when the Silent Generation and Baby Boomer generation took place, the traditional values of the United States were not accepting of the LGBTQ community. This provides a possible explanation for why older generations and conservatives are less likely to identify as LGBTQ. It also influences people to decide if the exposure to LGBTQ communities influences kids today to be a part of the community. Or is it acceptance that influences people to be themselves? I wonder if people of earlier ages were less likely to identify as LGBTQ because it wasn't accepted or they weren't exposed to it. This graph relates to me and my community because I have some friends and a cousin who identify as part of the LGBTQ community. I think it is essential to understand how politics and age tie into identification to better understand my peers. \n    Headline: What influences LGBTQ identification today?",

I also noticed that those who identify as LGBTQ+ tend to be more progressive, as they are typically liberal rather than conservative. How truly accurate are the statistics on Generation Z? The context suggests that this graph represents US adults, so how would it change if it also included Gen Z teenagers? Would Gen Z\u2019s percentage of 23% rise or fall? I also wonder if the rise of social media has impacted identification with the LGBTQ+ community. With social media, there has been increased acceptance and education about the LGBTQ+ community, so Gen Z and Millennials may be significantly more likely to identify as LGBTQ+ because they are more likely to be accepted.

I believe that this is because younger generations are more exposed to different possible sexual and gender identities than older generations because of the the spread of information via social media. This logic tracks because millennials, the second youngest generation in this data, have the second highest percentage of LGBTQ identification and the oldest, the Silent Generation, has the lowest percentage. Furthermore, Liberals are more likely to identify as LGBTQ that conservatives. This is likely because the liberal belief system has more favorable policies on gay marriage. Though the percentages are pretty close, the least amount of people identify as LGBTQ in rural areas. This reflects the Ideology section of the graph because most people in rural areas lean conservative. A similar percentage of graduates and non-graduates identify as LGBTQ, suggesting education has little influence on sexual orientation. \n     2.

Similarly, 21% of liberals identify as LGBTQ+ compared to just 3% of conservatives.\n    I wonder if younger generations are more likely to identify this way because they receive greater support from social media, schools, and peer groups. Perhaps older individuals might have identified similarly if they had grown up during a more accepting era.

    "comment info": "Headline: Pride Peaks with Gen Z\n    What do I notice?\n    This graph shows different demographics of U.S. adults and how many identify as LGBTQ. From first looking at this graph, I notice that the age group that most identifies as LGBTQ is Generation Z. The ideology that most identifies as liberal. There isn't a big difference regarding factors like locale or education. As generations get older, fewer identify as LGBTQ, most likely because they tend to hold more conservative views. \n    \n    What do I wonder? \n    I wonder why LGBTQ+ identification might decrease with age. Does LGBTQ acceptance in certain areas or families influence these percentages? Conservatives tend to be less supportive of same-sex marriage, so maybe people whose families are strongly conservative may not say they identify as LGBTQ so they aren't judged. Why might identification rates be similar between college graduates and non-graduates?\n    \n    How does this relate to you and your community?\n    This is related to me and my community because I'm from Generation X and have noticed that people my age are much more open about identifying as LGBTQ. My grandparents are much more conservative and are not as open and accepting of the LGBTQ community. I'm from NJ, which is a liberal state that is near a large city, so more people may identify as LGBTQ.",

It\u2019s pretty amazing that almost a quarter of Gen Z identify as LGBTQ+.  \n    \n    In the coming decade, do you think that the Gen Z percentage who identify as LGBTQ+ will increase, decrease or stay the same?

The biggest differences are by age and ideology\u2014like, 23% of Gen Z identify as LGBTQ+, but only 2% of the Silent Generation do. And when it comes to beliefs, 21% of liberals identify that way compared to just 3% of conservatives. I wonder if younger generations identify more as LGBTQ+ because they have more support from social media, schools, and their peers. Maybe older people would\u2019ve identified more too if they had grown up in a more accepting time. I also wonder if some people still aren\u2019t being fully honest because they don\u2019t feel safe, especially in conservative or rural areas. Family expectations, religion, or fear of judgment could be holding people back. It\u2019s interesting that there\u2019s barely any difference between college grads and non-grads\u2014just 1%\u2014which makes me wonder why education doesn\u2019t seem to affect this much. I\u2019m also curious if these numbers will keep changing in the next few years as society becomes more open.

Second, LGBTQ identification is much more common in those who follow Liberal ideology compared to Conservatives. Finally, this identification is also slightly more prevalent in non college graduates. I am curious how the introduction of social media to newer generations may have impacted these statistics. The biggest difference I can think of between older/newer generations is the access to different forms of media. I also wonder how these graphs will change in this coming year as these statistics came from 2024. I believe they will increase as we can see there has been a slight increase every year these statistics were taken. I also wonder how introducing European/South American countries would impact these statistics? This impacts me because I live near NYC and as the graph explains, there is a high percentage of LGBTQ identification in cities. This graph also shows how more and more people are beginning to identify in the manor and therfore, more groups, protests, and clubs may start popping up to support this growing group.",

As you work back through the generations, the percentage of people who identify as LGBTQ gets less and less. Locale doesn't seem to have an impact and same with education. The percentage of people in cities, suburbs, and rural areas doesn't show a trend in identification. This is the same for education with gradutes or nongraduates.

Like does living in a city and graduating mean more people identify as LGBTQ or are all of these data points separate? I also wonder if the reason for the percentage decreases as the generations get older is because this wasn't an accepted concept then or if there is another maybe biological reason for this shift.

I also noticed that they also mostly live in cities instead of rural/private areas. \n    - What do you wonder?\n    I wonder what specific laws have changed to cause such a high increase in LGBTQ+ percentage, aside from making more open rights.
