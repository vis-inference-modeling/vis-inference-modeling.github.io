Second, it\u2019s clear that although the axis\u2019 change, the US position is still unbelievably higher than all other countries, with the exception of Yemen. In Graph A, I believe it\u2019s showing that more mass shooters come from having more guns, as you can see the US has both the highest number of mass shooters and guns. Even the Philippines has the second highest number of mass shooters but still has the one of the smaller amounts of guns. In Graph B, I think it\u2019s showing the relationship between mass shooters for each 100 million people, and how many guns are owned just over 100 people. As the amount of mass shooters increase, similarly to Graph A, the amount of guns increases as well. Both graphs leave me with the conclusion that the United States is missing something that the rest of these countries \u2013 with the exception of Yemen \u2013 has figured out already.",

We believe this is directly correlated to the loose gun regulation laws here in the U.S. compared to the laws in various other countries around the world. In Graph B we look closely at the ratio of mass shooters to the number of guns per people. In this graph, we were surprised that Yemen along with the U.S. was an outlier as well. We wonder what type of gun laws are enforced in Yemen (if there are any at all) and how they deal with these mass shooters since the number of them is exceedingly large.",

Now I cannot say much on this because i do get enough information but how do we know for sure that the Unites States has this many guns and mass shooters? How do we know that the United States does't have more than that? 300million guns is a lot of ammo. To include more information into our thoughts there should be a lot more on the chart. What exactly are these numbers going by? People? In general? Graph B shows the mass shooters per 100 million people and the guns per 100 people. On this graph it shows that Yemen has the most mass shooters but fewer guns. whereas the United States has less mass shooters but more guns. Now how exactly do we know that this little bit of information given to us is true? Do the countries agree on the numbers that are put with them? Something should be done so that people do not have as many guns but then again you don't really need a gun to kill people. There are different ways someone can get killed. I think it would be safe to address this matter faster than we are at this point because the faster we can work things out there will be a higher possibility of the amount of mass shooters to be lowered. I honestly believe that no one would have ever thought that Yemen had such a high amount of mass shooters. i mean i totally forgot that was even a place.",

So now, what I think that these graphs are trying to show is that it shows on how these mass shootings are increasing in different countries by showing these two graphs and showing the facts that how scary the mass shootings could increase in different times.",

Take Graph A, it tells you that US is obviously a outlier in this graph: more guns, more mass shooters.\nwhile I come from China and I can tell the first lie the main stream media presented to you: the gun is prohibited in China. That is, strictly gun control in China. There should be no guns at people's hand in China! Where comes that multimillion guns in China? You count guns in government's hand?\n\nThen the question is: why China is here?\nThere are two reasonable answers for this question:\n1. it is a lie.\n2. if this is not a lie, then it is total failure of gun control in China.\nDo you really want a useless gun control in US?\nWe all know gun is only a tool for equality, personal freedom and protection. The criminals can use any tools to commit killing. There are so many countries have gun control but their countries kill more people than US. For example, in China, all guns belong to government, but the death by violence in this country is 70000 per year, plus 10000 death penalties from government. Compare to US about 10000 gun violence death in US, which country is more violence?\nPlease don't forget that that regime killed at least 100 million Chinese people after they took office.

If we think of recent incidents, it has caused many to be frightened of not being as safe as possible on a school campus.

In the graph, I also noticed that the United States owns more than 250 million guns. We can infer that because there are more guns in the country, there are more mass shooters. Of course there are other factors involved but that is an obvious observation. For the second graph, I noticed that the higher the population there is in a country, the more guns that are around. Yemen has the most mass shooters yet they own less guns per 100 people but the United States owns more guns and have almost the same amount of mass shooters as Yemen. I do wonder why Yemen has so many mass shooters, of course a graph can show only so much that it can also leave out important information regarding the data showed on the graphs.

I wonder what the laws regarding guns in these countries are like and whether those laws play a part in their location in the graph. The stories these graphs are telling is that the fewer guns a country has, the less likely there are to be mass shooters.",

Though it is easy to see that the U. S. is an outlier with more guns and more mass shooters than any other country on the graph, you wondered about the data.  Which countries were included?  How was the data collected?  How reliable is the data?\n\nThanks to all teachers and students who responded. Since we continue to post responses, whenever they arrive, is there more that you notice?  More that you wonder?  Talk to your classmates and even read the moderators' responses.  See if you can dig even deeper into what the graphs show or not show.   Maybe something you find will lead to more things to notice, wonder, and conjecture.\n\nRemember to check back on Thursday afternoon, March 15 to learn more about these graphs -- and we hope to see you again next month on Tuesday, April 10 (always the second Tuesday of the month) for our next \"What's Going On In This Graph?\" \u2028\u2028\n\nSigning off now -- Sharon in Boston, where we are having our third nor'easter in eleven days, and Annie in Philadelphia.

    "comment info": "I notice the relationship between gun ownership in particular countries with respect to the number of mass shootings. But there's a discrepancy in the data, how the quantitative amount of gun owners doesn't follow through with the  number of mass shootings. Countries like Yemen have less gun holders compared to the United States, although they have more mass shootings. Yemen specifically has a specific political and cultural context to its history with gun use. Yemen is under a civil war between various conflicting factions. Similarly to Afghanistan, there's a disproportionate number of mass shootings, taking in to consideration Afghanistan's population. Like I've mentioned Yemen, there's a political context to what is said about the gun usage. For the US, what comprises most of the mass shootings involves the moral dilemma that lingers the cultural side of the American people. It comprises a cultural backlash, that is disregarded from this statistic. Mass shootings is a very complicated issue, where terrorism, cultural appeal, standards of living, the education of a population, the political intentions of each country, crime rates, etc.. that isn't factored into to the data.",

In some countries, mass shootings may not be directly related to the number of guns, and that seems to be because of how the countries are controlled. Also, the populations are unclear because it is countries from 10 million to 300 million or more people. In middle eastern countries there seems to be no pattern, but in America, both graphs show the number of guns directly leading to the number of mass shootings.

In Graph B, the United States has the most guns per citizen and more mass shootings than any other country besides Yemen. It is unfortunate to see these statistics about what is supposed to be the \"Best country on earth\" or \"The land of the free\". It is scary to think about how one of the top countries on this earth is not safe, and how people live in fear or in depression because of these mass shootings or a loss of a family member in one. These graphs may imply that having these guns, especially in these quantities is not necessary. Something else that could go with this is the types of guns that regular, everyday people own. In other countries, there are laws limiting the types of weaponry that every civilian can own, and by the graphs you can see that they are not nearly close to the U.S in the amount of shooters because of these laws and other actions that their government and society took. I wonder and will always wonder what it will take to finally stop the widespread distribution of these gun. No citizen needs a militarized weapon at their disposal. The answer is laws, but unfortunately no one in government is stepping up and trying to get everyone to agree on the limitations of these weapons. For these mass shootings to stop actions need to be put in place, but how many more shootings will happen before our country realizes.",

I guess what they graph is trying to say is that because of the amount the U.S has, there are more mass shootings. There are more guns than people and this is just outrageous. The U.S stands at the top of the graph having the most guns. I believe this graph is also trying to say that the more guns a country has, a lot more mass shootings occur.",

The United States is on top with Yemen, a place with a dismantled government and Afghanistan, a place that is currently in a war zone. I wonder, how did we get up there? Compare the results with other countries and their results are low. To find the answers to what I wonder, I could read informative articles and read articles that go back in time to before the day we are in today. I feel like there should be more countries involved rather than just a few to actually be able to see the full problem.",

Both graphs depict dozens of countries, similar in population and many other aspects, the United States is an extreme distance from the other countries. These graphs were created to express that extreme problem in this country. The sole purpose was to demonstrate how the United States has managed to separate itself from the rest of the world. Countries that the United States have aided, literally sent troops to in hopes of reforming are obviously better off. How can other countries be improved, if there's more problems at home. This powerhouse of a nation is being beat, statistically destroyed by countries like Afghanistan and Iraq that, demonstrated by the graph, are nowhere near the United States. The fact that these countries are so much safer than the \"home of the free,\" is frightening. How much freedom is to be distributed before the leash becomes too loose and there is no fixing the erupted anarchy. The biggest thing I took away from these graphs is the aspect that these mass shootings, the gun violence, the murders, can be preventable. If dozens of other countries can protect themselves and prevent such incidents, why can't the United States. There are no excuses to be made, the distances in the graph are terrifying and absurd.",

However, these graphs do not depict how many mass shooting were done by those with mental illness, or someone who had taken the gun(s) illegally. Therefore, reducing the amount of guns will not be the sole contribution to make a difference. Gun control needs to be more enforced, along with help for those with mental illness.

In both graphs the US is far right, indicating that they have far more guns in circulation than other countries. The US is also higher up on the graphs, indicating a higher number of mass shootings than all other countries. These two statistics go to show that the US is lenient with their gun laws and that the lack of restrictions comes at the cost of the safety of the masses. In order to join the rest of the countries and have a lower number of mass shootings, the US must have great reform and extremely lower their number of guns.",

The United States, in this case, is found on the far right of the graph and exhibits the exceptional divergence. Graph A is trying to say: the more guns, the more violence. I disagree. Though I do think limiting access to guns would lead to a decrease in gun purchases, I don't think it would have an affect on gun violence. WIth a will comes a way; those intending on harming others will find a way with guns or without guns and will find illegal ways to purchase weapons of their choice.\nGraph B is contradicting the point being made proven in Graph A. America, once again, is leading in gun ownership, though has a much lower rate of mass shooters in comparison to Yemen. This graph is leaning more toward my point of view and is trying to speak on the idea that gun violence doesn't directly correspond with gun ownership. Many other factors come into play.\nThese graphs were created to contradict one another and spark curiosity/controversy.

The United States clearly ranks above most others with the quantity of guns owned and thus mass shooters.  While quantity and ability to acquire firearms appears to be one of the greatest influencing factors, I believe that government policies have the strongest grasp over these situations.  Communist nations such as China have much more restricting policies that limit the possibility for events like mass shootings to occur.  The United States is one of the most developed nations in the world; however, this could potentially create more opportunities for events such as these to occur.  Our democracy continues to have a loose grip over a citizens ability to purchase weapons like guns and continue to even support the process.  How exactly?  Politicians in nearly every state accept funding from the NRA, even after events such as the mass shooting that occurred in Florida recently.",

Although Yemen may have more mass shooters per 100 million people, the US has more then 250 million guns in the country, resulting with more than 80 mass shooters. Gun allowance is shown in the graphs to feed directly to mass shooters in the world, so gun control would seem to benefit the safety of the population the most. A gun ban would be too controversial in the nation's current state, but if the country follows in the footsteps of other countries with low mass shooters and low amount of guns per 100 people, the country will at least be in a better state of safety.",

The US is really the only outlier and its not surprising. I wonder if it depends on how developed a country is for the amount of guns.",

    "comment info": "These graphs actually appear to make the argument that number of guns and number of guns/100 people is not related to the number of mass shootings at all. You have an extreme outlier in the U.S. but other than that it is almost impossible to find any correlation between guns and shootings from the rest of the data. There does not appear to be any trend at all, just random points. Just from eyeballing it and without the actual numbers, it seems a basic regression model of the rest of the world's data would show an almost horizontal line with an extremely low R squared value, indicating that there is almost no relation to guns and shootings, which honestly is a little surprising to me.",

        "comment info": "The number of guns is not the only factor by far; the important factor is gun control, as in \"Who is allowed to own guns?\" Gun control does not mean No guns; it means fostering responsible gun ownership: background checks, training, safe storage, etc. When it's done effectively, you may very well find that a high rate of gun ownership does not generate a high rate of gun related deaths.\n\nThe US is the outlier because it is the one place where any psycho can get pretty much any type of gun at any time. Until responsible gun owners understand that gun control doesn't mean taking guns from them but from unbalanced or disgruntled individuals, the US will likely remain the glaring outlier on such charts. Stay tuned though, we may soon find out if and how arming teachers changes those numbers.",

I wonder why you looked to this graph rather than Graph A -- the number of guns and mass shooters?\nU. S. is an outlier for both guns and mass shooters.  If you look at the graphs with the U. S. included, it seems that that there is an association between guns and mass shooters.  The more guns, the more mass shooters.  You\u2019ve said that if the U. S. is excluded, there seems to be less of a pattern.  Could you explain this more?  I wonder about the selection of countries shown and how this affects the pattern?",

What I get is that while Yemen has fewer guns per thousand they have many more mass shootings.\n\nOverall the United States has many more guns than any country listed it has more mass shootings than most of those countries.  Trying not to editorialize I would surmise that if we followed the other countries and as guns increase in any one of these countries it would indicate a future of more mass shootings and probably more gun violence",
