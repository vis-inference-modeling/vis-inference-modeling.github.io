Graph A shows that there is a lower rate of hospitalizations for both adults and children compared to graph B. \n- I wonder as to why the Adults in the ten least vaccinated states have such a high jump of hospitalizations in months closest to September 6th, 2021. Also, does summer have anything to do with it?\n- This impacts my community because those who are not vaccinated spread the virus and affect the Herd community negatively.\n- \"Will we see the end of COVID?\"",

Because we can't really tell it is the age of 19 adults that goes to the hospital the most or the age of 70 adults. This is also a result of showing how vaccines are effective.

This is because younger kids have a much better immune system than most adults.\n\nI wonder why when people see these stats, and notice that the death rate from the vaccine is extremely low, still decide not to take it. I don't understand that choice and I never will. By not taking the shot, you are pretty much signing yourself up to get the coronavirus. For the people in high vaccinated states, the hospitalization is much lower. This shows us that the vaccine is highly effective and if you want to ensure you and everyone elses safety, you must get.\n\nThis relates to me and my community because people who don't get the vaccine are putting everyone else in danger. Unless everyone gets the vaccine, it probably wont go away. The percentage of getting the virus with a vaccine is around 5%. This means that if not everyone gets the virus, they could still spread it to people who are doing everything they can to ensure their safety and others. If you don't get the vaccine, and then get the virus, because of your choices you may have spread the virus to other people. At this point, getting the vaccine isn't to protect yourself.

Especially in the least vaccinated states. I can see that in the middle of the two graphs, there was the least amount of covid hospital admissions. Also, the number of people who are under 18 had been quite steady in the states with the most vaccinated people. Although in the least vaccinated states, they have the most covid cases under 18 out of the two. When the masks weren't necessary anymore, the cases most likely went up even if some had vaccines.

Often times people who are not vaccinated also don't wear their mask either at all or the right way. This is very dangerous. You can get really sick, and could even die.

This also stems from the leaders in red states, whether it's government officials or business owners, not mandating vaccination.

Although both sides have an increase of hospitalizations recently, it can be seen that the states with the least amount of vaccinations are having more cases of Covid-19.

Relating to my community, this graph represents a neighboring state of mine which can be an accurate representation of how my state may be doing. It's among one of the 10 most vaccinated states in the country, and our vaccination rates are very similar. \nIn this graph, there's a decline of virus cases for adults steadily until about August.

Something that I notice is that the ten most vaccinated states mostly consist of the northeastern states. The south appears to populate the most unvaccinated amount of people. It also appears that the vaccines seem to be working because of this drastic difference in hospitalization numbers. There has been an increase in hospitalizations for adults in both graphs mostly likely because of the new delta variant that has taken the world by storm. Another thing that I can infer is that the people who are 18 and younger are continuing to respond a lot better to the virus than adults. Something that I wonder is truly when this virus is going to get under control. There have been so many waves that the U.S. has gone through with the number of cases but it is so hard to see when this virus will be over. I also wonder why the southern region does not have nearly as many people vaccinated as the northeast. I think that this graph is trying to show that the vaccine truly makes a difference in numbers and decreases the amount of hospitalization. This graph relates to my community because I live in one of the ten most vaccinated states. With that said, people in my area are still getting the virus but compared to other states the numbers are a lot lower.

Instead, the graphs are helping to compare hospitalization rates between those two sets of states for two groups of people\u2014adults and people under the age of 18. \n\nWhen data is collected as a rate, this allows states with large populations to be compared to those with small populations.  \n\nFor example, Arizona and Kansas have about 50% fully vaccinated (seehttps://www.mayoclinic.org/coronavirus-covid-19/vaccine-tracker)  but Arizona\u2019s population is more than double that of Kansas.

I also noticed in the middle of the vaccinated graph   there was a decrease in the number of people hospitalized but the number increased near the end of the graph.  In the unvaccinated graph, there was a huge increase in hospitalization near the end.\n2)I wonder if the increase at the end of both graphs has to do with the people returning back to school.   Does the cold weather in September affect the way people hangout (whether they are inside or outside)?  Did returning back to school cause an increase in hospitalization since many germs are spread?  I also wonder if the people in the hospital had underlying health conditions.\n3)This relates to my community because the coronavirus affects my everyday life.  In school, I have to wear a mask.

Another thing I notice is in both graphs, people under 18 aren't affected as much by covid compared to adults. \n\n2. One thing I wonder is if the vaccine is worth it for people under 18 to get and I also wonder if the covid cases are actually covid cases and not just the flu/cold because the symptoms are so similar. I also wonder why under the graph it says \"Data includes hospital admissions of those with either confirmed or suspected covid-19.\" Do they say this because a majority of the high numbers aren't confirmed cases and they add those numbers in to make people think that the vaccine works?\n\n3.

This seems like it should be obvious to us, but it is evidence to promote vaccination in the lower states. Something we wonder was why the difference in vaccinated people was less in those under 18. The difference in adults with the vaccination rates is pretty staggering, while the difference in kids was far less. We also noticed that there is a curve where there is a spike in hospitalizations and then it goes down.

The top 10 most vaccinated states have fewer hospitalizations than the 10 least vaccinated states. And the graph depicts that the least vaccinated states hospitalization status is only on the rise. I also notice that these graphs contain two different age categories: adults and children under 18. I also notice that children under 18 are much less likely to become hospitalized due to the virus. \n2) I wonder why from may to september, for the vaccinated states, did the number of hospitalizations go down a lot and then raised back up to the same level as may. With vaccinations, shouldn't the numbers of hospitalizations be constantly going down?\n3) This relates to me and my community in many different ways, For one thing, I live in NJ, and as shown in the graph, NJ is one of the ten most vaccinated states. I am also vaccinated, so by the data portrayed in these graphs I hope through my vaccination and a majority of the NJ residents being vaccinated I have a smaller chance of hospitalization due to COVID. \n4) As a headline,  I would name this depiction \"COVID vs. your Community\"",

Rates are also used for population groups, such as here with the larger adults group and the smaller less than 18 year olds.\n\nThough the graph may not give you enough information on whether you should get a vaccine shot, it does show the association between vaccine rates and hospitalizations for two population groups:  adults and under 18 year olds.

I also noticed that the ten most vaccinated states were mostly in the North and the ten least vaccinated states were in the South.\nWhat do I wonder?\nI wonder how accurate these charts are. Underneath the graph, there is a description stating that these records were recorded of those \"with either confirmed or suspected\" covid-19. I wonder why they would put suspected cases because this would make the graph less accurate and not factual. I wonder if the suspected cases are used to help the ten most vaccinated state's hospitalization records look better. \nHow can this relate to my community? \nI relate to this because I live in an area with many highly vaccinated states and I also have experienced Covid difficulties over the past year and a half. \nMy Graph Headline: \nHospitalizations: Do vaccinations make these rates go down?",

In both graphs, the COVID rates were going down before the Delta variant was introduced and both increased from that. \n\n2. What do you wonder?\n\nThe scale of this graph is not super clear and there will always be anti-vaxxers and even statistics don't convince people so what exactly is the purpose of this graph?

Towards the end of the week, adults in the least vaccinated states' covid hospitalizations skyrocketed compared to the under eighteen children. A question I have about these graphs would be why adults in the most vaccinated states actually started with more covid hospitalizations than the least vaccinated states. It is not by much, but it is clear that the adults in the most vaccinated states actually had more covid patients hospitalized. These graphs relate to me, and everyone in the country, for clear reasons. Since the vaccine for COVID-19 has come out, it has been a mission for our country to get as many people as possible vaccinated so we can shorten these long and hard times. Personally, my family and most of my friends are vaccinated so we haven't had any personal issues with covid. This also relates to my school community because we were heavily affected by the pandemic, making school go online, cancelling social events, and creating new rules for everyone. A title for this graph could be, \"Vaccinations affect on Hospitals: Positive or Negative?\" Although it might be simple, it summarizes what these graphs are trying to explain in one sentence.",

In the ten most vaccinated states, the number did drop significantly during the summer months. But compared to the ten least vaccinated states, cases did not significantly increase as summer began to fade. In both graphs however, the number of cases for people under 18 has remained mostly static. \n\nWhat I wonder is why more cases have not appeared in the least vaccinated states for people under 18. I would imagine that they would have more exposure to the virus. \n\nThis relates to me in my community because I live in a state with a high vaccination rate. Despite that, we still have to abide by COVID-19 protocols and guidelines to keep everyone else safe.

In the top of the graph, it states, \"10 new hospital admissions per 100,000 people\". This shows that the graph connects the most vaccinated states, with the amount of people hospitalized from covid. I think this graph compares the amount of people who are vaccinated, including children and adults, and the amount of hospitalizations daily. In our community, Covid is still extremely prevalent. Many people I know are not vaccinated, and have had covid before. I even know people with grandparents who have been hospitalized from covid.

In the ten most vaccinated states, the number of daily hospital admissions experienced a noticible decrease until around mid-Julyish, where said cases increased until around late-August. After that, the number of cases remained somewhat constant. For the kids, the cases remained consistently low throughout May-the first 6 days of September. \n\nIn the ten least vaccinated states, however, the number of Covid cases experience a smaller decrease than the most vaccinated ones, and then starting from late-June to late-August, the states experienced an increase in the rate of Covid cases. One September drew nearer, the number of cases gradually decreased. When it cames to the kids, they experienced a steady increase in the rate of Covid cases throughout the month of August.\n\n2. Why do reporting delays occur in the first place? How much does that affect the data, if at all. \n\n3. My state is mostly vaccinated, and I have not heard any reports of kids here needing to be hospitalized due to Covid. \n\n4.

Coincidentally, both graphs begin to rise in hospital admissions following the beginning of July, however, only the unvaccinated states undergo an intense spike in hospital admissions. Why? Well, I think it has something to do with control.\n Vaccinated people decrease the spread of covid-19. Allowing the vaccinated states more control over the number of sick people and decreasing the spread. That being said, when there's more people who aren't vaccinated the faster covid will spread and the harder it is to manage. I believe that if we want more control we have to reduce the spread, and from what we know from the graph\u2019s results being vaccinated is our ticket to give us that control.

This graph shows the number of CoVid hospitalizations in the 10 most vaccinated and the 10 least vaccinated states.

The states that are in the top 10 for least vaccinated are more southern states and are kind of vacation spots. I wonder if that has something to do with this problem. On the other graph I saw that people in the top 10 most vaccinated are mostly adults but not by much. The amount of people under 18 have not changed at all, but the adults took a big dip right in about July or August. I do wonder if that is because the school year is coming around the corner.

Under the 10 most vaccinated state graph I see  a graph that is showing how many adults and kids under 18 that are vaccinated are being hospitalized. This graph has a less amount of people being hospitalized because of these vaccinations. On the other hand, the graph beside it is showing  the amount of adults and children under 18 that are not vaccinated. This graph has increased throughout covid times. Looking at this graph, I see a major spike of hospitalizations with not vaccinated people. These graphs relate to my own community because we don't have many people vaccinated. Tennessee alone is one of the states that has the least amount of vaccinations. Schools are having to close because of these cases and deaths, and the main cause of this is non vaccinated people. Including my community we have had to close. Many people in our community are against wearing masks, so they get severe cases of covid. Vaccinations can help this.

This meaning, people are needing to get vaccinated or you will have a greater chance of getting hospitalized as an adult. For people under the age of 18, the rate is not nearly as bad, but for adults on the other hand it should be more encouraged for the vaccine.

In the most vaccinated states, the admissions were dropping at a good rate, picked up again, and are going back down, whereas in the most un-vaccinated states, the admissions reached similar lows, but spiked much higher than the other graph. I would theorize that the spikes have to do with the vaccines release causing several mandates to relax, causing cases to spike, and they predictably spiked much higher in highly un-vaccinated communities",

This is because younger kids have a much better immune system than most adults.\n\nI wonder why when people see these stats, and notice that the death rate from the vaccine is extremely low, still decide not to take it. I don't understand that choice and I never will. By not taking the shot, you are pretty much signing yourself up to get the coronavirus. For the people in high vaccinated states, the hospitalization is much lower. This shows us that the vaccine is highly effective and if you want to ensure you and everyone elses safety, you must get.\n\nThis relates to me and my community because people who don't get the vaccine are putting everyone else in danger. Unless everyone gets the vaccine, it probably wont go away. The percentage of getting the virus with a vaccine is around 5%. This means that if not everyone gets the virus, they could still spread it to people who are doing everything they can to ensure their safety and others. If you don't get the vaccine, and then get the virus, because of your choices you may have spread the virus to other people. At this point, getting the vaccine isn't to protect yourself.

I believe this may be due to the fact that mask mandates are not strict anymore. Without the mask or vaccinations, it appears that covid cases in hospitals have gone back up. Especially in the least vaccinated states. I can see that in the middle of the two graphs, there was the least amount of covid hospital admissions. Also, the number of people who are under 18 had been quite steady in the states with the most vaccinated people. Although in the least vaccinated states, they have the most covid cases under 18 out of the two. When the masks weren't necessary anymore, the cases most likely went up even if some had vaccines.

I also, noticed that in the same graph (10 most vaccinated states) the adult line dipped down a lot in the middle of May 1st to September 6th. I wonder if the adults decided to wear masks to feel safe then they didn't want to anymore. Then on the second graph (the least vaccinated states) the daily hospital admissions sky rocketed. I wonder why, maybe because the least vaccinated states weren't getting vaccinated so then the hospital admission went up. I will call this, the Facts about the Vacc (Vaccination).",

Although both sides have an increase of hospitalizations recently, it can be seen that the states with the least amount of vaccinations are having more cases of Covid-19.

Something that I notice is that the ten most vaccinated states mostly consist of the northeastern states. The south appears to populate the most unvaccinated amount of people. It also appears that the vaccines seem to be working because of this drastic difference in hospitalization numbers. There has been an increase in hospitalizations for adults in both graphs mostly likely because of the new delta variant that has taken the world by storm. Another thing that I can infer is that the people who are 18 and younger are continuing to respond a lot better to the virus than adults. Something that I wonder is truly when this virus is going to get under control. There have been so many waves that the U.S. has gone through with the number of cases but it is so hard to see when this virus will be over. I also wonder why the southern region does not have nearly as many people vaccinated as the northeast. I think that this graph is trying to show that the vaccine truly makes a difference in numbers and decreases the amount of hospitalization. This graph relates to my community because I live in one of the ten most vaccinated states. With that said, people in my area are still getting the virus but compared to other states the numbers are a lot lower.

Instead, the graphs are helping to compare hospitalization rates between those two sets of states for two groups of people\u2014adults and people under the age of 18. \n\nWhen data is collected as a rate, this allows states with large populations to be compared to those with small populations.  \n\nFor example, Arizona and Kansas have about 50% fully vaccinated (seehttps://www.mayoclinic.org/coronavirus-covid-19/vaccine-tracker)  but Arizona\u2019s population is more than double that of Kansas.

I noticed that there are some reporting delays near September 6th and how this might affect the data in the graph so that it might be no longer current when the data does come in. Another thing I noticed was that people under 18 are much less likely to be hospitalized because of Covid-19. Even in the states with the least amount of vaccinations they are much less likely to be hospitalized.",

Could it be because Covid does not make children as seriously ill as it does adults? I wonder why both the most and least vaccinated states saw an increase leading to September 2021. Is it because of the delta variant?\n\nThis impacts my community because I live in one of the ten most vaccinated states. This graph shows that even in an area where many people are vaccinated there are still increasing hospitalizations.\n\n\u201cCovid hospitalizations drastically increase for unvaccinated adults\u201d",

Towards the end of the week, adults in the least vaccinated states' covid hospitalizations skyrocketed compared to the under eighteen children. A question I have about these graphs would be why adults in the most vaccinated states actually started with more covid hospitalizations than the least vaccinated states. It is not by much, but it is clear that the adults in the most vaccinated states actually had more covid patients hospitalized. These graphs relate to me, and everyone in the country, for clear reasons. Since the vaccine for COVID-19 has come out, it has been a mission for our country to get as many people as possible vaccinated so we can shorten these long and hard times. Personally, my family and most of my friends are vaccinated so we haven't had any personal issues with covid. This also relates to my school community because we were heavily affected by the pandemic, making school go online, cancelling social events, and creating new rules for everyone. A title for this graph could be, \"Vaccinations affect on Hospitals: Positive or Negative?\" Although it might be simple, it summarizes what these graphs are trying to explain in one sentence.",

In the top of the graph, it states, \"10 new hospital admissions per 100,000 people\".

I think this graph compares the amount of people who are vaccinated, including children and adults, and the amount of hospitalizations daily. In our community, Covid is still extremely prevalent.

In the ten most vaccinated states, the number of daily hospital admissions experienced a noticible decrease until around mid-Julyish, where said cases increased until around late-August.

For the kids, the cases remained consistently low throughout May-the first 6 days of September. \n\nIn the ten least vaccinated states, however, the number of Covid cases experience a smaller decrease than the most vaccinated ones, and then starting from late-June to late-August, the states experienced an increase in the rate of Covid cases. One September drew nearer, the number of cases gradually decreased. When it cames to the kids, they experienced a steady increase in the rate of Covid cases throughout the month of August.\n\n2.

Coincidentally, both graphs begin to rise in hospital admissions following the beginning of July, however, only the unvaccinated states undergo an intense spike in hospital admissions. Why? Well, I think it has something to do with control.\n Vaccinated people decrease the spread of covid-19. Allowing the vaccinated states more control over the number of sick people and decreasing the spread. That being said, when there's more people who aren't vaccinated the faster covid will spread and the harder it is to manage. I believe that if we want more control we have to reduce the spread, and from what we know from the graph\u2019s results being vaccinated is our ticket to give us that control.

On the other graph I saw that people in the top 10 most vaccinated are mostly adults but not by much. The amount of people under 18 have not changed at all, but the adults took a big dip right in about July or August. I do wonder if that is because the school year is coming around the corner.

This graph has a less amount of people being hospitalized because of these vaccinations. On the other hand, the graph beside it is showing  the amount of adults and children under 18 that are not vaccinated. This graph has increased throughout covid times. Looking at this graph, I see a major spike of hospitalizations with not vaccinated people. These graphs relate to my own community because we don't have many people vaccinated. Tennessee alone is one of the states that has the least amount of vaccinations. Schools are having to close because of these cases and deaths, and the main cause of this is non vaccinated people. Including my community we have had to close. Many people in our community are against wearing masks, so they get severe cases of covid. Vaccinations can help this.

The graph that shows the top ten most vaccinated has a significantly lower rate of people going into the hospitals. The graph that shows the ten least vaccinated states shows a very high spike in the adults going into hospitals, while the people under 18 is less of a spike, there is still a decent sized rise. I wonder why the graph that shows the most vaccinated, the adults category goes back up, why is that?

In the most vaccinated states, the admissions were dropping at a good rate, picked up again, and are going back down, whereas in the most un-vaccinated states, the admissions reached similar lows, but spiked much higher than the other graph. I would theorize that the spikes have to do with the vaccines release causing several mandates to relax, causing cases to spike, and they predictably spiked much higher in highly un-vaccinated communities",

But more vaccinated states have less causes in the under 18 category than the lest vaccinated states. It\u2019s actually been mostly even in more vaccinated states. \nWe see a rise in adults mainly. And for less vaccinated states it was a steady clime from July and August. It effected also children too in less vaccinated states in August through September when School starts to pick up again. But adults in more vaccinated states got hit too in the summer time just not as many. It was a gradual clime for adults in more vaccinated states. \n\nWhich states and Policies? Where in what state do they get hit the most? Who is the majority of people not getting effected in the least vaccinated states? Are kids going back to school in the school building in every state? Is more students in more vaccinated states still online/ home schooled? Why are certain states not allowing students under the age of 18 get vaccinated even though it said 18-12 can be? \n \nI am from Oregon and we are still pretty much in lock down. But also we have a little less than a 1/2 of the population vaccinated. Areas in smaller towns and cities are not as effected and are running with more freedom. But still no one under the age of 18 can be vaccinated in Oregon for COVID-19. Many people who are getting sick are now kids thanks to that.\n\nWhy people should be vaccinated, especially under 18",
