In what ways other than fossil fuel emission can we greatly limit the effect of carbon emission and prevent global warming.\n3.

I noticed that while there are only 23 rich countries and nearly 150 others, the smaller rich population accounted for more than half of the CO2 emissions in the world. This explains the idea that wealthier countries are often more industrialized as compared to other countries; therefore, emit higher amounts of CO2 by the build of various factories and industries. \nI wonder how the governments of rich countries will attempt to lower their CO2 emissions and whether or not they plan to replace their nonrenewable resources with fossil fuels. \nThis affects not only my community but the world around me as well.

It is also evident that although it is not considered a rich country, China is the second largest contributor to carbon emissions after the United States, which is considered a rich country.\n2. I wonder if the shocking proportion of historical CO2 emissions to population indicates that big companies from the rich and developed countries are the main proponents of environmentally unsustainable practices, leading to the large scale CO2 release despite only containing 12% of the population.\n3. This relates to my community and I because the United States is the country that contributes most to CO2 emissions in the world. This suggests that Americans should look toward more environmentally mindful practices in their everyday life in an effort to contribute less to CO2 emissions.\n4.

Is it a result of large manufacturing or transportation? Also, to what degree is The United States alone affecting the environment, both locally and globally? \n\nThis relates to my community since I am a U.S. Citizen, residing in the country with the largest carbon emissions, as well as a person living in the world that is affected by these data points.  \n\nA title could be \"Global CO2 Emissions, a Price to Pay\"",

What do you think you've noticed?\nI noted that while the richest countries account for a small percentage of the population, they account for more than half of all CO2 emissions in history. This demonstrates how wealthier countries utilize far more resources despite having a smaller population, and it also reminds me that wealthier countries have greater immunization rates.\n2. What do you want to know?\nI'm curious what we can do to reduce CO2 emissions in these larger countries, and why they don't employ alternatives to high CO2 producers like fossil fuels since they are so wealthy.\n3. How does this affect you and your neighborhood?\nBecause I live in the United States, which has a large CO2 emission, this has an influence on myself and my community.

This is a testament to how wealthier countries use a lot more resources even for a smaller population, and reminds me of how wealthier countries also have higher vaccination rates. \n2. What do you wonder?\nI wonder what we can do to lower our CO2 emissions for these larger countries, and if they are so wealthy why they don't use alternatives to high CO2 producers, like fossil fuels. \n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis impacts me and my community because the United States has a high CO2 emission and that is where I live.

Immediately it is shown that the top 23 developed countries, despite making up 12% of the population, account for 50% of the carbon emissions worldwide. This includes the United States, which leads the emissions in this crisis.\n2. The graph makes me wonder if the United States will actually be able to reduce its carbon emissions. President Biden already stated that he will seek to slash carbon emissions in half by 2030; however, if a Republican candidate takes office, will they revert this policy? Additionally, would the Chinese Communist Party be willing to reduce their emissions for the sake of the planet?. Despite being a \"developing\" nation, the country still boasts the second largest economy and competes with the Untied States. \n3. This relates to my community as New York State plays an important part in the economy of the United States and in turn carbon emissions. Many Long Islanders commute to New York City by car. With the increased traffic in the region, it is clear that our community affects the carbon emissions. \n4. The graph depicts the carbon emissions of the world, splitting countries into two categories, developed and developing countries. The developed countries release 50% of the carbon emissions, despite making a small portion of the population.

If we think about it, over the years there has been an increase in CO2 emissions. In some years, these percentages have doubled. Therefore, I wonder what these percentages will look like in the upcoming years. Also, I wonder if individuals in power will consider these percentages and use their power to try and create a change. \n\n- This relates to my community and me because in the graph we can see that the United States is responsible for one of the highest percentages of CO2 emission compared to the rest of the countries labeled in the graph. As a United States resident, we in part are responsible for CO2 emission, and while it is not our intention to become part of this, we can change things in our daily lives to help minimize these percentages.

One example from the graph is the co2 emission percentage of the US and China. The United states seems to be supporting 23.6% of the carbon emissions, while on the other hand, China aids 13.9% of the co2 emissions. This illustrates that although China has a bigger population than the US, the richer country contributes more co2 emissions than the larger countries, and after researching, I found that this is due to the factories and other carbon-wasting devices that most affluent countries can afford, meaning that rich countries can advance more co2 emissions than the poorer countries because they are able to afford factories and other carbon-wasting things.",

I have never before heard that the United States was contributing such a factor towards ruining our earth, maybe it was kept secret?\nIt is also stunning that countries who farm an insane amount of oil and petrol like Saudi Arabia doesn't contribute much compared to other countries. It is also stunning how the countries with a population of less than 12% of the listed countries contribute more than the other countries, this is a serious problem and these rates need to decrease.",

I noticed that the US specifically makes up 24.6 % of CO2 emissions. \n\nI wonder if CO2 levels are higher in the highly developed countries because there are more issues that have a higher demand to be resolved for instance different forms of transportation and more factories. I wonder why a greater population is able to produce a drastically less amount of CO2 emissions. What are some ways that countries can reduce the amount of CO2 emitted?\n\nThis is important because many people want to live their lives more efficiently without thinking about all of the negative outcomes.
