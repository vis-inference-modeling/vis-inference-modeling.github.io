I noticed that if a student is able to pay off more than the set amount that they are supposed to pay each month, they should do it.

Obviously, if you were to pay off the debt early off, the total value will barely increase; however, if this debt was to be paid off over a long period of time, the total value will increase dramatically.

The colleges charge students a certain expensive amount already (avg. $28,650) and students think that this is the only amount they pay, but if they cannot pay this much right away (most can't) they would have to take up loans, after taking loans, they are charged with interest then students would eventually have to pay an extra thousand or two from their original advertised price. An average amount to pay per mount for a student loan over a 10 yr period is around $300. I feel that students are essentially trapped financially when they decide to go to college. I am not by any means against going to college I just want to discover better and efficient ways of doing so. Rather than paying 300$ a month for some classes you took about 7 years ago and alternative would be to enlist in the military and afterwards the military will completely pay for your college.

    "comment info": "In UC Berkeley, many students if in 10 years term have to pay approximately $276.41 monthly and in total they owe about $33,169, however, in this graph it shows how if you increase the amount you pay monthly, you are able to pay off your debt faster. But it is not that simple because you can\u2019t just increase but a couple dollars, it has to be at least 100 more dollars to meet the curriculum where a student will see themselves able to pay the debt in a short amount of time. One has to increase to pay everything off\n--I wonder how much money a student has to earn at a job that will not only pay his debt monthly but also support them in other occasions and how much money annually will they have to make exactly? It is hard to pay this amount of money because not many jobs are willing to pay a student a lot.",

I find this very ineffective since the interest rate is exceptionally  $4.940. My college pay-off would be done faster yet I would suffer because I would be paying larger amounts at a time while also paying for other bills and utilities.",

But on the downside, I would have to pay almost more than $9000 in interest.\n2. I noticed that the shorter the term is, the lower the interest is. If i wee to spend 2 years paying off my student loans, I would pay $656.87 monthly and $800 in interest, which is more beneficial than paying the $9000 in interest over 20 years.",

The reason as to why I choose this headline is because students should feel more inclined to know everything they possibly can about what they are getting themselves into when they choose to go to college. Whether it is always on the minds of students or rarely ever, college expenses should still pose as a wake-up call for students that have to pay their own monthly payments or rely on their parent(s), that may not have enough money to begin with, to pay for the monthly payments because they are reminded of the sacrifices that were or are made to earn this amount of money to pay off the loans.\n2. I wonder just how skewed the graph will look and the numbers will be if a student decides to spend their money irresponsibly and overtime can barely give away any money towards the monthly payments. For example, what would the graph and numbers look like if the term of the loan was allowed to exceed 30 years?",

My comment to you if you don't mind is that if you were to get a scholarship (not a lot of money) and still get a loan  would you be able to pay this in approximately 5 years and counting the money you spend for other responsibilities you may have? \nI believe loans are a contract where a student is forced to take on 2 part time jobs and take care of their responsibilities such as getting outstanding grades and family just to pay that debt. For me as a high school student is very frustrating to get a scholarship but also be in debt to this type of commitment.
