Over time, we have gotten much closer to attaining equal rights with men and have broken barriers that women back in the 1900s would never have deemed possible. This empowerment has allowed women to attain success in all fields of life, clearly even in running. The running times of women from the early 2000s to now have gotten much smaller and continue to decrease showing the evident capability and strength women have. However, this capability and strength only shines through when women are given the safe space to excel. We continue to get better at that as a society and for that I am proud.",

Some of the factors are if they\u2019re evolving to become better athletes, better training, better mechanics or better  technology to help them improve. I\u2019m also a runner, the only way you get faster is if you train a ton, work on mechanics, and have the right mindset. I believe women are becoming better athletes because they are training a ton and that sports are becoming a social norm in today\u2019s society vs back then.",

I don\u2019t know if this is a result of women simply evolving to become faster, the fact that running has grown on popularity over the years, or a combination of both. As a runner myself, I know that it\u2019s pivotal that the more you run, the faster you get, which allows you to make great improvements over time. Beyond that, as communities of runners run more together, the true team comradery that comes from running really develops.

The dots have steadily increased upwards at a semi-constant rate, there were some outliers but for the most part, the dots were all bunched together.  \n\nWhat I wonder, I wonder why women keep getting faster? Is it because of evolution? Are these women's bodies adapting and getting better traits to run like longer legs/slimmer bodies? And if so are only certain women evolving are those are the ones that are runners.\n\nWhat impact this has on me and my community, well as a woman and as a woman that has women in my community this could be a great thing for us.

There was also a gradual progression in speed as times improved though in 2014 there was a sudden drop in speed before rising gradually again. By 2018 it appears that the lowest times exceeded the average from the years 2000-2012. Other than the leading time from 2006 the top scores have continued to increase. I wonder what these times are taken from, as well as what the increase has been in miles per hour. What I'm curious about is the sudden decrease in 2014 as before that the scores had continued to increase.

This makes me wonder what causes this improvement...does their training change in terms of difficulty? Do they eat or drink something different during the race itself? We may never know the answer, unless we ask these female athletes. Growing up in a family of runners, including myself, I tend to follow in my family's footsteps when it comes to training, eating+sleeping habits, etc. Beyond that, my family has seen great success in this sport, which makes me curious to what point are these women changing their running-related rituals to gain such impressive times. Do they run 3 workouts a week, rather than 2 workouts a week? Do they snack before a run or workout? Again, going back to my previous comment, we will only know the answers if we ask the athlete experiencing the improvements.",

Either way, there is a big difference from 20 years ago which I'm very curious about if it has to do with the work that women put in or the things they use to help them run. When you hear about the fastest runner, you might hear in a couple of years that they no longer are the fastest person. I'm not too sure if this has to do with evolution because that takes a while and it has been only 20 years but it seems to me like Women are running faster by a significant amount.

    "comment info": "We noticed that the average time of the marathoners has consistently decreased, when taking away the outliers. This leads us to believe that the average marathoner has gotten faster over time. We wonder how the marathoners have decreased their times of the years? Are they training differently in order to increase their endurance and stamina? Are they training more or less than before? Is it possible that the advancement in shoe technology has led to the drop in time? Is it possible that they are just healthier overall? 2005-06 seems to have some of the slowest times in the past 20 years, but it also has the fastest singular time. How so, and why is that one time so much quicker than the rest of the times from that year? This topic can impact our community by encouraging people to train and work towards their goals The slowest times each year have gotten faster, but the fastest time from each year don't have any real pattern. In most years, there also seems to be one time/runner who is significantly faster than the rest. Also, the fastest time each year seems to be somewhat consistent every year, hovering around the 2:20:00 to 2:25:00 range. Our title is \"Runners work their socks off to get better\".",

Past 2008, there are no marathon times above 2:45. You can also see that the plots are close together, mostly in clumps. However, as you look at the top of the graph, where the fastest times are located, you can see how spread out they are. I notice that in the graph there is a steady upwards trend which means that the women are continuously getting faster. I wonder what is causing these women to get faster year after year? This impacts our community because it lets us know that humans are getting stronger and faster over time. It also lets us know that our technology involving sports, which can include shoes, gear, and also nutrition, are helping athletes run faster times.

I wonder if the times will eventually plateau, leaving only outliers who drastically improve, or if they will forever increase. Logically speaking, they will have to plateau at some point because it is impossible for a human to run 26 miles in one minute as the constantly improving theory would suggest that they would get to at some point. I also wonder at what point will the speed eventually plateau.

Another thing that really sticks out to me is the outliers in the graph. For almost every year in this graph, there has been at least one woman who has finished at 2:25:00. From looking at the graph I also notice that the most dots for every year seem to range between the 2:40:00 to 2:35:00. I wonder why as the year's progress, the times get faster? Are more women training harder? Is it possible that there have been more opportunities to learn about being healthier and stronger that are resulting in better running times? This has an impact on the community, as when they look and see the increase of female marathoners times increase, it encourages them to strive for a goal and possibly to exceed that. Which could also result in more of an increase of times as the years go on.\n\nHeadline: \"The Upward Rise of the Women's marathon runners increasing dramatically year to year.\"",

This is clear because in 2000, it appears the larger majority of women fell in between 2:45:00 and 2:35:00 whereas in 2018 the large majority of numbers fell in between 2:35:00 and 2:25:00. In comparing these times, I wonder what is the varying age group of these women, what kind of shape are these women in? All of these factors come into play when comparing these numbers. I can infer that as the years went on, training for marathons became more common and available which might be a reason why numbers roughly decreased. Although this does not have an impact on me because I am not a runner, it does impact runners in community looking to make a career out of this exercise.

We can infer that most women who finished under this time were most likely the most experienced runners and had the most training. I as well feel that this graph does not really impact us, however, might impact a women runner viewing this? I see you wonder why so many people finished later but we need to be realistic and realize the average fit female could probably not finish a marathon in under 2:20:00.",

I notice that even though some of the plotted points are not matching with the other plotted points, there looks to be a correlation between the two variables. As the years go by, it seems that the time per mile increases. By looking at the y-axis, I am able to see an improvement in the time and see how the marathon runners are running a longer distance per year.\n\n2. Considering that the graph shows the improvement of runners in a span of 19 years, what I ponder the most is how the marathon runners are increasing their distance and improving the time per mile. Human evolution has improved considerably in the past thousands of years, but how are runners able to improve their distance each year? From 2000 to 2018, the runners were able to drop their time per mile by 20 seconds or more for most runners. Marathon running requires high-intensity training and a crazy endurance level, so I am curious about what methods did the runners use to improve their times.",

I believe that the times are increasing because as the y-axis records the relative time of which the women marathoners finish, the data on this scatter plot just proves that these women are in fact getting faster due to the time shortening throughout the years . Technology is most likely playing a huge role in their gradual increase in speeds where as certain technology can be coming up with things such as needed ingredients in foods or any other consumables that reduce things such as muscle fatigue, and overall improve endurance but it\u2019s also in fact that the women are generally adapting to the marathons and the changing paces of it to suit how they want need to achieve a faster time. So yes, technology is definitely a factor into their improving speeds but it\u2019s also part mental and physical preparation as well.",

More notably, the gap of talent between the slowest and fastest runners has nearly halved from around 25 to 13 minutes. However, the peak times have not increased. The increase in average times is likely due to increased talent scouting and selection (pooling competitors from more countries, cities, etc) as well as a greater understanding of running biomechanics and training modalities. On the other hand, the top runner is roughly consistent with finishing times - meaning that shattering the previously conceived maximum human potential is very difficult. Genetically, these Women have not evolved - but the  level of competition in the event has. \nThis is a shared phenomenon among many sports when the level of human potential is questioned. For example, the average baseball pitch is roughly 10 miles-per-hour faster than it was 20 years ago due to increased training and scouting, but the fastest pitch thrown in history has not changed since 1974.",

If you were to put a straight line going through the graph it would be increasing and linear. This shows that women over the years have been getting faster and faster and have been probably working harder when training for marathons so they can increase their time. The graph shows a lot about the race because the lowest time in 200 was over 2;45 and now its nearly gone over ten minutes approximately clocking in at 2:38.  I wonder why in 2000 the lowest time was below 2:45 and then the next year it went from above 2:45 and then the next year it went back down. That kind of confuses me because in a span of 3 years it went from up-to- down then back to up. This graph definitely has an impact because it shows the grit and perscitence from these athletes and it shows how impressive it is for these women to run a marathon and probably a lot of them have been doing this for multiple years.

This seems to particularly be due to an increase towards the bottom of the spread on the graph.\n2. I can think of some potential causes of this, with the broad overview being an increase in the number of women running marathons overtime. Now, with a growing population, that seems obvious, but I wonder if the rate of change in the running speed might be affected by certain factors relating to women's sports in particular. For example, if most women who would be achieving top marathon times would be in their 20s, did the average speed of women running marathons increase faster than usual during the 90s, when the first generations affected by Title IX and the increasing gender parity in school sports reached that age? How does this correlate with standards of living in general? And what do the averages look like for all women finishing marathons?\n3. It is certainly heartening to see that athletes are getting fitter over time, though I can't say what this means for gender equality without comparing it to the times for men. Broadly speaking, it's a positive trend.\n4. \"Top Women Runners Getting Faster\" (I tried to be catchy without getting less accurate, but it is a bit vague; I don't know how to make the word \"marathon\" catchy).",

I wonder why the outlier times (the very fastest 2-3 times each year) don't follow a similar trend as the average. And what could be causing the increase in the general population, that isn't reflected in the very top runners? \n\nI'm also curious about which dots represent the same women, and what other information could be gleaned if you looked at the trajectories of individual women over time. I'm interested in whether each dot represents a distinct woman or a distinct time (i.e. could the same woman be responsible for multiple dots in the same year?)\n\nI also wonder what this same graph would look like with the 50 fastest men's marathons. \n\n3. This suggests something to me about women's achievement in athletics (we keep getting better and better over time!) and makes me excited about the future of women athletes. Growth is achievable, and the graph encourages me to have patience with myself and my communities, because these marathoners' growth occurred over decades.\n\n4.

If you drew a line along the bottom of the graph, it would be a linear, increasing line. The line would start near 2:45:00 in 2000 and end near 2:35:00 in 2019. Which means, the runners decreased their finish time by approximately 10 minutes between those years. There are many outliers near 2:20:00 and the faster times. Specifically at 2012, you can see a major gap between 2:45:00 and about 2:37:00. There were no times above 2:37:00 for 2012. I wonder what occurred that year that created a significant difference in finish times. What did the runners do in preparation to peak in that year? Personally, viewing this graph is inspirational. This shows a major achievement for women and their extreme dedication and resilience. It is incredible that these women have continued to participate in marathons throughout 19 years. That is unbelievable perseverance and commitment. The traits that these women have are some that I value in my own life and wish to develop for the future. Everyone should use this as an example in their life and think about these individuals when things become difficult. A headline that relates to the graph is \"Fast Times for Long Distances\".",

The line of best fit is definitely increasing, leading me to believe that the marathoners are indeed growing faster as time goes on.\n2. That said, the first question that pops into my head is, \"How?\" How do the marathoners increase their stamina and speed so drastically? Evidently, practice does make them better, but this is a great piece of evidence to show HOW MUCH practice can improve on a baseline speed.\n3. This helps me realize that just by continuing to push yourself, you can increase your skills exponentially over a given period of time. It shows that while some of the marathon runners increase at different paces, over time it ultimately leads to them becoming better versions of themselves. This can be applied to anything, really: academics, sports, art, music, etc.\n4. A catchy headline could be: \"Marathoners Make a Move: Practice Really Does Make Perfect.\"",
