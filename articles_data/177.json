The graph is telling us the progress these tennis players have made beginning as early as age 13. \n\nSteffi Graf was the most successful athlete at age 20 and then again at age 25. She is the youngest athlete, however she has the third most Grand Slam Titles. \n\nMargaret Court has the most Grand Slam Titles at age 31. She also had a 2-3 year stretch until age 25 where she does not win any titles. \n\nAfter looking at the graph, we wonder what factors would cause certain athletes to fall behind the others.

The graph tells us how many Grand Slam Titles some tennis players have won, Margaret Court having the most by the end of her career and Martina Navratilova having the fewest. We wonder when serena Williams had started her career because it seems to have been covered by Steffi Graf's and Margaret Court's information. We also wonder if the circles on the graph represent the end of their careers. A title for this graph could be \"Grand Slam Tennis Women\"",

Likewise, the slopes on the graphs are lower when they're younger because they're less experienced and perhaps not fully developed physically to compete with the athletes in their prime just yet. \n\nI wonder why the lines in the graphs differ in terms of when they stop in their age.

Also, that none of the lines are straight or are in a pattern sometimes athletes have a bad game day and it can mess up everything. I also wonder how old these athletes are now because they could still win another Grand Slam title in the future or if they are too old to. If I could give it another name it would be Grand Slam Glory or Don't Put an Age on Champions. I decided on Grad Slam Glory because these are the athletes that have won the most Grand Slams, I also picked Don't Put an Age of Champions because some of the people that have the most titles are the older athlete but some of the younger athletes have a lot too.",

As the players age, they earn more titles, and it's likely that no player would lose a grand slam title as they get older. It's a fair assumption that each player will increase in titles as they get older- the question is, how quickly? And when do they start? Ultimately, I feel the graph is comparing the rate in which these players earned their titles, and adopts the line graph for added information as to the age the award was received.",

Likewise, the slopes on the graphs are lower when they're younger because they're less experienced and perhaps not fully developed physically to compete with the athletes in their prime just yet. \n\nI wonder why the lines in the graphs differ in terms of when they stop in their age. I imagine this is because of the age differences of when they started vs when they retired, but wouldn't it make more sense to have it cut off all at once to make things easier to compare? \n\nTitle: Age vs Number of Grand Slam Titles Won",

Throughout the dataset, the lines slowly curved up and to the right, suggesting that the players won more titles as they got older. This also suggests that the players gained experience as they kept playing Tennis and became more successful because of the amount of time devoted to the sport.\n2. I wonder if, at some point when the players become physically too old to play as well as they did in their younger ages, the lines will eventually take a sharp turn downward or if the lines will continue to rise up.\n3.

However it can be concluded that there is there is a faster rate of increase for all players between the age of 18 and 25. I wonder if these ages could potentially be the peaks of their athletic careers? We also notice that players plateau at around the same times. For example, Margaret Court and Serena Williams (although for different amounts of time) both had a few years were they were left at around 13 wins and did not advance. \n\nAge also does not play a role in how well they do, because Margaret Court (about 31 years old) has won 24 titles while Martina Navratilova (about 33) only has 18.",

Meaning that those that won Grand Slams only a few years after the age of 15 went on to win many more, they did not just peak young and never win any more Grand Slams.  After looking at this graph I am wondering if there are any examples of tennis players who won a Grand Slam at a young age and then went on to win no more Grand Slams as they progressed in there career.",

However it can be concluded that there is there is a faster rate of increase for all players between the age of 18 and 25. I wonder if these ages could potentially be the peaks of their athletic careers? We also notice that players plateau at around the same times. For example, Margaret Court and Serena Williams (although for different amounts of time) both had a few years were they were left at around 13 wins and did not advance. \n\nAge also does not play a role in how well they do, because Margaret Court (about 31 years old) has won 24 titles while Martina Navratilova (about 33) only has 18.",

This is most easily viewed on Martina Navratilova's line, specifically ages 22-24. She won a title at age 22, did not win at 23, and won again at 24. This same sequence is visible on Margaret Court's line. She won at 23, did not win at 24, and one at 25. Another thing I noticed was that winning titles does not necessarily mean an increase in the slope of the line until it breaks one of the cumulative thresholds.",

Margaret takes the titles!\"\n\nWhat we notice?\nThe 3 highest titles (Steffi Graf, Margaret Court, and Serena Williams) all began their \"Grand Slam Titles\" journey at the same age. It is not uncommon to view a span of 2 years with no \"Grand Slam Title\" to be achieved.\n\nWhat we think the graph is telling us?\nThe \"Grand Slam Titles\" achieved are fairly close in relation to the other female professional tennis players in the tournaments.\n\nWhat we wonder?\nIf these players careers continuing or have they all retired from the sport itself",

However it can be concluded that there is there is a faster rate of increase for all players between the age of 18 and 25. I wonder if these ages could potentially be the peaks of their athletic careers? We also notice that players plateau at around the same times. For example, Margaret Court and Serena Williams (although for different amounts of time) both had a few years were they were left at around 13 wins and did not advance. \n\nAge also does not play a role in how well they do, because Margaret Court (about 31 years old) has won 24 titles while Martina Navratilova (about 33) only has 18.",

However it can be concluded that there is there is a faster rate of increase for all players between the age of 18 and 25. I wonder if these ages could potentially be the peaks of their athletic careers? We also notice that players plateau at around the same times. For example, Margaret Court and Serena Williams (although for different amounts of time) both had a few years were they were left at around 13 wins and did not advance. \n\nAge also does not play a role in how well they do, because Margaret Court (about 31 years old) has won 24 titles while Martina Navratilova (about 33) only has 18.",

What do the graphs for the other women who have a \"flat segment\" at 0 titles tell us that doesn't seem to be true for Serena? How can we check that hypothesis? I hope you have a chance to tell us what you think about this.",

Likewise, the slopes on the graphs are lower when they're younger because they're less experienced and perhaps not fully developed physically to compete with the athletes in their prime just yet. \n\nI wonder why the lines in the graphs differ in terms of when they stop in their age.

I have already read how good and skilled Serena Williams is at tennis but Margaret Court has won one more title than her. I'm wondering why her performance isn't going so well. There have been 2-3 years where some of the women haven't won titles. I'm guessing its their performance and what they do different in each match that is affecting them to win or lose.",

This is shown by the slopes of the lines being very sharp. I also noticed that there are usually some times of stagnancy when a player does not win a title in a few years, though this stagnancy appears at various ages across these players. I think the graph is telling us the amount of grand slam titles tennis players have achieved as they grew older. I wonder what the graphs of less accomplished tennis players with around 10-15 titles would look like. Catchy title: How does age affect these tennis allstars?",

(How?) <-- Perhaps first game, first win. (My assumption.) \nHeading toward another player, there is a part where Margaret Court sort of win and win, repeatedly until age 23 to 25. Perhaps something happens? \nGoing forward with more information, looking at age in correspondance to \"Grand Slam Titles\" held, more time in the \"age\" meant more win.

Likewise, the slopes on the graphs are lower when they're younger because they're less experienced and perhaps not fully developed physically to compete with the athletes in their prime just yet. \n\nI wonder why the lines in the graphs differ in terms of when they stop in their age. I imagine this is because of the age differences of when they started vs when they retired, but wouldn't it make more sense to have it cut off all at once to make things easier to compare? \n\nTitle: Age vs Number of Grand Slam Titles Won",

We also noticed that Margaret Court has passed up Serena Williams in her number of grand slam titles, from 23 to 24 titles. What made these players want to start playing young, and what was their motivation? We also wondered why and how their winning streak became more and more intense over the years, causing them to get as successful as they are. A good title for this graph would be \"Professional Women's Tennis Players Age vs. # of Titles.",

As the players age, they earn more titles, and it's likely that no player would lose a grand slam title as they get older. It's a fair assumption that each player will increase in titles as they get older- the question is, how quickly? And when do they start? Ultimately, I feel the graph is comparing the rate in which these players earned their titles, and adopts the line graph for added information as to the age the award was received.",

This is not number of titles for each age, but ....

Likewise, the slopes on the graphs are lower when they're younger because they're less experienced and perhaps not fully developed physically to compete with the athletes in their prime just yet. \n\nI wonder why the lines in the graphs differ in terms of when they stop in their age. I imagine this is because of the age differences of when they started vs when they retired, but wouldn't it make more sense to have it cut off all at once to make things easier to compare? \n\nTitle: Age vs Number of Grand Slam Titles Won",

This is not number of titles for each age, but ....  Take a look above the graph. \n How many Grand Slam tournaments are there per year?  \n\nPersonally, I find it difficult to see clusters or outliers because of the lines.  With the lines, this is not a scatterplot, so we don't talk about clusters or outliers. \n Why do you think the lines are here?  What do they help you see?\n\nLet us know what you now think.

However it can be concluded that there is there is a faster rate of increase for all players between the age of 18 and 25. I wonder if these ages could potentially be the peaks of their athletic careers? We also notice that players plateau at around the same times. For example, Margaret Court and Serena Williams (although for different amounts of time) both had a few years were they were left at around 13 wins and did not advance. \n\nAge also does not play a role in how well they do, because Margaret Court (about 31 years old) has won 24 titles while Martina Navratilova (about 33) only has 18.",

What do the graphs for the other women who have a \"flat segment\" at 0 titles tell us that doesn't seem to be true for Serena? How can we check that hypothesis? I hope you have a chance to tell us what you think about this.",

Likewise, the slopes on the graphs are lower when they're younger because they're less experienced and perhaps not fully developed physically to compete with the athletes in their prime just yet. \n\nI wonder why the lines in the graphs differ in terms of when they stop in their age.

We also wonder if the circles on the graph represent the end of their careers. A title for this graph could be \"Grand Slam Tennis Women\"",

This is shown by the slopes of the lines being very sharp. I also noticed that there are usually some times of stagnancy when a player does not win a title in a few years, though this stagnancy appears at various ages across these players.

Likewise, the slopes on the graphs are lower when they're younger because they're less experienced and perhaps not fully developed physically to compete with the athletes in their prime just yet. \n\nI wonder why the lines in the graphs differ in terms of when they stop in their age.

Including, Wimbledon, the United States Open, the French Open and the Australian Open. I noticed that most of the tennis players started playing when they were younger. Starting off they did not gain as many titles as they have when they got older. Margaret Court has won the most titles and has more than Serna Williams has at a younger age. Some lines start earlier than others and they begin to rise after they start playing. I wonder how difficult these grand slam titles are to uphold?",

As the players age, they earn more titles, and it's likely that no player would lose a grand slam title as they get older. It's a fair assumption that each player will increase in titles as they get older- the question is, how quickly? And when do they start? Ultimately, I feel the graph is comparing the rate in which these players earned their titles, and adopts the line graph for added information as to the age the award was received.",

This graph as a whole tells us the progression of how many titles each woman has won throughout her lifetime of playing tennis.  When looking at the graph, I wonder when the women's numbers of Grand Slam Titles will come to a stop (like at what number of titles will the women either retire or stop winning them) and if their receiving the titles would slow down to a stop or just completely stop.  A headline for this graph could be \"Progression of the Best Female Professional Tennis Players.\"",

Likewise, the slopes on the graphs are lower when they're younger because they're less experienced and perhaps not fully developed physically to compete with the athletes in their prime just yet. \n\nI wonder why the lines in the graphs differ in terms of when they stop in their age. I imagine this is because of the age differences of when they started vs when they retired, but wouldn't it make more sense to have it cut off all at once to make things easier to compare? \n\nTitle: Age vs Number of Grand Slam Titles Won",

However it can be concluded that there is there is a faster rate of increase for all players between the age of 18 and 25. I wonder if these ages could potentially be the peaks of their athletic careers? We also notice that players plateau at around the same times. For example, Margaret Court and Serena Williams (although for different amounts of time) both had a few years were they were left at around 13 wins and did not advance. \n\nAge also does not play a role in how well they do, because Margaret Court (about 31 years old) has won 24 titles while Martina Navratilova (about 33) only has 18.",

Meaning that those that won Grand Slams only a few years after the age of 15 went on to win many more, they did not just peak young and never win any more Grand Slams.  After looking at this graph I am wondering if there are any examples of tennis players who won a Grand Slam at a young age and then went on to win no more Grand Slams as they progressed in there career.",

As the players age, they earn more titles, and it's likely that no player would lose a grand slam title as they get older. It's a fair assumption that each player will increase in titles as they get older- the question is, how quickly? And when do they start? Ultimately, I feel the graph is comparing the rate in which these players earned their titles, and adopts the line graph for added information as to the age the award was received.",

If the line is horizontal between 23 and 25 for Margaret Court, what could that mean?\n\nSteffi Graf is amazing.  Why?  How does this fit with your title?",

This is not number of titles for each age, but ....  Take a look above the graph. \n How many Grand Slam tournaments are there per year?  \n\nPersonally, I find it difficult to see clusters or outliers because of the lines.  With the lines, this is not a scatterplot, so we don't talk about clusters or outliers. \n Why do you think the lines are here?  What do they help you see?\n\nLet us know what you now think.

Steffi Graf is also the youngest, but has a competitive number of Grand Slam titles with the older players. Martina Navratilova, from 25-30, continuously won titles but has plateaued with her winnings. \n\nWe think the graph is telling us that regardless of age, individuals can succeed in an intense setting. However, we also can recognize that age can be a hindrance to one's athletic career, seen by the decline in winnings by some, but not all, of the older athletes. \n\nWe are still curious about how age plays a role in athletes' success because some of the competitors seem to be affected by it while others do not.

For example, Margaret Court and Serena Williams (although for different amounts of time) both had a few years were they were left at around 13 wins and did not advance. \n\nAge also does not play a role in how well they do, because Margaret Court (about 31 years old) has won 24 titles while Martina Navratilova (about 33) only has 18.",

For example Margaret Court has 24 titles at the age of 31 as opposed to one such as steffi graf who has 22 titles at an age younger than 31. The graph is trying to show us the correlation between age and number of grand slam titles for professional women's tennis. So based on this how does one classify a good player?

The graph tells us how many Grand Slam Titles some tennis players have won, Margaret Court having the most by the end of her career and Martina Navratilova having the fewest.

Likewise, the slopes on the graphs are lower when they're younger because they're less experienced and perhaps not fully developed physically to compete with the athletes in their prime just yet. \n\nI wonder why the lines in the graphs differ in terms of when they stop in their age.

With one title each year, the title of Grand Slam is... Well... champion.\nHeading toward the Statistic part of this graph. We can see that Serena William start off at 1. (How?) <-- Perhaps first game, first win. (My assumption.) \nHeading toward another player, there is a part where Margaret Court sort of win and win, repeatedly until age 23 to 25. Perhaps something happens? \nGoing forward with more information, looking at age in correspondance to \"Grand Slam Titles\" held, more time in the \"age\" meant more win. (Simply put, I exert that being in the league or playing more gave you more chance of victory, compared of those who just recently started.) \n(Of course, that may be false due to Margaret Court at 32,24 to oldest Serena Williams at 35,23.\nBut meh....",

Likewise, the slopes on the graphs are lower when they're younger because they're less experienced and perhaps not fully developed physically to compete with the athletes in their prime just yet. \n\nI wonder why the lines in the graphs differ in terms of when they stop in their age.

Throughout the dataset, the lines slowly curved up and to the right, suggesting that the players won more titles as they got older. This also suggests that the players gained experience as they kept playing Tennis and became more successful because of the amount of time devoted to the sport.\n2.

In this graph, you can see the difference between when these players first won a Grand Slam Title, and how many they won over all. The players on the graph are Steffi Graf, Chris Evert, Margaret Court, Serena Williams, Helen Wills, and Martina Navratilova, who are all women. I wonder in what year all of these Grand Slam Titles were won. One title for this graph could be \"Women's Grand Slam Titles by Age\".",

It is interesting to see the pattern is more victories/titles as each woman got older; there are some flat lines which indicate no change/advancements, but there were not any significant decreases in the graph. It is unusual to think that an athlete gets better as he/she gets older, but because experience generally increases with age, it is logical that these women got more experienced and skilled as they continued to play professional tennis over the years.(leading to their victories depicted in the graph)",
