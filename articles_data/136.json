I wonder what this would look like in my town, would it be close to this or totally different? I also wonder if these families are doing okay without a job or are they suffering? This impacts my community because without people working then we won't have an economy, we won't be able to have work experience because everybody working there might not be there, meaning the people who would teach the newcomers wouldn't be able to, and we won't be able to obtain or buy items. What's basically going on in this graph is it telling us the countries unemployment during the pandemic, there are 5 different categories, Not in the labor force but wants a job, Total unemployed, Temporarily laid off, Permanently laid off, and other. These all are things that are happening due to the pandemic that's going around right now. A catchy name I came up with for this graph to be named is \"Unemployment mountains\" I choose this because if you look at the graph they kinda look like cliff sides of a mountain, this tells the reader one we're not doing the best and we're trying to get the reader to read or look at this graph so they know what's happening and with a catchy name they will!",

On the sides of the graph it says what months this is happening in and how many people there are within that month. Although this graph is laid out weird I definitely believe it corresponds with Covid. Number of people unemployed and laid off in January was 12 million which seems fairly normal and then the next month it shows April it spiked to 32 million people. This showed that more people got temporarily laid off, permanently laid off, and not in the labor force but want a job through the pandemic. As it shows in April the number of people spiked to 32 million and that is right after March when the coronavirus hit us and everything happened. I Believe the composition of employment did change throughout the United States and will probably change us for a while until the coronavirus is completely over. I noticed that the Number of people unemployed has gone down since April which is very good. I wonder if our unemployment rate will ever get down to as low as it was. Knowing someone who lost their job I can say it does have a big impact on the people around me as they lost their income to provide for their family.

There is a large surge in unemployment in the month of April, and this is most likely due to COVID. many were temporarily laid off, and it seems as they're rehired at a further date. I wonder if the people not in labor who wanted labor got a job and closed the amount of unemployed people. How has this effected the economy?",

Before covid, the economy was at an all time high with lower unemployment rates than normal. While numbers of unemployment peaked in April and the months during covid, it is clear that numbers are starting to go as during April it was at 32 million and in September 19 million which is a very good sign. I wonder why in January the total number of unemployed and not in a labor force but want a job seem about the same number. Only a small portion of the total unemployment was temporarily laid off or permanently which makes me question what the other was for?\nThis impacts my community because if unemployment rates begin to rise again, that means my friends and family could potentially lose their jobs. \nNew Headline-\"COVID Strikes, Jobs are Lost\"",

One good example of this is bike sales were way up in COVID 19 yet money made off of public transportation was down. If a lot of people are unemployed that means there will be less places to buy things that you need. People will eventually lose money, not be able to pay bills, have no food and be homeless having homeless shelters fill then someone might catch COVID, and infect the shelter.\n\nHeadline\n2020 Unemployment in the US During Times of the Virus",

It seems like in the beginning of sept that many people were employed, but due to the pandemic, seems like people lost their jobs, to they are looking for one to have to afford things like food. You can definitely tell people are feeling a little more safe and willing to get a job and the number has risen.\n\nI wonder where this data was taken? What was the result in the lose of jobs? If this in different regions of the US, that may had fewer cases?  \n\nWell for people who needs a sustainable income its important for them. We live in a not a wealthy area and a lot of people rely on the bigger company's to, and a lot of those closed due to the Pandemic, they will begin to suffer their and the family and also small s.

People who haven\u2019t actively sought work in the last four weeks, even if they want jobs, are considered out of the labor force and are not counted. So, both groups tend to still \"want\" jobs, which is why both are shown here.\n\nI love this wondering: \"I wonder if the graph would be a lot different if there wasn't the ongoing pandemic among society.\" What made you believe the pandemic affected the shape of this graph?

I wonder how the graph would've looked if this pandemic wasn't going on, also how it's going to look in the next few years. This definitely has a great impact in our community since it determines how many people have jobs which can greatly affect their lives. Also this can affect our economy knowing that many people have been unemployed. A catchy headline can be \"The impacts COVID had on jobs\".",

In January, COVID-19 was not as big or known but many people chose to leave their jobs or had temporary jobs in January.

I think that this is like that because many jobs and businesses were hoping that people can come back and work.\n   I wonder why more people chose to leave their job back in January verses in March when most people were trying to stay safe. I also wonder why there are more people that were already unemployed but wanted a job in April more than they do now.\n  This affects my community because the graph shows just how many people were laid off due to COVID-19.

        "comment info": "@Abednego O \n\nGreat noticing. It's helpful to know when graphics make unnecessary distinctions or necessary distinctions between groups.\n\nOne piece of info that may help clarify: The government's definition of \"unemployment\" only counts those who are temporarily laid off or who have looked for work in the past four weeks. People who haven\u2019t actively sought work in the last four weeks, even if they want jobs, are considered out of the labor force and are not counted. Since both groups still \"want\" jobs, both are shown here. In the full release, you'll see graphics that break down both groups in further detail.\n\nThank you for also sharing how this may impact the community. Some further questions: What other consequences may there be unemployment? How might we measure those consequences and see if they are actually caused by increasing unemployment (or by other factors)? Would love to hear your thoughts!",
