Some of the axes/labels are small, and the colour differences are subtle, which slows my comparison between groups. I would have chosen one strong \u201chighlight\u201d colour to draw attention to the key data point and made the secondary data a lighter shade. That way the audience sees the main insight quicker. Overall though, the layout is clean and the visual gives a good overview of the change over time.",

This is because in 2019, 3 movies from very famous franchises came out like Marvel Endgame, Toy Story 4 and Lion King. These are some very famous movies, they all made tons of money and beyond that they were rated highly by critics. There is a significant drop from each year to the next because many of the recent movies are just remakes or sequels. One movie stuck out to me as particularly bad: Inside Out 2. This was the worst sequel to a movie I have watched. The plow line was awful, the characters were not interesting, and it was much different than the first one. Many of the sequels Disney have been producing have been poor quality and that is probably why there has been a drop off in revenue.",

It\u2019s possible that people grew even more attached to their short form of video content (like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram) during that period of time, as that was a major form of communication and interaction when isolated in our residence. Now being conditioned to depend on these Shorts and Reels, the general interest in movies decreased. This is my prediction of why we see the patterns we do in this graph.",

I am curious about the reasons behind this drastic decline. Could it be that fewer people are going to theaters or paying for movies as they once did? Is it due to a loss of interest or the rise of pirating websites? Perhaps it is related to dissatisfaction with current movie releases, as many recent films have not resonated well with the public. Is this a result of a lack of appreciation for the subject matter, or do audiences simply want to see different types of content? It\u2019s also possible that people are watching fewer movies overall. This situation impacts my family and friends because we often discuss our favorite and least favorite films.

From 2019 to 2025 the numbers in revenue have gone down by a lot. I\u2019m assuming that the pandemic may have had something to do with this. Since the cost of living is on the rise people have no time to watch movies because they\u2019re busy working to make money so they can at least afford their basic needs.

The amounts went down a bit each year after that, with 2025 being the lowest at only $1.6 billion. Almost all of the most popular movies are sequels or superhero films from Disney and Marvel. I wonder why 2025 made so much less money than previous years. Were there just not as many good movies? Are people choosing to watch movies at home on streaming services instead of going to the theater? This graph makes sense to me because I only go to the movies once or twice a summer at most.

I also notice that the graph shows the movie poster larger depending on how much revenue it brought it. \nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder what the reason for the movie revenue decreasing is; if people have stopped going out to the movies as much, or if the revenue decrease has to do with poor marketing for the movies. The revenue decrease could also have to do with the fact that movies are more expensive to make now than they were 5 years ago. \nHow do your own summer moviegoing habits, and those of your friends and family, relate to this graph?\nMy own summer moviegoing habits relate to this because when I was younger, me and my family would go out to the movies much more often. Now that me and my siblings are older, we are busier with sports and extracurriculars so we don\u2019t go to the movies often.

Secondly, I noticed that the total revenue from these movies has also gone down. I wonder why movies in 2019 made more money than movies today do.

It appears that 2019 earned the most revenue off of the movies and 2025 made the least amount of money. The movies in 2019 all seem to be Disney or Pixar related which makes me wonder if that's the reason they do the best. This thought continues when looking at 2025 which the movies seem to be sequels to previous movies. This makes sense because most often the first movie is liked more than the continuing movies. It is interesting because even though 2019 is the most popular I have not seen any of those specific movies released that summer.

There is a gap and the graph excludes 2020 and 2021. This is most likely because these years were during the Covid Pandemic and the movie industry was taking a toll. No one was going to see movies in the movie theater. Besides this outlier, as the years go on, the amount of money and movies decreases. \n\nI wonder what factors contributed to the decline of movies produced and the amount of money made each year. Maybe it is because of the changes in each generation. Many people prefer to watch movies at home. Also maybe the new movies coming out were not as interesting or didn\u2019t get as much attention as the movies from 2019.\n\nI definitely go to movie theaters to watch movies less than I used to. My family and I usually wait for movies to come out on our TV. I\u2019m sure many people can relate.

Could it be due to the rise of Online Streaming Services like Amazon Prime and Disney+?\n\nHow Does This Relate to You and Your Community?: This relates to my community because many people within my town watch movies in theaters and frequently talk about recently coming out movies.

Something that called out to me was the fact that in 2025; when all movies were action/live, no one really went to watch, compared to prior years when people went to see live action movies and animated as well. I also notice how each movie poster has a different size to them. Majority of these movies are either remakes or sequels. \n\nWhat do I wonder?\n\nI wonder why the year 2025 did bad in revenue compared to prior years. What made people this year not want to see movies in theaters? Does this affect filming directors and their ability to make better movies in the upcoming year ? Why are the movie posters different sizes?; do they each represent revenue? \n\nHow do your own summer moviegoing habits, and those of your friends and family, relate to this graph?\n\nBefore the year 2025, movies generally looked interesting and fun. But once 2025 hit, the list of remakes made movies seem boring (at least imo) because people already know the plot. I've also noticed that throughout the years, it seems easier to stream these movies on streaming services you can pay for monthly rather than spending that money on a single movie for 1 day. I'd rather spend 15$ for a streaming app that gives me all these movies combined to watch, rather than pay 15$ for 1 movie when it comes out.  \nCatchy title:\nBox office blues: The diminishing revenue for summer movies from 2019 to 2025",

Perhaps fewer blockbusters were released in 2025, which is another reason why it is so much lower.

I\u2019ve noticed that the larger the cover of the movie is, represents the amount of money that was brought in from it.

I suspect this is due to COVID-19. I also notice that some movies have larger bars than others. \n\nI wonder if the size of the bars correlates with how much money each movie made, and if the movies with larger bars are the ones that made the most money. I think this because the movies with the larger bars are some of the movies I remember being very popular, such as Barbie, Top Gun, and Inside Out 2. I wonder if this decline is due to an increase in people streaming movies at home rather than going to the movie theaters. \n\nMy own summer moviegoing habits relate to this graph in that I saw two of the movies with the largest bars in theaters during the summer, those movies are Barbie (2023) and Inside Out 2 (2024). I also think that the number of times I go to the cinema each year has been on a continuous decline. I think that nowadays many people just wait until movies come out on streaming services because it is more convenient to watch a film at home.",

I also notice that the movies displayed on the graph are mostly geared towards younger kids. Most are either animated or apart of the Disney franchise. The others are mostly franchises that have already had a big following and are well known, so they always do well. The most visible thing that I notice though is the drop of a full 1 billion dollars from 2019 to 2025.  \nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder what the reason as to why movies appear to not be such a popular thing to do anymore. Have there been less movies being produced or is the intended audience getting too old for these kinds of movies? I also can consider that people have starting to do more activities outside after the pandemic, since after 2019 it continues to decrease. The popularization of streaming movies can also be a factor to the decline. \n\nHow do your own summer moviegoing habits, and those of your friends and family, relate to this graph?\nThinking about it, I realize that this summer I did not see a movie once, and I usually do.

While revenue since quarantine has slowly declined, at least throughout 2023 - 2024 it seemed to at least keep some steady numbers, but this year it dropped from 2.1 billion to 1.6 billion. My guess is the reason as to why this has occurred could be due to how people wait for the movie they've been anticipating to come out on stream services. I know multiple people myself who do this, and it isn't that shocking considering how our world is still coming back from the whirlwind of COVID 2020. Even after quarantine, people were still comprehensive about going back to work, school, or just going to the grocery store, and there were still things put in place to prevent another large outbreak.

People were unable to leave their houses, so they had to substitute other activities with watching movies. I would also point out that the movies during COVID times are very feel-good movies, in contrast to movies like Oppenheimer and Twisters, which are more dark concepts, in relation to the demands of the time. \n\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nWhy is there such a steep drop from the summers of 2023/2024 to the summer of 2025? Both 2023 and 2024 represent a shift back into normalcy from the chaotic times of COVID, but this summer was not much different, so why the steep drop? \n\n\nHow do your own summer moviegoing habits, and those of your friends and family, relate to this graph?\nI have many younger siblings, so it makes sense that many of the movies on this graph in relation to my family are directed towards a younger audience. I have also found it common for younger people to rewatch the same movie numerous times. So while Lilo and Stitch may have a smaller audience, 2-12 years old, compared to the Barbie movie, 10-50 years old, due to the sheer amount of time these younger audiences watch the movies, it gains popularity. \n\n\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea.\n\nComing to Theaters this summer: Nothing, the Movie Industry is No More",

There looks to be five major movies per summer, with the amount of revenue slightly declining over the past six years. The movies that made the most amount of money during that summer are depicted as bigger and on the bottom of the graph, contrast to the ones that made the least amount, which are smaller and on the top of the graph. In 2025, the domestic revenue of the top 5 movies significantly declined with only $1.6 billion dollars made, opposing to the previous year which made $2.1 billion. \nWhat do you wonder?\nLess domestic revenue made reflects the fact that less people are watching the movies. I wonder why there is a gradual decline in watching movies over this six-year span. Does it have something to do with the movies themselves being worse and less appealing? Or does it have something to do with the people and that they simply just watch less movies than during previous years? \nHow do your own summer moviegoing habits, and those of your friends and family, relate to this graph?\nI recognize a lot more of the movies that are depicted in the beginning of the graph, and I remember seeing a lot of them in theaters.

A majority of these major hitting movies in 2023, 2024, 2025 consists of sequels (Toy Story 4, Inside Out 2) or live action remakes (Lilo and Stitch, the Little Mermaid) coming from Disney, insinuating a lack of creativity and instead a drive towards easy money-making opportunities. I'm not familiar with Top Gun, but the four other top performing movies (Lion King, Barbie, Inside Out, Lilo and Stitch) all seem to capitalize off the aspect of nostalgia in their audiences.\n\n2. I wonder why certain live action films perform better than others, such as comparing the Little Mermaid to Lilo and Stitch. In addition, Disney has been performing comparatively worse in revenue compared to previous years, so will the future lead to a new generation of novel studios and works?\n\n3. I think what is more interesting is the lack of circulation of these movies among my friends and family compared to years past. Before, there was so much hype and popularity surrounding the movies of 2019, 2022, and 2023. However, I couldn't tell you a thing about the 2025 movies, other than the fact that they're live-action remakes. Maybe me and my friends are just maturing to not like movies as much, but I think the revenue as well shows a general sway away from movies.\n\n4.

I too think more people are watching movies at home now. \nWhat important world event happened during 2020 and 2021 that kept people home from the theaters?

I noticed that in 2019 movies made a lot of money, but since COVID it has went back up.

Movies made between $1.6 billion and $2.6 billion, and the highest total was in 2019 with $2.6 billion. The 2025 numbers are preliminary, which means they might change.\n\n2. Why did the top summer movies make less in 2025 than in earlier years? Are there any causes? The ones I can think of would be fewer people going to the movies and fewer big hits. \n\n3. Summer movies usually make a lot of money, but the amount can go up or down. Superhero or animated movies appear in the top 5, which shows they are really popular. The drop in 2025 could mean that people's movie-watching habits are changing.\n\n4. This shows what kind of movies a lot of people in the U.S. like to watch during summer break or vacation. It makes me think about how entertainment trends can change and how movies are a big part of culture during the summer. Maybe it explains what movies people my age are talking about or excited to see.",

This might mean that companies are focusing more on the younger generation than trying to capture the attention of older generations.\nIn 2019, all of the shown movies are remakes and sequels. These sold the best in theaters, maybe suggesting that humans enjoy familiar franchises rather than new movies. To add to this, the movies lower in revenue are new movies and not remakes.\n\nWonder: Why do original movies sell better than remakes? \nWhy wouldn't people like new experiences and stories, and rather prefer the same story repeated?",
