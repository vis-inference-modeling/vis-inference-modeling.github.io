When writing this, the infrastructure plan was just passed, but was brought from 2.3 trillion dollars to 1.2 trillion dollars. So I would say this shows what the democrats wanted to first push and pass into congress. \n      When looking at the infrastructure plan, I wonder how 400 billion dollars to In-Home Care is part of infrastructure, and also Jobs and Innovation. I think those things are important, but those types of things aren't really part of infrastructure. \n       Both bills would help many things, and people across the country, but would raise taxes on many people as well. That's what I see when it comes from the graph. I added some information that the graph doesn't say, but I think it's important to talk about.",

Because it seems here that he is putting a lot of money into more categories for infrastructure, but not as much as for families.\n3) This could impact me and my community because people are paying taxes and we need to know how our taxes will be used.Also this will have an impact on us, because stuff is being renewed and that could make the country better.These money can also benefit students.\n4)  I think this plan can help Americans' families, because if colleges are free then families won\u2019t have to worry about can\u2019t afford college.

After looking over the graph our group noticed a few things. The first thing our group noticed was how the graph worked, each color indicated which plan it belonged to and the size of each side represented how much of the money they will receive. Next, we saw that overall, Biden is planning on giving more money to the infrastructure plan, rather than the family plan. Our next observation can act as an explanation for this as we noticed that the family plan has far less variety and that the infrastructure plan is far more detailed. Our group is left with some questions about this graph. The first is that our group would like to see a more detailed chart to show exactly where the money goes. We would also like to know more about the logic of each decision and why some areas are deemed less important than others.",

Also, each one of those plans is separated into segments proposing the budgets for different portions of each plan. In addition, we noticed each number on the graph is measured in billions of dollars. Lastly, we also noticed that the most money is either going towards Building and utility infrastructure and Tax Credits. We wonder how much money is already in place for each program?. Is there anything in specific that will be included in the In home care and tax credits budget?, and will the free universal preschool ever get expanded to college or beyond?. This will have a positive impact on us and our community, we\u2019d be able to use public goods more often and everyone would be able to benefit from better infrastructure. The innovations in Public transportation would also help our environment since less people would be using cars. \nSara, Bianca, Bri",

Also, we wondered why the infrastructure plan seems to have more of a focus than the families plan? Is this because education isn\u2019t getting as much money as others? Finally, we wondered how the amounts of money were decided in reality and how it will impact the country altogether? This impacts our community because where money is being put impacts everyone.

I wonder why more money is being given to infrastructure than family plans, and I also wonder why high-speed broadband is being given the same as public schools, while electric vehicle incentives are also being given almost as much as the two combined. The impact this will have on me personally is that federal taxes will likely increase, however the impact this will have on my community and the nation as a whole is public education not improving as less important things such as high-speed broadband do.

Additionally, some of the categories include many smaller sub-divisions (such as the jobs and innovation category), though others don't include anything other than the plan itself (such as In-Home Care). What was even more suprising, in my opinion, was how close in size each section was, which shows that this plan is virtually divided equally. However, sub-divisions inside each category are not as equally distributed, such as in education. This category impacts me the most, as I am still a student going through the education system. Funding for schools, and other education related purposes, are so important to balance out because the education system has been lacking some attention these past fews year, particularly in Arizona. I find it very interesting that the ratio between the funding for teaching and the plan for preschools is about 1:22. That's quite surprising considering that teachers are needed for education to happen, and preschool does not need as much to function as an organization (not everyone goes to preschool even when it's free, less trips/extracurriculars than a primary/secondary school and generally less neccessary supplies).

The infrastructure plan is much more split up, and has more categories.\n2. I am wondering what exactly the money going towards public schools is for. Is it for reconstructing facilities or is it for school supplies for students? Is it both? \n3. This plan could possibly affect life at school, if funding goes towards building new facilities for students then students may be exposed to new experiences.\n4.

However, this graph also shows that he acknowledges that the American families need help because of his families plan. Therefore, this graph allows people to see that President Biden cares equally about the issues presented in his plans because the graph is almost split in half money wise. When this money is set aside for families, quality of life will improve for most people because they will have better access to schooling. Crime may also decline because families will gain financial support and become less desperate to obtain money.

I definitely think that the teachers area should have gotten some of the preschool's money but then again the teachers do get $9 billion.",

Out of the money being directed towards the family plan, much of it is going towards tax credits, and not education. And on the infrastructure side, it is split pretty evenly between buildings and utilities, transportation, in-home care, and jobs and innovation.\nI wonder how effective this economic proposal will be. I wonder how it will affect different sectors of society, such as the education system, the economy, and the family sector. It seems like taxes will be increased in a lot of places, so I wonder how people will react to that. \nThis plan seems more focused on larger towns and cities as opposed to small towns like Reading, because it will be overall more effective if it focuses on those areas. I can see maybe the education portion of it affecting our town, but not much else past that. I like that a significant portion of the transportation is devoted to electric vehicle incentives, so hopefully we\u2019ll get to see more of that expanding into our smaller towns.\nThis is a graph about Biden\u2019s economic proposal and where he would delegate money to.

When looking closer, it became apparent that each side represents a different part of Biden's $4.1 trillion infrastructure and families plan; orange for infrastructure and green for families. Each main colored category is again divided, and those divisions are divided again into more specific sections and marked with prices. Interestingly, In-Home Care and I.R.S. are the only divisions within the colored split not divided again, and there is one for each side of the split. \n2. As seen below the graph, Biden plans to pay for the plan using increased tax from corporations and the wealthiest Americans. I wonder how these people are currently reacting to the idea proposed and (if it is activated) how they will react later. What problems might spring from their willingness or unwillingness to pay?\n3. Having less expensive community colleges could seriously benefit youth today. Particularly those in low-income families by making a higher level education available. Not yet exposed to the adult world, the effects the plan currently has on me are low. But later in life, the effects of this plan could impact my future. Certain parts of the infrastructure receiving more money will provide better job opportunities in those divisions. \n4.

In my opinion, everyone needs a teacher and it is vital to learn, but an airport is used far less in a person's life. On top of there is an \"other\" section that is making $25 on each person.

I think putting together a budget, especially one of this size, is extremely difficult so I wonder how each amount of money was divided up so that the needs of each section would be met. I also wonder how different age groups will react to this budgeting. I know people that are younger, millennials and gen z, have been pushing for a lot of this green energy and free education stuff. It makes me think how older generations might feel, possibly seeing this as another way younger people have it easy. \nI think a lot of this will affect everyone in the US. As someone currently in community college I know this would benefit a lot of my friends and peers who struggle financially. I also know that affordable housing is extremely important as the cost of living is on the rise.

    "comment info": "The first thing I notice as far as the infrastructure plan goes is that electrical grid and clean energy are grouped together. I would like to see a further breakdown of exactly where that 100 billion is going. Since clean energy is very vague it is important that it goes to sustainable clean energy. The second thing I notice is that electric vehicle inscentives receive a large portion of the transportation section of the plan. This is great and we should be moving towards electric vehicles but we have to focus on making this plan help all people. Public transport received a little less than 50% that of EV indcentives. 86% of Americans use a car to get to work, many of whom do not have the means to purchase a new car. It is crucial that these Americans are not left behind. Putting more funds into public transportation would greatly reduce carbon emissions as well as decrease traffic and increase efficiency in travel. One thing I would like to see in the infrastructure plan is money set aside for education about global climate change. Since green energy seems to be a focus of this package it only makes sense to inform the next generation about how it works. I see this as a crucial step in combating misinformation lobbied by the big oil companies as they continue to attempt to derail the progress of green energy. One thing about this plan that makes me very excited is the money set aside for research infrastructure as continuous innovation is crucial to save the planet",

I think it\u2019s important that the money is coming straight from citizens\u2019 taxes and technically, we are the ones that are funding this plan. \n\nI wonder if this is a direct reflection of what the Biden administration is prioritizing right now, infrastructure over families. I\u2019m not exactly sure how urgent the need for improved infrastructure is right now in the country, but I\u2019m sure that there will be questions about if this is the best use of the country\u2019s budget and if that\u2019s more important than the issue of local economies with the pandemic. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how much effect the Infrastructure Plan will have on small towns like ours. I think that it will be mainly focused on bigger commercial cities. So, I don\u2019t think the Infrastructure Plan will affect me, personally, that much. On the other hand, the Families Plan has a large percentage dedicated to education, and as a highschool student, that is bound to have visible impacts on the environments that I spend much of my time in. Whether that ends up making school cheaper overall, I don\u2019t know. \n\nThe graph is split up into two sections, the Infrastructure Plan and the Families Plan. Each of these sections are then further divided into smaller categories like Buildings and Utilities, Transportation, Child and Family Support, etc. \nTitle: \u201cGet in Loser, we\u2019re going Shopping\u201d",

People want to have better education material with less financial troubles, having the family plan will help people learn earlier and spend less money for education for the youth. However, more money is being spent on high technology for better, transportation, jobs, and fancier homes. All thought it is interesting to see the future plan of what the world would be like.

Funding for public schools will also be a big deal because even in reading there was talk of cutting arts, and language classes so hopefully those can stay.\nMy title is \"how our money is coming back to us\"",

I also noticed the biggest category is Tax Credits and the expansion of the child, earned income, and child and dependent care tax credits has 600 billion dollars set aside for it. There is also 174 billion reserved for electric vehicle incentives. \n\nI wonder why they need 45 billion dollars just to eliminate lead pipes. It shouldn't take that much money, but while they're doing that they should rid the drinking water of fluoride as well. It seems they are putting 66 billion into water systems so hopefully, it will be fixed. Also, I wonder why they need 200 billion dollars for free universal preschool compared to only 109 billion for only 2 years of free community college. \n\nOne impact on the community would be the 115 billion dollars going towards roads and bridges will increase road safety which has 20 billion in that category as well. The 31 billion dollars going toward small business will impact me and my family greatly due to our family business\n\nThe graph shows how they will budget the money. \"Biden's Big Plan\".",

Among the Infrastructure Plan, it looks like Transportation and Buildings and Utilities will be a large focus with In-Home care and Jobs and Innovation trailing closely behind. Within the Families Plan, Tax Credits looks to be the greater focus than the other areas included. \nI wonder what changes we will see happening in the country as these plans progress. For example, I am curious to see what changes are made in education regarding colleges and universities. \nIf these plans are put into place, both will affect my community greatly. The education portion of the plan will help to make college a more affordable and reachable option for students. Similarly, the free preschool would grant children access to education even if they cannot afford it. \nPresident Biden\u2019s $4.1 Trillion Plan Breakdown",
