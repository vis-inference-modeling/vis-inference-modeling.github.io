How does this relate to you and your community?\n      - I would say that this could relate to me by maybe confusing all the words starting with the same letter and ending with similar endings.

For example, people may think of a words such as fork, and whipping as both very simple words, but the quantity of letters makes them seem more complicated.\nHow does it relate to your community?: It relates to a high school audience due to its simplicity.

    "comment info": "Spelling Bee's using graphs \n\nI noticed that the easiest spelling words are terms that have four letters and have been used/known for a long time. I also caught how the words usually have an O used once or twice. The Hardest Spelling words have more lettering like 5-10 letters in each. I'm curious if students get the option to have a cheat sheet or study guide where they get to study. Something that also got me wondering is if the players who participated could speak other languages. Is English their first speech? Most English words have silent letters or different spelling than how it's said. I think that spelling is something everyone struggles with at one point. Like I said before some words have a weird spelling form than how it's spoken and can make it difficult to write. Once students grow up spelling becomes a job that is meant to be developing over time. Mostly in their school life, it can be hard if they see others succeeding and they're falling behind and feel ashamed to ask for help.",

I also noticed that the level of difficulty correlates with the number of letters within the word, It appears that words containing four letters were easier to guess than words with 6-8 letters.\n2. What do you wonder?\nI wonder how many participants there were in this particular survey and their backgrounds, specifically the languages they speak to try and figure out if there\u2019s a connection to the words that were accurately guessed. I\u2019m also curious to find out if there\u2019s a definite connection between the length of words and the percentage of guesses. \n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis graph shows that looking at society as a whole, we have not expanded our vocabulary beyond simple words used in daily conversation. I view the spelling bee game as a way for people to expand their knowledge and enlighten those around them with a deeper understanding of language and word use.\n4.

They both span over the time of a week. Between 16-39% guessed the hardest words. 98-99% guessed the easiest words. I notice that many of the easiest words end with a 'k' and have an 'o' or 'oo' in them. They also tend to have only one syllable. This makes sense, since shorter words are easier to think of. The harder words usually have more syllables and a surprising amount of them begin with the letter 't'. This could be because people didn't expect to see a 't' at the front of a word. Even I don't know some of the hard words, so it shows that I have something to learn.

It depicts how people struggle to look past a basic vocabulary when challenged. Some of the least common words are not overly obscure but are also not common words. When put on the spot many people struggle to look past their basics and experiment with words. It is natural to lean toward the easiest options at first, hence it is not a surprise that basic words are much more common than more complex vocabulary. I wonder how hard people try to find the more complicated words. I play the spelling bee sometimes and I am terrible at it because I also struggle to find the more complex words. I often mix random letters and miraculously come across difficult words. I wonder how many of these words were found that way as well.

The yellow bars on each graph indicate the percentage of words that each contestant was able to identify and correctly spell. \n\nA noticeable trend emerged when analyzing these graphs: shorter, more common words that are frequently encountered in daily life were associated with a significantly higher success, with an average of 98% participants correctly identifying four-letter common words. In contrast, a mere 16% of individuals managed to identify the longer, less common, and more difficult words.  \n\nThis intriguing pattern poses the question to consider whether age might be a factor in an individual\u2019s ability in this game and can even be generalized to the influence of age on an individual\u2019s ability to recognize varying difficulty of words.

I noticed that a great deal of players found that words used very commonly were the easiest to find and had the highest percentage of 99%.  It seems that the obviously easier words like book or fork were found much quicker them something like trigram or coulee. I wonder what audiences tend to get the more difficult words spelled correctly and think of them in general. Would it be players of an older age group or possibly people that have been playing it longer? It is a very interesting graph to represent the data from the game.

The bar graphs represent percentages of players who spelled each word correctly. Clearly, harder words had a lower percentage of players spelling them correctly while the easier words had a higher percentage of players spelling them correctly. I noticed that the easier spelling bee words are used more commonly in everyday life and I can conclude based on the percentages that that might contribute to why they're easier to spell. I also noticed that the majority of the easier spelling bee words are only four letters. In the description below, it notes that four-letter words are only worth one point while longer words earn one point per letter. None of the hardest spelling bee words are 4 letters. Therefore, they will be worth more points than 9/10 of the easier spelling bee worlds. I observe there is a correlation between the length of a word and how hard it is to spell. Longer words seem to be trickier in terms of spelling hence why they might be worth more points. I wonder about the average age of people who complete this spelling bee challenge from the New York Times. Are they older or younger?

Additionally, I noticed that with the 10 easiest words, the majority of them, with the exception of \u201cwhipping\u201d, were 4-letter words, whereas the 10 hardest words all had a minimum of 5 letters with the longest word having 10 letters. I wonder if there is a negative correlation between the word length and the percentage of players finding each word. Although this is the case for many of the words, there are a couple exceptions such as \u201cwhipping\u201d having a 99% finding rate and \u201cgrammarian\u201d having the highest finding rate out of the hardest words. This relates to my community because many people I know enjoy playing New York Times games dealing with vocabulary, but this demonstrates that our vocabulary is still very limited. My headline for this graph would be: \u201cNew York Times\u2019 Game Spelling Bee Reveals The Complexity of Our Vocabulary\u201d.",

The Spelling Bee, a daily challenge in which players recieve a series of seven letters and must find as many word combinations as possible, has become one of the most played NYT games. This graph shows the percentage of players that discover easier versus harder words during the daily challenges from September 23rd to the 29th. Between 98% to 99% of players spelled the top 10 easiest words. Nine out of these ten words contain four letters, with \"whipping\" being the exception. As for the top ten hardest words, the percentages range from 16%, the number 1 hardest word \u201ctrigram\u201d, to 39%, the tenth hardest word \u201cgrammarian\u201d. I wonder why certain words, such as \u201cclade\u201d, are harder for people to spell. While it is not necessarily a word one hears every day, it is not a complex word to write. My community, and surrounding regions in New Jersey, is known for an amazing education system both public and private. Throughout my schooling, many of my teachers have been keen on the usage of vocabulary. So, I wonder how well I, and the other students in my community, would perform on the Spelling-Bee. Would a high percentage of us be able to reach the hardest word? Within the classroom, games such as Spelling Bee could be a fun way for students to improve their spelling and vocab abilities. \n\n\nThis \"Spelling Bee\" Means Serious BEEs-ness!",

Interestingly, 98% of players identified the top ten spelling bee words from September 23-29. A surprisingly large number of players identified at least ten words, suggesting that many players were already decent at word identification. This would skew the data, as a skilled demographic would likely perform higher overall. The hardest words were multisyllabic and less common.\n\nI wonder if adults or students were better at the spelling bee. My guess is that adults with a communication or literature-based profession would perform better than students. However, if the adults only deal with numbers, then students may outperform them. I also wonder if people's average performance has decreased over time.\n\nThis relates to me because I enjoy doing spelling bees. However, my confidence has diminished because of the high percentage of players finding at least 10 words! This relates to my community because the low identification of more challenging vocabulary may indicate a decrease in people's lexicon. The data in the graph would have to be compared to previous spelling bees to determine a trend.\n\nThe graph depicts the hardest and easiest spelling bee words from September 23-29, demonstrating that multisyllabic, uncommon vocabulary words were less easily identified.\n\n\"When Spelling Bees Fizzle Out\"",

The directions of the game state the word has to be at least 4 words, so most of these easiest words are the minimum. I notice that the words that were included in the 10 hardest words, were words that are not commonly used or are used in everyday life. Personally, I have not even heard of most of the words on that side. I notice that the only easiest word that is not 4 words and one syllable, is \"whipping\". Whipping is the verb-form of another word on this list, \"whip\". I wonder why that is the only verb-form of these 4 letter words on the list, and why it was not as common to add the suffix \"-ing\", to other eligible words, such as book or hook. This graph displays two separate bar graphs. The left bar graph depicts the 10 hardest spelling bee words from the 23-29, while the graph to the right of it provides the ten easiest spelling bee words from the same time-span. Both were measured by the percentages of people who found the words. This relates to my community, as many people play this game. It is helpful for players of the game to be aware of different patterns within finding the easiest and hardest words, as it will increase their probability of finding difficult words. \n\"The key to bee-ting Spelling bee\"",

The Hardest words are longer but also add in the factor of silent letters and being pronounced differently than their spelling. Which can trick the listener by making it hard to sound the word out to spell. I wonder what the demographic of the group is. Specifically age and level of education, because to a professional speller the hard words may be easy but to someone who is younger this may be the first time they are seeing these words. This affects me and my community by showing that some higher vocabulary needs to be added to students' repertoires. By making the harder words more used it can change the list and expand people's vocabularies and education. Students and even adults should be constantly learning and expanding their vocabularies because it is good for them. \n\"Busy Bee's Spelling\"",

I noticed that there is a larger number of players that guessed the easier words.

I am curious about the average age of players that guessed the 10 hardest spelling bee words, in comparison to the average age of players that guessed the 10 easiest spelling bee words. Are the people that guessed words like \"trigram,\" \"tangram,\" and \"trimaran\" older, younger, or the same age as individuals that guessed the easier spelling bee words?

This is shown in the word trigram which has 7 letters 16% chance of being found and fork is 4 letters and has a 99% chance of being found.\n2.I wonder why the words for the spelling bee are chosen and if there are certain requirements the words have to meet. I also wonder if the length of the word correlates with how often people find it.\n3.This relates to me because I was once in a spelling bee and had much difficulty spelling the longer words that I was generally unfamiliar with. This graph showed that my struggle was quite common as the graph displayed the fact that complex and rare words generally tended to have lower rates of being found. \n4.Can you Bee-at the Odds and Spell These Words?",

I noticed that, in the graph of the 10 words that were the easiest to spell in the spelling bee, 98\u201399% of participants correctly spelled those words, indicating that the majority of participants were proficient spellers. In contrast, the highest percentage of participants who correctly spelled a word in the graph of the words that were the hardest was 39%. The majority of the simple words, or 90%, had four letters or fewer, whereas the hardest terms had between five and ten letters. \n2. I wonder why a relatively long and hard looking word like \"whipping\" is the easiest word that could be given in a spelling bee as I could think of a lot more words that would be easier. I'm also wondering about the age range of the contestants in this spelling bee as well as the quantity of sources used to arrive at these results.\n3. This relates to me and my community as we are constantly having to deal with our vocabulary and knowledge of spelling. Whether it's a 2nd grade spelling bee in the auditorium, or a 10 page paper due for your literature class at the local college, Spelling and literature will always have a big effect on us. \n4.

While the hardest words were long words and also words which some may have never heard before as their use is very rare.\n\n2. I wonder what age range is participating in the spelling bee as it makes a major difference since the younger the participants are could lead to them to not hearing a word before in their life since they don't have as much knowledge as maybe an adult or senior citizen.\n\n3. This related to my community as I think that if we were to have a spelling bee at school a lot of the students which participate in the event might have not heard some of these words used, let alone know their definitions or spelling.\n\n4.

It makes sense since not only would it be easier to guess a four letter word, but it also gets increasingly harder as you try to guess words with more characters and even more unique letters in them as well.\n2. I wonder why the least guessed words contain letters like T and R. Maybe it\u2019s due to the fact that those letters aren\u2019t commonly in the beginning or at the end of a word like the letter S, so guessers have a harder time narrowing down possible guesses.\n3. The reason this affects me and my community is because not only does it show that I might have to work on my vocabulary, but I should also try to always find all of the possible guesses in a game like this because there really are countless different words that I don\u2019t know but could easily learn from a game like this.

Now that I really look at it the easier words tend to be shorter than the harder words 9 out of 10 being four letters but even with that factor some of the harder words are five or six letters making the point I brought up earlier with unpopular vs popular words more believable. \n                I wonder why whipping is one of the easiest words. It's much longer than the other easiest words and yet it still ranks one of the highest.\n                  A good headline for this graph would be: \"Easy Or Hard: Spelling Bee Words\"",

But I'm sure we all know that already. Certain words like callaloo are harder for some people to spell because it is not as popular. I know what callaloo is so I know how to spell it, but people who don't know what it is have a harder time. At the same time even if a word is popular like technology, for example, you will go through trial and error until you get it right sometimes. This is based more on the knowledge of different people.

If you think about it, when's the last time you used the words \"hone\" or \"hoof\"? Despite their lack of everyday use, I think that a few patterns in their lettering combined with their simplicity lead to making them very easy to identify on Spelling Bee. It's easier to identify words that end with a letter pattern such as \"ck\" or \"ing\" because you can predict a word much easier that way. Another pattern that I noticed in this graph is that many of the words have two of the same letter right next to each other, like \"book\" and \"rook\". Lastly, the vast majority of the easiest words are four-lettered, so they don't take a lot of time to think about. \n        On the contrary, the 10 hardest spelling bee words are the complete opposite. There isn't a single word on that graph that I would use unless in a very specific conversation, and their complete lack of patterns makes it harder to identify. The smallest word on the list is five letters, which is also something different from the easiest word graph. \n\nI would title this graph: \"Spelling Bee Buddy is Busy\"",

I play the game every so often and typically rifle out a few simple words with minimal effort but as I get deeper in I try different combinations. I'm not thinking about what words fit I'm scrambling letters together. When the first ones you get are short and have a vowel in the middle every time and don't repeat letters its a lot easier than when they are repeating letters over and over again. I wonder if the words that have more vowels and repeating letters are more difficult for people.

At least in my opinion, I've never heard the word coulee, or the word Toccata. I think this makes a big difference, because knowing the word means that you've been exposed to it. The easier words were one, very well known, and two, they weren't especially long.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\n- The first thing I wondered was how many people actually participated in the spelling bee. I think it makes a big difference because maybe the group of people was very small, meaning that there was possible under coverage in the sample. At the same time, the people doing the spelling bee might be the type of people who regularly do puzzles such as this one. I wanted to know more about the type of people participating in this spelling bee, as well how many were part of the sample. \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\n- This relates to the community because some of these words are used regularly. The words in the \"easiest\" section, are words that we see every day. I used to participate in Spelling Bees at my old school. I think it's vitally important to understand the words you're trying to spell, especially if they have different pronunciations. \n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?\nThe graph shows the percentages of people who spelled the words correctly.\nWhat starts with T and is seven letters?
