The places with extreme condition have high water stress because they don\u2019t have enough resources to provide for themselves, also the coutnries with the most populated may have problems because they are trying to comply to many people. I predict that as population continues to grow there will continue to be a higher stress on water.",

I live in the north east and i found that water has a low stress level according to the map. I believe this is so because there are more trees in the north east which could play a factor of why water is so accessible. As to the west of the united states water is more scarce because there are not a lot of trees and the air is more dry.

Even the wealthier countries struggle with water security like the US and parts of Canada and Russia. This is because even though they have the money to afford a ton of water they still have a high population of people that need it. I wonder what \"Water stress level\" means. Is it, amount of water storage? The ability to supply water if the water they bring runs out? Or something different. My headline would be, The Struggle to Supply Water to Millions of People.",

Therefore, there is a lot of production happening causing pollution. I wonder why New York has an abundance of water due to the trend of heavily populated areas having high water stress levels. Some of the water levels may be due to climate such as California is a very dry desert area for the most part and New York is the opposite. It is hard to decipher a pattern in the graph due to the variation of the abundance of water in certain urban areas versus rural areas.

I wonder how imperialism and capitalism as it relates to the commodification of basic necessities has affected these issues. When I look here, the US, one of the most capitalist countries on the planet, as well as the proverbial Evil Empire has a surprisingly high level of water stress. Also, notice how red India is. I am positive that colonization has something to do with this. I also wonder how much of this is simply due to government incompetence, which has to be factored in. if i were to  make a catchy headline to describe what is going on in the graph, I would title it \"Let Them Drink Water\".",

In places such as California, particularly Los Angeles the water levels are extremely high. I wonder if this is due to an abundance of agriculture. In California, they grow almonds which need one-thousand nine hundred gallons of water to produce one pound of almonds. In the mid west the levels of water stress are medium to high levels of water stress because of Ogallala Aquifer losing water due to farmers using it at a higher level than the aquifer can replace. Unlike cities such as New York City, the abundance of snow and precipitation help to replenish wells and other sources of water. New York State has laws in place that protect the Finger Lakes which are the second largest source of freshwater in the world. By protecting the water supply, they are able to protect it from contamination and allow it to replenish. In India, the country seems to be in a constant level of high water stress. This is due to government corruption and lack of planning to filter out water from human waste. The graph is showing a combination of location, and financial situations and how they affect the water level stresses in major areas.",

There are several possibilities why these areas are suffering more than others. One reason may be overpopulation. Asia is the highest populated continent on the planet, which means greater competition for water resources among humans and wildlife. Another reason for water scarcity may be geographical location. Southwestern North America consists highly of desert terrain unlike the Northeast, which consists of grassland surrounded by large bodies of water.",

They both have great water way systems, and in Iceland the water is heated by geothermal power plants. Cities that have high water scarcity levels, are in some cases financially poorer.

Let me ask you \u2013 what is your evidence that \u201cthe highest populated areas were experiencing water droughts?\u201d  I wonder if there are low population areas that have water crises?  Can you find any?",

I wonder, however, why some areas are low on water supply, considering there are located near a large body of water, like California. It's also confusing why some areas that you'd think would be suffering are not. In this graph, we are presented with water stress levels throughout the entire world and how extreme the stress is.",

Would you please give us evidence that there is \u201ca trend correlating between the population and the amount of water present in these locations?\u201d  Are there examples where this isn\u2019t true?  \n\nRegarding your wonder about water scarcity for areas near large bodies of water, like oceans.

    "comment info": "My attention was drawn to Canada since that is where I live. I am very surprised to see extreme water stress in southern Manitoba and Saskatchewan. I wonder what factors are considered in determining water stress. Populations there are low and there are lots of fresh water lakes.  What is creating water stress? I wonder if the need for water for agriculture has had a significant impact. Does the water stress level change significantly over drought years and years with heavier annual rainfall? Are high phosphorus levels in fresh water lakes due to poor water treatment and agricultural run off considered in calculating water stress? In noticing the extremely high water stress levels around the globe I am lead to wonder: What water sources are available to areas with high water stress? What alternative water sources are being explored? A significant portion of areas with water stress are coastal. What progress is being made to make desalinating water more plausible on a large scale? What different stress factors are considered? I wonder if there are any obvious patterns linking urban areas with high populations and low stress levels? or with high stress levels? \"Water Woes\"",

I did a quick online search and found that the reason may be due, in part, to poor watershed management.  That could include many different factors.  Search online to learn more.  \n\nPlease return tomorrow to get the graph and map\u2019s Reveal at the bottom of the release.  There, we share the article that included these graphs plus much more.
