When I read the description, it describes that Houston got more than 50 inches of rain which tells us that in the graph a part of Texas would become light blue or blue. The reason for this was because to get 50 inches of rain after Hurricane Harvey, there has to be a series of long rains in order for it to reach up to that point.

From what I learned by looking through the material of this week's reading, graph's can be misleading through scale. There is a scale showing the amount of time in correlation to colors. The darker the color, the less the amount of time measured in years/months. Also, by looking at the bottom, it says that Hurricane Harvey brought Texas more rain, therefore the graph may be incorrect because the colors don't necessarily match up if that's what this graph is. I notice there is more lighter colors, which correlate with 3-5 years, closer to the Midwest which is usually dry. Almost the entire western side of America is yellow and lighter colors besides Washington, Oregon and some of California. The darkest colors are found in the southern, eastern part of the country, where Hurricane Katrina made landfall. I wonder what these colors are measuring. I know they are measuring the amount of time, but I wonder what the amount of time means. I feel like it would have to do with rainfall due to the caption at the bottom and the areas that are colored the same. I think what is going on in this graph is how far ago from this point did this area receive tremendous rainfall/rainfall causing flooding/recovery.",

I also noticed the key located above the map that described what each color on the graph represented. At first, I didn't understand the key but then I noticed the caption below the map. The caption said that by the time Hurricane Harvey left Texas, parts of Houston had been hit by more than fifty inches of rain. From that, I realized that the key shows that the colors are illustrating how long it took for other parts of the country to get as much rain as Houston did just during Hurricane Harvey. However, the caption doesn't exactly say that, so I wonder if that's actually what the map is showing. It's definitely possible that the map could be showing different data.",

I've never been to the west coast, and I don't really know what's going on there. I wonder if the west coast always have that much rain each year? Because from the graph, it seems like Texas have just the same amount of rain as some of the cities at the west coast.\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?\nI bet this graph is talking about the amount of rain Texas gained after the hurricane Harvey left. From here I can see that the damage of hurricane Harvey is pretty severe that the rain itself is more than 50 inches. With an amount like this, Texas must have faced a huge damage and the the reconstruction must be made immediately-- this will cost a lot of money, too.",

I figured the graph had to do with something environmental, since for the most part, the different regions of the US were different colors. The text referenced Houston, and there are also dark colors in that area and other Gulf cities. I think that the graph is depicting how long it takes each area of the country to have >50in of rainfall. This would make sense since the west is typically drier and the Seattle, WA and Oregon areas are rainy. Houston is also dark (the hurricane dumped 50 inches of rainfall there over the course of a week!) and SC is showing between 12 and 16 months, and our annual average is in the 30-40 inch range.",

I know this because below the graph there is a statement that says, \u201cBy the time Hurricane Harvey left Texas, parts of Houston had been inundated by more than 50 inches of rain.\u201d In addition to this, the color coding key at the top of the graph shows that the darkest blue is the shortest amount of time (four months) and the lightest green is the greatest amount of time (five years). This is where my conclusion about the amount of rain and amount of time it took to get that much came from. Another thing I noticed that led me to this conclusion is that the coloring of the map corresponds to my inference about the diagram. For example, the Pacific Northwest and where Hurricane Harvey hit is colored dark blue. According to my idea, this means that it only takes four months for the area to get 50 inches of rain. This makes sense because the Pacific Northwest coast is on the windward side of the Rockies, giving it extensive rainfall, and the Houston area has gotten a lot of rain recently from the hurricane. You can also draw conclusions from the areas that are light green. The central United States is mostly green, which also makes sense because states like New Mexico and Arizona barely get any rain, so it would naturally take around five years...",

I believe this because at the key at the top it says darker blue is less time and lighter blue is more time. This would support my theory of time. It is also very similar to maps of rain related to being dry. You might think this could be how much time it will take to get to 50 inches but that would mean New York  would go to 50 inches in 12 months while a big part of texas will get to 50 inches in 5 years.

By seeing this, and contrasting it to other areas of the country on the graph, it is safe to say the graph has something to do with water. There are different shades of blue, some dark, others very light, and sometimes not present at all (like in the southwest). The colors are connected to the key on the type, that is labeled with months. The less months, the darker the blue.\n\nI wonder what the strip of blue is that goes down the eastern side of California. It stands out from the pale surroundings\n\nI think the graph is a measure of the amount of rainfall received received this year, and how it compares to the average amount of rainfall for each area.",

By the fact that the bottom text says that by the time Hurricane Harvey left Texas, parts of Houston had been inundated by more than 50 inches of rain, I believe this graph shows how long it would take to accumulate 50 inches of rain across the US.

I believe this because the areas that are color coded with the 8 year color are typically extremely dry and are almost impossible to flood. Every one of the blue areas are areas that are very susceptible to flooding. Now, you could argue that this is not the case, because typically California is known to have a very dry climate, but I believe that because it is more of the northern west coast that there could possibly be more precipitation there than perhaps the more southern west coast.",

The areas that would be deserts are the lighter (which indicate 5 years). The areas that are usually wetter are more blue/dark blue. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nWhen this map was created. What the colors mean. \n\nWhat's going on in this graph?\nOur thought is this is a time map. It is showing us how long is takes for each part of the United States to reach 50in of rainfall throughout a period of time. We hypothesize that the bar legend at the top indicates how long each area takes to get this 50in. For example, the darkest blue are the areas take 4 month (or less) while those yellow/green areas take up to 5 years or more to reach the 50 inches of rainfall that was created by hurricane Harvey in Texas.",

And part of Texas is covered in blue because there was a hurricane there. This is sort of confusing though because you would think that Texas and Florida would be more dark blue.

Whether or not the rainfall is heaviest off of the Pacific, Atlantic, or the Gulf of Mexico, it is clear that they experience the majority of the rainfall over a 5 year period. In contrast, the lightest almost whitest areas on the map represent the driest desert like terrain in the U.S. which yields very little rain compared to the rest of the country. What we can conclude from this map is that the areas shaded the darkest blue to the lighter blue recieve the most rain. The shades in between recieve the medium amount of rain and the light to the lightest shade of white are the areas of the U.S. that over a 5 year period receive the lowest measurable rainfall. In conclusion, it is clear, that the strongest, greenest vegetation lives where the rainfall is heaviest, while there is very little plant life where there is no rain.",

There is a lot of dark blue near the North West Coast, there's a lot of greens and yellows between the northwest coast and the central part of the United States, and a lot of light blues in deep blues near the east coast of the United States. I wonder why there is such a dark blue near the north west coast but not anywhere else. I also wonder why the scale is going from months to years. What I think is going on in this graph is that it's talking about how the hurricane has affected the amount of rain in a certain area has gotten and comparing it to rain they've gotten in the past.  The areas with light and darker colors means that they haven't had rain like they've had from the hurricane in whatever shade is according to on the scale. The lighter the color of the longer it's been the darker the color it's been more recent.",

We also noticed that the West is a yellow and that there is barely any blue in the Southwest. The Eastern part of the country is all blue shades. We wonder what the abrupt shift in color that splits the U.S. in half means. Why are there small blue areas in the West? What do the time intervals mean? What is in Northern California that would cause a blue line to separate from the coast? Does elevation affect the delineation between the East and West colors? We believe the different colors signify how long it has been since the area has last been flooded, with the darker blues being the most recent.

Thanks for joining the discussion today.\n\nLots of strong critical thinking about what story this graph is telling.  Many of you thought that it showed something about 50\" of precipitation for areas around the country.   You wrote about water levels, hurricanes, and amount of damage.  \n\nNow, that you have had time to think about the graph, is there more that you wonder?   The rain falls in particular regions, but how does it effect the people there and the land?  Does this vary form area to area?    Wondering will lead you to more deeply understand what this graph implies. \n\nKeep noticing  and wondering.  Come up with conjectures based on this graph.  Probe whether they are possibly true, and if not, change your conjecture.  You may continue to comment on other people\u2019s posts.  \n\nRemember to check back on Friday to learn more about this graph -- and we hope to see you again next month on Tuesday, October 10 for our next \"What's Going On In This Graph?\" \n\nSigning off now -- Sharon in Boston, where Hurricane Jose is now dumping rain in the Northeast, and Corey in Qatar, where is hasn't rained since I arrived here.",

Recently there were hurricanes in parts of Florida and Texas and those places are very dark blue meaning the water level is very high. In the western side of the United States, it is very light meaning the water level is very low because it is very dry. So that explains of the graph shows the water levels of the United States.",

    "comment info": "In this New York Times graph, a map of North America is shown to display the amount of time it would take for the area to reach 50 inches of rain. At the top of the graph there is a key which exhibits 4 months to 5 years, from blue to yellow, so you can tell the graphs data is based on the time of something. Near the northwest coast and the southeast coasts the land is a deep blue. The general western side of the United States is shown in light colors, signifying it takes a longer amount of time to reach something. In the eastern part of the United States, the general area is blue, and it ranges in the blue color in specific places. There is a caption on the bottom of the picture that gives information about Texas after Hurricane Harvey, and how it had been inundated by more than 50 inches of rain before it left. I feel that the graph is being used as a comparison to the caption to show how much damage Hurricane Harvey caused to Texas. The key would go along with this idea, as it is used to represent time. You could say that this graph is being used to represent the amount of rainfall in the United States, but at the top of the graph it shows that this is being used to represent the amount of time it takes to do something, not anything else. For these reasons, this is a map of the United States, comparing the normal amount of time it would take to reach 50 inches of rain, compared to Texas after Hurricane Harvey.",

In the lightest tan/yellow, it takes 5 years for 50 inches of rain to fall. This graph is probably shown during when the hurricanes hit Texas. In the the east side of Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana there is a lot of dark blue because that's where the most rain was falling. Since the hurricane didn't last four months, they had to average the rainfall for four months. In the west side of the United States, it takes a lot longer for 50 inches of rain to fall because they didn't have a hurricane hit them. Weather moves east, so the east side of the country is getting the extra rain from the hurricane. For these reasons, this is a graph that shows how much time it takes for 50 inches of rain to fall in a particular area.",

In the Midwest, it is a very light yellow-green which means it has not had flooding in four years. Towards the Southeast, it is dark blue which means there is lots of rain. This makes sense because there has been a major hurricane, Hurricane Irma. At the bottom of the graph, it states a fact about the 50 meters of rain after Hurricane Harvey. This relates to the water levels this graph shows. This could be graphing hurricanes, but there have not been hurricanes in many of the blue places. For example, in Ohio, we have not had a hurricane within the past 20 months. There are also many inland places that are in dark blue. If this were a hurricane chart, it would be extremely hard to have the inland areas affected, but not any coasts near it.

Therefore, cities that appear to have higher crime rates really just have lower rainfall.

So there are different colors representing how much water there was in each part on the graph.

Has it not rained in the midwest in years? Why is the key in years and not inches of rain? Etc!\n\nWhat's going on in this graph?: Due to the caption of the graph, and the legend given (in time), we believe that what is shown in the graph is how much time it takes each area to accumulate 50 in of rain. Thanks to HGHS Life School and others for their comments to get us thinking!!",

You can tell that the blue means more rain because of the past two hurricanes in Texas and Florida. It makes sense those states would get a lot of rainfall. The western area of the U.S. doesn\u2019t get as much rain because it is dryer. Also the two hurricanes were not going to hit the area. In conclusion based on the graphs and the wording it is talking about the amount of rainfall in the U.S.",

    "comment info": "When looking at the graph we notice that there is a range of colors spanning from dark blue to light yellow.  The darker colors indicate a shorter amount of time (up to 4 months) while the lighter colors indicate longer amounts of time (over 5 years). We also noticed that the darker areas of the map are the states that are known to have a lot more rainfall. We hypothesize that this graph shows the amount of time it takes each area in the continental United States to accumulate 50 inches of rain, on average.  For example, New York has a dark shade of blue covering the state, so we believe that means it would take 4 to 12 months to accumulate 50 inches of rain in that area. The driest areas of the country like Arizona are shown in light yellow, which would mean that it might take over 5 years for that area to accumulate 50 inches of rain, on average.",

The legend supports this because the darkest blue says 4 mo. which stands for 4 months and the ost yellow color says 5 yr. or 5 years. I know that this has to do with rain because the places closest to water( lakes, oceans, e.t.c) are the darkest. I know this does not depict hurricane Harvey\u2019s or Irma\u2019s path otherwise the California coast wouldn\u2019t be so dark because the Hurricanes aren\u2019t hitting their. I know this depicts rainfall because the most land locked places are the yellowest. Utah has a burst of green/blue where the salt lake city is(the huge lake is their!).

This is true because it is very dark near all coast lines and in the North-East and South and very light in the West where rain is less frequent. This could also be a graph showing the amount of rain a place gets in a certain amount of time, but the graph is set up so that it shows increasing amounts of time so each place is set up with a different amount of time which makes it illogical to try and determine the amount of rain.
