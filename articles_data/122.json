This affects me because it therefore means where I live is going to be more populated. More specifically, I live in Northern Virginia where it has more land development. This is important for where I live, because it means more people will be able to live there, which means more job opportunities.

I wonder why this is significant to us and to the world. Why is this specific data being recorded- and what is it going to be used for.\n I think the impact this has on me and my community is that land development may be happening in my area and can affect the people and businesses that are there already and if the land is being changed, it would most likely change the way people live and how buildings get made on the land.\nThis graph shows the areas in which land development is heavy and where land development is light. It seems to me that land development is not so strong on the east coast. The red dots are seen more on places like New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. However, the red dots are also seen a lot in Texas, which means Texas has a lot of land development happening in different areas of Texas.\nA catchy headline for this graph would be \u201cAmerica\u2019s Land Development\u201d because it fits the situation perfectly.",

In addition, we noticed that the population of a city does not really coincide with the new development in certain areas in the United States.

Another thing we wondered was what kind of land development they are referring to, public business areas or more private residential areas. We also wondered why Texas had so many concentrated areas of red dots. This impacts our community positively because the more developed a location has, the more opportunities for people and the more people come there to visit which grows that location a lot.

Although Connecticut is small it does look like it has the most development. Texas development is very condensed in some areas but in the rest very condensed.

While the urban areas in cities remain the same, developments are created in suburban areas surrounding the cities. A lot of new developments have occurred in some of the most populated states, such as Texas, California, and Florida. We also noticed that many of the new developments are concentrated in one specific area rather than being spread throughout a state. In Minnesota, the development was centered around the Twin Cities - we wonder if most of the development in other states are around major cities as well? Additionally, what is going around in the western area of North Dakota and why is so much development taking place there? We also found that there was not a lot of recent development in Maine? Are property taxes too high? What would cause private or public contractors to build elsewhere? Based on these new developments, this impacts both us and our community as new development is important for creating opportunities and providing for an expanding population. As development continues across the country, it is important that investments are made in states where new infrastructure is direly needed.

Our group wonders about the effectiveness of this graph and others like it. The areas of density on these types of maps are all generally quite similar to a population map. Comparing this map to a population map you can pinpoint all the big cities and densely populated places in the same areas where new development is occurring.

There is a large area of the east coast that has a lot of new land development. We also notice that the land development areas tend to be really condensed in one area. One state with lots of land development is Texas.\nWe wonder why the east seems to have more new land development vs the west and why are some of the newer land developments even necessary\u2026? Also, we wonder if maybe there might be a relation between the number of people who develop new land and the population of people in the United States? The impact that we are seeing is that many suburbs are being developed right now. There are a lot of rings on this map, and that shows that inner city land is not being developed right now. Instead, there is a ton of work being done in the suburbs. Expanding metropolitan areas are very common right now as shown in this graph.",

We also wonder why Texas has so much more land development than the other states. This impacts our community by improving our already existing land structures and by developing new areas of land to be used by the citizens of the United States. New land development could also mean repairs which are always important because it can be saving some landmarks that are somewhat older.

Could it be because these areas are creating more housing/residential areas due to the pandemic, trying to house people as much as they can.

And, the Census is used to determine the number of members of the House of Representative by state.  How could this development change political representation?

    "comment info": "I notice that the new land development has occurred near the eastern and southern parts of the United States. The red specks represent areas of land that has been developed or owned by the public like houses, commercial properties, industrial buildings, and recreational offices, or public buildings. This data is being shown through a computer model what areas of land they are using satellite imagery. I wonder is there a correlation between the population of people in the United States and the number of people who develop new land. I question does the amount of people affect the amount of land being inhabited. This graph impacts my community because it shows me the amount of land that my country owns and how much my country has expanded.  The map is giving me a view of how much new land that the United States has established and the new lands that are currently being developed. If I had to write a catchy headline it would be the \"Land Expansion of the United State.\"",

The blotches of red are areas where land was developed for homes, commercial centers, large buildings, and other facilities. I also notice that there is less land development in the west while there is more in the east. I wonder as to why is it that we see more land development in the east and not the west. This is because the west is notorious for having so much space and less developed land, so I would like to know why there is more development in the east if this area is already pretty condensed and immensely developed. This impacts my community in the sense that I live in the Northeast, and I worry that there will be too much development in my area. With land development comes more people, so it makes me a little anxious that my community may become very overpopulated. I know that in California, specifically L.A, there already is a lot of people there and the air quality is not  so healthy. Hopefully the same does not happen here.

However, it could destroy some of the important landmarks like forests or structures from the past.

When the map is compared to a map of population density, a high density  corelates in a high chance of deployment in that area. \n\n2. I wonder what the cost of each deployment is an if the graph could be coloured to show areas that have received more funding. \nI also wonder why there seems to be a lot of development in western North Dakota, as the population density seems to be awfully small. \n\n3. No apparent immediate effect as I live in Britain, but as a Cleveland Browns, and with plans to travel there after the pandemic, the investment indicates the area is on the up. \n\n4.
