Most people aged 18-29 supported all of the issues, but people aged 65+ mostly disagreed with them. I wonder if these are just issues that older people would tend to disagree with, or if this is an accurate representation of what most issues' support looks like? I believe that these graphs are showing what it looks like for certain issues that are disputed amongst different age groups, and showing which age groups are more likely to disagree with certain issues or not.\nHeadline: Disputes between ages: Who will come out on top?",

From what I observed the free college for all student's support rate is fairly from the younger age people around 18-29 due to the fact these are typically the ages people are in school. Another thing I observed is how Automatic voter registration is mainly for people who just started driving and young adults, I can concur that when you present people the ages 18-29 a way to register they will register. The greenhouse effect has a different sided average argument with the 18-29-year-old people agree with greenhouse fees people above the age of 65 do not which is probably because old people already have to pay taxes and a good amount of fees. From the last graph, I can infer that the 85+ crowd is below average in terms of the issues. A catchy headline for the graphs would be age effects average. \nWhy is free college low for adults?

People aged 18-29 typically have a great deal of support on issues that benefit them and people their age. An example of this is the approximate 70% approval rating for free college for all students. On the other end of the spectrum, those aged 65+ seem less in favor of these benefits. However, I also have to notice how in the survey of how many people feel the system they live in is stacked against them that those aged 65+ do not feel as though they are targeted as much as those aged 18-29 feel. This makes me wonder if the opinions of those aged 65+ are affected by their world view and if we should work together in order for those who are in power to not forget the little guy- those who feel the system is against them.

I notice that nearly 90% of 18-29 year olds support automatic voter registration, while the age categories of 50-64 and 65+ have a significant amount of less support for the topic. I wonder what their arguments would be for why not to support automatic voter registration. Free college for all students has a smaller average for support than the support of automatic voter registration. The 78% average support for greenhouse gas fees shows that this question was the least controversial one.

The topics present are ones that pertain more to them like automatic voter registration because most of the people voting are probably already registered. In addition, when one gets their driver's license, most of these people register to vote at the DMV.  Free College for All Students also applies to more of the younger generations because the average age of a college student is between the ages of 18-24. Lastly, the younger generations are most likely to vote because they are worried about issues that will affect them, like greenhouse gases and free college. Eventually, these younger generations will probably be paying for colleges for their children.\n\nI wonder why fewer older generations are voting since they were brought up in times that have greatly affected them, and they are very set on their ways and values.

That's not saying that older people don't go to college, in fact over 20% of the student body attending a 4 or more year college is over the age of 25.

    "comment info": "5th graders at Stedman Elementary studied these graphs in class and made lists of what we noticed and wondered. \n\nWe noticed: \n- Young people are more likely to want change.\n- Older voters are less likely to want things to change.\n- The older voters don\u2019t seem to care as much about the things that mostly affect the younger voters. \n-Many younger people want college to be free.\n-Over half of all age groups want greenhouse gas taxes; Greenhouse gas fees had the most agreement among the age groups.\n-18-29 year olds disagree the most with 50+ year olds\n-Most people supported most of these ideas, but a greater percentage of young people supported them than older people.\n\nWonder: \n-How would the graph change if we also separated out answers by race or gender? (Students especially wondered about the last question).\n-Who did the researchers ask these questions? Was it a diverse group of people?\n- How did they find the average of each issue?\n-Do the older voters think younger voters will make bad decisions and not want automatic voter registration? \n- We wonder if the graph will change in the future (when the younger people are the older people), or if it will stay the same because people\u2019s opinions change as they get older.",

Is because there are fewer senior voters or they have their different world experiences. \n\nI also wonder why younger people age from 18 to 29 would support free college for all students. I am sure there are fewer people from this group who would have income more than 200,000. Of course, it would be nice if young people could get a free college education. \n\nheadline\uff1a American political view by age groups.",
