I also notice that the lower-income countries are more likely to eat fast food, because the fast food is cheaper. However, if the country is too poor, they won't eat much fast food because fast food restaurants would rather put their restaurants in higher-income countries, where citizens there can afford to purchase their food. I wonder what they constituted as fast food. Would \"healthy\" fast food restaurants, like Chipotle, are recognized as fast food. I also wonder how they counted each of the fast food restaurants, and how many people eat there.",

I wonder if the correlation between fast food and wealth increasing has to do with fast food being cheaper than healthy food. I also wonder if the increase in fast food led to an increase in obesity and health problems(diabetes, heart failure.

Most of these highlighted lower middle income countries also had greater increase in wealth although % of change in wealth in either direction does not seem to impact the change of fast food sales. I wonder if the baseline GDP & its larger delta has any correlation with the change of fast food sales.  What might be happening is that as lower middle income countries increase in wealth, people can afford to eat out more, more people having jobs and have less time to cook. Meal preparation are essentially more outsourced to food preparation industry.",

    "comment info": "The graph shows a correlation between middle income and increased fast food sales, which implies there is higher consumption of unhealthy food by the middle class. For example, Vietnam, a lower middle income country has the second highest amount of fast food sales. This could be explained because average middle class people cannot afford to frequently buy organic, non-GMO, unprocessed food.",

Do you see evidence in the graph or is your thinking based on what you know about fast food and the poor?  Please explain.  Then, tomorrow afternoon, go back to the graph and see the Reveal at the bottom of the entry.   The Reveal gives you the link to the New York Times article and more.

    "comment info": "Here are our thoughts:\n1) There appears to be a correlation between increasing fast food sales and increasing wealth, meaning more money was related to more food sales.   However, we thought there would be more blue dots (high income) in the lower corner, because we thought people with higher incomes would be buying more expensive dining options.  \n\n2) We additionally thought that countries that are wealthier might also be developing more which would lead to more fast food restaurants.  In countries where there were already many fast food restaurants, there wouldn't be as a dramatic increase in fast food sales. For example, the United States would fall in this category.  For a country like China, they probabably had a much larger increase in reataurants as certain places become more Westernized.",

    "comment info": "Could Fast Food Chains be targeting low income countries? What I noticed was that the Lower middle and Upper middle income countries are higher in fast food sales and the High Income countries are decreasing and are a bit more scattered/clustered in one area of the graph. Thinking to myself I wonder if the reasoning behind the increase of fast food sales for lower and upper middle income countries is that the chain of fast food restaurants are targeting those countries to gain more profit and attract those who have less in their pockets only being able to afford fast foods. I believe what is happening in this graph is the clear sign that Fast food chains are more common and grown in sales for lower income areas and countries because fast food is more affordable, and can be accessed better than a healthy market. Fast food can be cheap to buy, and easy to attain. Because of this simple process and the amount of fast food chains in their areas it is an easier and effective way for low income people to have food for themselves or family's. As for the countries increasing in wealth it could also be due to those countries bringing in those restaurants for people to attain food. Fast food is becoming an epidemic around the world not just the U.S, we should all be seeing its effects and take action.",

You comment on that maybe the low cost of fast food makes it attractive to people in lower- income countries.  What else may attract these new customers to fast food restaurants?  Also, one of your comments is \u201cFast food is becoming an epidemic around the world.\u201d  What do you mean by \u201cepidemic\u201d?  Maybe it could be taken both literally and figuratively.

    "comment info": "Wow! There was so much to notice and wonder with this graph! Once we understood what the scale and the colour-coding was telling us, we started to ask questions about individual countries which would really require more research to answer. For example we first noticed that Greece had decreased in fast food sales by about 25% even though they had high income status. Why the decrease? This prompted another student to ask about Morocco as it is low/middle income but with stable wealth and an average increase (25%) in Fast Food Sales. Once this student commented, we had an \"ah ha\" moment as we realized that the horizontal axis had a lot of information to offer us. We went back to Greece which we then realized had significantly  decreasing wealth. We wondered why this is and thought that this would require more understanding of the economic and political situation in the individual countries.  Students cued into Argentina which had an astounding 120% plus increase in Fast Food Sales. They wondered if the explosion  had to do with soccer or tourism or some other major political/economic change. We then zoned in on  the United States. We asked why the US had only average increase in Fast Food sales and average increase in wealth. We then realized that the reference point was 2010-2015 which meant that the US already had an amazing amount of Fast Food sales at that point already. One of our students felt that a catchy title might be \"US Falling Behind in Fast Food Sales Growth\"",
