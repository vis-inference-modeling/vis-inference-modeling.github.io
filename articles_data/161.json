Slowly, over time, we started to come together and the population spread out, with different races living in difference neighborhoods, and eventually got to the 2017 graph, where the mostly white neighborhoods still hold the majority of the white population, but it is a lot more diverse than what it was 30 years ago.",

By 1980, the prevalence of predominantly white neighborhoods reduced by over half. In 2017, this trend of even race distribution continued until the frequency of white neighborhoods reduced by another quarter in respect to the 1980 census. Throughout these 37 years, the prevalence of predominantly black neighborhoods remained relatively constant. \n\nI wonder what caused this growth of racial diversity in American neighborhoods. I feel that this pattern could be linked to increasing economic and educational opportunities throughout our country. Due to the Obama administration\u2019s 380 million dollar investment in education and infrastructure in 2014, many people gained access to education through a system independent from skin color. Because of this increased connectivity in education systems, many culturally diverse people developed experience in different fields. \n\nGrowth in connectivity and infrastructure broke the chains linking race to social class and contributed to the growth of diversity in American neighborhoods nationwide.",

This shows the intense discrimination that persisted then. However, in the 2000 graph, it can be seen that the number of completely white neighborhoods dropped, and that the number of neighborhoods with about 50% nonwhite residents rose considerably. This trend persisted in the 2017 graph, where the same things happened as happened between 1980 and 2000. What this means is that whites and nonwhites are living in the same neighborhoods more than in 1980, as shown in the graphs. In fact, this is a trend I have noticed in my own neighborhood. \n    I was about four years old when my family first moved into my neighborhood. This neighborhood was small and quaint, and also probably about 90% white when we first moved in. This lack of diversity was very noticeable, and I only remember seeing a couple of nonwhite residents around me. However, over time, I began to notice change. Many new nonwhite families moved in. Now, there is probably about a 65-70% percent white population, which is still not the most diverse, but it is a much bigger step towards progress from 90% ten years before. Seeing this in my local community, I wonder if others have noticed this around them. Personally, I hope they have because this positive increase in diversity will lead to more respect between races and a better world.",

However, what specifically are you referring to when you say \"mass hysteria\" from white communities? Is there any specific even you were thinking of? Also, you say that the percentage of neighborhoods of entirely either whites or nonwhites dropped. This leads to greater diversity elsewhere and greater understanding of differing cultures, which benefits the world, creating a \"racial mix\" as you said. \n     Also, you mention slavery and Jim Crow Laws.

In 2017, white people made up of around 4% of all census tracts. I wonder what ethnicity or race makes up of neighborhoods today? How long did the research take? Were white people more comfortable to be living with other races back then? Did income have a part of this as well? I would name this graph \"Neighborhood Inequality\" because it shows how diverse neighborhoods are now than in 1980.",

Looking at the three graphs, we can notice that over time, more census tracts are in the center of the distribution. This increased diversity in American neighborhoods, however, is not attributed to dwindling non-white, segregated neighborhoods. Rather, most neighborhoods that have become more diverse have shifted from the right side to the center, with non-whites moving into previously white-dominated neighborhoods. \n\nThis change is extremely important in understanding shifting demographics and economic opportunities for difference races. A topic discussed in a recent NPR podcast is the importance of housing segregation \u2013 or a lack thereof \u2013 in economic mobility. During the middle of the 20th century, the government segregated housing, resulting in lost economic mobility for non-whites and an inability to hold appreciable assets. That is why as the descendents of the white households used their assets to send their children to college, non-whites suffered. Today, African-American income is about 60% of average white incomes, but African-American wealth is about 5% of white wealth. \n\nAs such, understanding racial diversity in American neighborhoods is extremely important, and the increasing diversity is a positive indicator for future wealth equality.",

In America, it does not matter if you are white, black, hispanic, or any other ethnicity to make something of yourself. This being said as more opportunity arises the more diverse American culture will become.",
