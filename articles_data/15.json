The classifications are also evident, with technomass and biomass being separated. Nonetheless, viruses also are kept nearly isolated, with it not being considered a living organism but not being a man-made entity. What I wonder is that, unlike humans, the virus is kept closer to the biomass side of the spectrum for a reason that I cannot understand. It is neither man made nor technology, so it should reside in between the two classifications. Regardless, humanity is apparently put in the middle even though they are living organisms, and viruses are visualized in the domain of life. On the contrary, the graph can illustrate a perceivable contrast between humanity and their creations, disclosing that the human community is outnumbered by their resources, and showing the advanced state of human technology. Currently, humans are swamped by substantial issues such as climate change and warfare, which can easily be explained by the amount of resources available for humans to commence such harrowing actions. \n    \n    Catchy Headline: \n    Biomass outnumbered by Technomass, a New Revolution\n    \n    - Euntak Oh, TMS",

    "comment info": "Headline:\n    Biology and Technology: How Two Forms of Mass Make Up Our World\n    \n    The graph depicts the mass of biological (living) forms and the mass of technological (man-made) forms on Earth. Each form is represented by a box, indicating its mass. The first thing I noticed when looking at this graph is that plants make up the largest mass in the biological forms. However, the technological mass in all still seems to outweigh the biological forms 1.3 trillion to 1.1 trillion. I also noticed how small the boxes of viruses and humans are compared to the other boxes. One thing I wonder about is when the technological forms started to outweigh the biological forms. Also, how would this graph look in the future, about 100 years from now? This relates to me and my community because it worries me about how the man-made forms outweigh the biological forms. As someone who lives on earth along with everyone else, I believe we should start practicing more sustainability and using less plastic and man-made materials. I also live in a more suburban area, across from the city and next to nature. This means I experience both the technological forms and biological forms.",

I also noticed that humans are very small in numbers compared to all the other categories in the graph. For the most part, metals and concrete are more dense then living substances. \n    I wonder how this information bout the mass of living things was obtained. There are many different types of plants that vary in mass. How did they get an estimate? Were all types of plants calculated? I also wonder if in the future, man-made objects will surpass living things in quantity, not just mass. \n    This relates to me and my community because I live in the Suburbs, where nature is prevalent.

I saw that the human box is just about as big as the virus box, which I think is incredible when you think how many people there are in the world, and then when you compare it to the amount of mass in the world, biological and man made, it is even more intruging to think about. In this graph I wonder why the graph doesn\u2019t have an image for the animals box. When I watched the animation of it, it was because the animals had so many sub categories, but then I wonder why this wasn\u2019t done for plants. The amount of biomass to man made mass is pretty equal when looking at the numbers, but I wonder why when I look at this graph man made mass looks like a lot more. This realtes to my community because every community creates waste and it is important to see how much waste is being created in the world, so that we can take steps to work towards less waste.",

    "comment info": "This graph shows the amount of mass on Earth from two different categories: biomass and technomass. Firstly, I noticed how man-made mass outnumbers biological mass on the Earth. I also noticed that the biggest group for biomass is plants and the rest of the biomass categories are much smaller. Technomass does not have one category that is much larger than another; the categories are all relatively the same amount. I also noticed how humans are the smallest block, yet cause the most amount of mass despite their physical smallness. I wonder if there would be a beneficial impact on the world if biomass outweighed technomass and what the effects of that would be. This relates to my community and myself because it is scary to see how plastics, concrete, and bricks outweigh many of the natural things that come from our planet.

The most interesting thing, is that plants have a way higher population than the animals in this world. The title and captions do not exist. The variables are mainly the biomass and technomass that composes of the Earth, and the variable that is being measured, is its proportional weight/population. I wonder if these boxes are actually sized proportionally to each other based on each population.

The majority of the earth's technomass is concrete. Humans are nothing compared to both the huge majorities of biomass and technomass, we are such a small amount compared to even the lowest bit of biomass and technomass shown on the graph. \n    2. I wonder why the number of humans on Earth can't even come close to the smallest majorities of biomass or technomass, the sizes aren't similar at all. I say this because I thought the cube for humans would've been so much larger, since there are around 8 billion. Why are there so much more viruses than humans? These boxes are almost alike in size, but viruses still over power the number of humans.  \n    3. This relates to me and my community because I think it's very concerning to think about the fact that there is more plastic in our Earth than actual humans, and animals. These plastics can be harmful to us, so I feel it's so important for all of us to be aware of this and try to make a difference.

How much do viruses on average weigh?\n    3) This relates to me and my community because the community that surrounds me is full of biological masses that definitely outweigh the mass of humans and buildings that are in the community. I would be very distraught if this was the other way around and we were surrounded by buildings and man made objects.\n    4) \"Humans Dwarfed by Their Own Creations: The Battle of Biomass vs. Man-Made Materials\"",

    "comment info": "A significant detail I noticed is that there is almost as much man-made brick mass as there is bacteria mass. I think that is very interesting considering how much brick there is and how large it is compared to usually invisible bacteria. I was surprised simply by how much bacteria mass there is on Earth. I also notice how little human mass there is. It is shocking to see how much man-made material there is compared to how many humans there are. \n    \n    I wonder how this graph would look if mass of other man-made materials were included like cloth, glass, paper, etc. Additionally I wonder what the comparison would look like between the rest of the matter on earth (naturally occurring rocks and land). I wonder this because while we are seeing the comparison of natural mass and man-made mass, most of the man-made mass is created from natural resources that are not included in the visual representation. Lastly, I wonder what this graph would look like compared to the mass of the bodies of water on Earth.\n    \n    This relates to my community because I can see this comparison around me. The general mass of natural resources is currently depleting due to weather events and human activities. With global warming, it is alarming to see that there is already more technomass than there is biomass. \n    \n    \u201cSmall Humans Create Large Technomass, Outweighing Natural Resources\u201d",

I wonder if you go to the original study (search \"The biomass distribution on Earth\" Ben-On), you would find answers and/or contact information to ask the scientists themselves.  \n    \n    What do you think the ordering from greatest to least of biomass, technomass, mass of water, mass of earth?  After finding out this ordering, what comparisons could you make?  What could you discover?",

    "comment info": "I noticed that technological forms create the most mass when compared to living forms. Humans are notably low on this scale with 0.12GT and the largest mass being 661GT. Technological forms of mass production are about 1,300GT while biological ones are only 1,100GT, demonstrating that technological forms of mass are much more harmful to the Earth due to the greater mass being produced. \n    \n    I wonder if there are cleaner ways to produce technological mass to better the environment. This way we can still provide people with stability in the community while keeping the Earth cleaner to ensure that resources and environmental health don\u2019t deplete too celerity. I also wonder if there are materials that we can make out of plants so that not too many chemicals and masses are being produced that can harm the environment.\n    \n    In my community, many people plant trees and plants that better the environment. However, there are also many building and roads that are built in my neighborhood. With the uprising population, more building and means of transportation will be build meaning that the mass for technological forms will be produced. Overall this will harm the environment and eventually we may run out of resources.\n    \n    \u201cGreen or Machine: A Breakdown of Mass Sources\u201d",

Another surprising thing I notice is that there\u2019s more plastic than animals on Earth.\n    I really wonder why there are more viruses than humans because that doesn\u2019t really make sense to me. I wonder why there\u2019s so much concrete\u2014 almost enough to rival the biomass of plants. My biggest question is how protists, archaea, and bacteria could possibly weigh more than humans. They\u2019re literally microscopic, so that must mean there\u2019s an enormous amount of them on Earth. \n    This relates to me and my community because my generation will keep producing these man made materials until they weigh more than most of the bio forms. \n    Headline: Technological Forms Almost Larger Than Life",

This graph shows masses and not number.  \n    \n    You got that it is unusual, for example, to compare the mass of concrete to the mass of bacteria.  There must be a LOT of bacteria since each one has so little mass.  I envision a balance scale with a chunk of concrete and a kazillion bacteria on the other side.",
