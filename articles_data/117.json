I also took into account that some vehicles consist of both trucks and cars, the majority being cars. The final thing that stuck out to me was that we can live in a reality where gas cars are no longer in use and more \u201cmodern\u201d electric vehicles become the ideal vehicles to navigate.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder what is the future that we live in if electric vehicles are taking over the vehicle industry and as time goes on do we live in a world full of electric operated things or significant technology? \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to both my community and I due to the fact that my surroundings may consist of electric vehicles including the future vehicle that I will one day operate. The future surroundings may also impact the way I decide to go to work, the safety of going on the roads, or the day to day life experienced. \n\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea.\n\u201cThe Future of Electric \u2014 Say No More to Polluted Air\u201d",

However, as the graph projects, once Automakers begin prioritizing and shifting to electric cars, more and more of our 250 million vehicles would become electrically run. However, even the number of electric vehicles wouldn't make up a majority until after 2050. So the earlier we convert to electric vehicles, the earlier the entire population would be affected.\n\nWhat do I wonder?\nI wonder what the logistics would be for all automakers to switch to electric vehicles. Also, what would we then do with gas stations all over the country?\n\nHow does this affect my community?\nThe vast amount of gasoline run cars affects my community because of the cumulative pollution that the hundreds of millions of cars that create damage to the environment (such as global warming, air quality, habitat destruction).\n\nCan I come up with a catchy title?\nI would title this, \u201cA Project for the Environment \u2014 Switching to Electric Cars from Gasoline Cars\u201d.",

Yes, except for the last panel, and that one\u2019s only going to happen if all sales in 2035 are electric- and I doubt that will happen.\nI wonder what the producers of this graph analysed to make a conclusion. After all, you don\u2019t just say \u201cthere will be this many EV\u2019s\u201d; and I wonder if the methods they used are susceptible to extrapolation. A long, long time ago, I believe around 7 to 8 years, Elon Musk did an interview with Khan Academy, saying that the predictions of new technologies are shaped like an S-curve. At first, people under-predict, but near full development, they over-predict. I hope that this is the under-predicting part, because EVs are really good for the environment, and being able to see all EVs, or almost all EVs, in my lifetime would be pretty amazing.\nLast year, I created a sustainability infographic as a school project (NY Times staff, this is not for profit so please do not censor, and I am sorry if any info is incorrect:https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1wn5gtd_sn-B5rCKenD9Jq4gM-JA0dUtAZjCMJvWT3wg/edit). It was dedicated mainly towards electric vehicles, and I learned just how green they were- and most of the time, it was a lot greener than critics liked to admit.

I think this graph is pretty accurate as I have been seeing a lot of Teslas lately on the road. Overall this is great news to me because we all know how bad it is that we are polluting our earth's air every single day. In my eyes this is a step forward for humanity. We are becoming better people and a better human race overall. More people are beginning to use solar powered things and electric cars and I love to see it. It's safe and better for the environment. Also people pay a lot of money on gas every year. With electric cars this is completely eliminated, saving you tonnes of money. I support electric cars and I am happy to see the change we have done.",

It explains that these projections all depend on sales, as in the 2050 section to the right, it has the factor being \"sales of gasoline-powered vehicles would likely have to end by 2035.\" I do support the sale of electric cars, however, as another commeter has stated, these cars are very expensive. However, it is important to give credit to the fact that cars do make up a large percent of pollution in the world today, so the mass use of electric cars would induitably make a difference in the problems we see. In conclusion, we are just seeing a projection, the future isn't certain, but if we get somewhere even close to this, it will be closer to a cleaner environment.",

The graph at the top shows us there aren't even that many electric cars on the roads today and if you go outside you can probably see many of them.

Yes, it will take a lot of time to stop the production and use of cars that require gasoline, however it is one of the only liable solution for the problem of pollution. Car emissions are one of the leading factors of air pollution and switching to a solution that limits this will be extremely beneficial for the environment. It will most likely take time for people to get used to the change. To add, the United States will need to greatly increase electric charging stations, but other then that it is in our best interest to make the change to electric cars for a better future.",

Since I was young, I was constantly told that the gasoline in our cars was a big factor in things like climate change and pollution. So, as I grew up, I was always aware of what was happening to our environment from things that we found to be so normal. I wondered about a possible solution to this, but I was never able to come up with one. Now, as I look around, one of the most major car brands I see is Tesla. Tesla is an electric car. This means that it doesn't use gasoline, so it doesn't emit this into the environment. These cars aren't as much of a danger as their gasoline-fueled counterparts. Since they don't pose as much of a threat to the environment, I think that switching to electric cars from gasoline and diesel powered cars is a great idea.",

I noticed that the years on the graph are counting up by every 5 years.\nI wonder what this graph is used for on a daily basis and why it is significant to use it specifically for this information. I think this impacts my community because the graph is showing by years of how much electric vehicles there will be in the future. This can affect the community in a positive and negative way because firstly, people will get to their work much faster than they did before, and I personally think that people would be more energized just because it would not be such a hassle to wake up every day and drive a regular car. However, people might take advantage of this massive technology and use it for other negative reasons.\nOn the graph it shows that in 2050, the electric vehicles will take over and rule the roads. I think some factors that could impact whether electric vehicles become more available is maybe people will be experimenting with different resources that can make this technology last longer than it should. This is relevant to our generation because technology is a part of our lives on a daily basis, every year, a different technology source is made to make people's lives easier. \nA catchy headline for this graph could be \u201cThe Revolution of Technology\u201d because technology is revolving as the years go by, getting better and better.",

As the graph states, each section represents 250 million cars meaning each individual car represents 637,755 cars. This tells us there are about 1.2 million electric cars on the road or .5% of cars. We can see a steady increase between today and 2035, going from .5% to nearly 11% of cars being electric. This is very different from the near 100% of cars we could see in 2050 if all car sales in 2035 are electric. Even if not all sales are electric by 2035, electric cars will still make up a good number of cars on the road, even if they aren't the majority.\nI wonder what initiatives the government can make to push people to buy electric cars. I know there are tax credits for buying electric cars, but what else might we be doing to get to that second 2050 graph where nearly all cars are electric? Do dealers plan on phasing out the selling of non-electric cars after 2035 or will their sales just be diminished?\nI know in Oregon many people are eco-conscious. I see lots of electric or hybrid cars around and know many people that own them. I know more and more people in the more \"liberal\" or eco-conscious areas of Oregon are pushing for the use of all-electric cars. I saw an ad from a major news broadcast talking about trying to make the state go all-electric.\nTitle: \"Green America: The Future of the Electric Car\"",

I wonder by the time students attend college, how using electric cars would work if they live in dorms, because as far as I know their parked cars will be outside and not indoors where they could charge it. Based on my research from Geology, a greenhouse effect can be composed from renewable and nonrenewable resources. The nonrenewable resources utilizes for example hydrocarbons which which results in oil and petroleum. With its accessibility in the environment, Oil has been connected with occasional oil spills (Oil Spill in Florida in 1977 or many more historical events) that causes harm to the environment. Therefore burning fossil fuels can cause smog air pollution that reduces visibility coming from a mix of smoke and fog) and releases carbon dioxide which is a greenhouse gas into the air. Which is why many scientists wanted to work more on renewable resources like the electric cars that will be become more popular in 2050 because it gives less to climate change and smog than more traditional cars because they create a lower rate of direct discharge.

As the green cars represent the percentage of electric cars and the grey represent the gasoline cars. I notice that today there is a very low percentage of electric cars whereas the graph shows in about 30 years almost all cars sold will be electric. I wonder why car companies are pushing to switch to electricity? Will gas stations go out of business? For some that that would cause a huge issue and have a major impact on many families. Living in an area where you are not allowed to pump your own gas, when gas stations begin to close people that work at them will start to lose their job, leaving so many people unemployed. \n\ntitle: \"All-electric cars in the near future?\"",

Also, I think it would help our environment become less polluted.\nIt will take about 29 years. Some factors could be the number of people who prefer these types of cars, which generation is introduced to these cars, how much of these cars are manufactured. This impacts my generation because we are in between the creation of electric cars and the usage of regular gas running cars so to a certain extent we would start the change. Because it is less likely for people in older generations to start using these types of cars it\u2019s kinda like up to us to start and continuously buy.\nA catchy headline would be \u201c Gas or Glorious\u201d",

Another thing we noticed is that by 2050 statisticians predict that the majority of cars on the road will still run on gasoline. Also, in the year 2050, electric vehicles are projected to make up 60% of new car sales. Finally, starting in 2034, if every new car sold was electric, around 90% of the 250 million cars in the U.S. will be electric by the year 2050. Based on the graphs we wondered When will all the cars on the road be electric, Since there are going to be more electric cars on the road, what kind of charging station will they have or what will they have to change to make it faster like pumping gasoline for electric cars? Lastly, What will happen to cars that run on gasoline? Will they be forced out of business? For the impact on our community, we said fume emissions from gasoline-run cars can be replaced with electric cars for a positive effect on the environment. The limited supply of oil across the world will continue to decrease if we keep driving normal cars in the future, gasoline also is more expensive than recharging an electric car. New electric cars are more durable with fewer repairs than a normal car would need, while them also being a lot quieter than normal cars.

We also wondered what are some of the factors that are causing people to still use gasoline cars, and will people actually be fully using electric cars in the future?

    "comment info": "Based on the data presented in this graph, our group found that less than 1% of all vehicles on American roads today are electric. We also noticed that in 2050, less than half of all vehicles on the road will be electric. If we change all new sales to electric cars by 2035, almost all vehicles on the road will be electric by 2050. In 14 years, the number of electric cars are projected to be 22x's. After analyzing this data, we wondered, what changes will there be by 2035 that would cause the number of electric vehicles used in the US to jump to 13%? Additionally, what needs to be done to achieve all electric sales by 2035? Lastly, what is the power source for electric vehicles and do they involve fossil fuel usage? If they do rely heavily on fossil fuels, can a net zero emission policy still be reached? The topic of electric vehicles plays a big impact on us and the surrounding community. Electric cars are generally better for the environment than gasoline-powered vehicles, so getting more of these on the road would leave less negative effects on the environment. More electric cars means less exhaust that is released to the atmosphere. The air in our community will be safer to intake. We would title this article, \u201cThe Electric Drive.\u201d",

To scale that into proportion, this graph is stating that the roads in 2050 will have over 100x more vehicles on them than they do right now. However, this doesn't mean pollution or hazards things will come from this. In the notes below the graph, it states that up to 60% of projected sales will be electric vehicles. So, even though vehicles are projected to massively grow by 2050, the pollution due to that growth will not match the vehicles growth.\n\nWhat I wonder?\nOn the other hand, 40% of projected sales are intended to still run on gasoline, plus all of the existing vehicles that run on gasoline today. With this predicted growth rate, pollution will spike higher then it ever has a been. This will create an even more toxic layer around our atmosphere which could lead to more drastic global warming problems. If this vehicle growth rate increases our pollution rate as well, due to more gasoline driven vehicles, what environmental issues will arise from it?\n\nWhat this impacts?\nThis not only impacts my self, but the entire country as well. If they are actually able to exclusively sell electric cars by the year 2035, our pollution rate will steadily go down and create a cleaner environment for everyone.\n\nWhat is going on?\nThis graph shows how dominant vehicles will be in the year 2050 compared to today. \n\nHeadline\nRoad Wars: Gas vs Electric",

The first prediction shows how many electric and gas cars will be on the road in 2035. The second prediction shows what the roads will look like in 2050, if 60 percent of car sales are electric. The final prediction shows what the roads will look like in 2050 if all new car sales are electric by 2035. The final prediction is the only graph where most of the cars are electric. \nI wonder which prediction for the year 2050 is the most plausible. I wonder if lawmakers are planning on restricting the sales of gas powered cars, or if the shift from gas to electric is predicted to occur organically. I wonder to what extent a shift to electric cars will help with the issue of climate change.\nThis impacts my community because cars are the main source of transportation in Memphis. We have to drive to get to most destinations, seeing as the city is rather pedestrian unfriendly. The amount of driving we have to do causes bad air pollution.

It will be a long time before that percentage reciprocates.\n\nWhat do you wonder? Will there be like large wastelands full of gasoline fueled cars one day take over? How much of the parts would be reused.\n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community? Electric fueled cars will be amazing, but there would need to be so many more power plants. I hope that these plants don\u2019t rely on the fossil fuels cars \u2018did\u2019\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea.",

There are more gray than green in 3 of the graphs but more green in the last one.  \n2. I wonder where they're getting this information from, and I wonder the reason why there are fewer electric cars compared to gasoline cars.\n3. These data affect our community because it shows that there are fewer cars that are electric or green cars that don't produce pollution compared to the number of gasoline cars that do produce pollution.\n4. The graph represents the number of cars on America's road and each car is equivalent to 250 million cars. The green cars are the electric cars while the gray cars are the one that relies on gasoline.\n5. Future prediction for American roads.",
