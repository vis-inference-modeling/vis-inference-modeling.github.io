Could the school/place this information was collected be an all female area, such as an all girls k-12 school, or a salon.

Assuming these graphs were built on randomly selected teenagers, I feel this data shows not only how boys and girls view each other, but also give insight to why they're choosing the answer that they did.

What do you notice?\n    Most U.S. teens think girls generally do better in school. 42% percent of survey participants said girls get better grades, whereas only 3% said boys do. More students also said girls speak up and ask more questions (34%) and hold more leadership roles (27%). Many teens see both genders to be excelling equally, as the equal section was still the largest in every category.\n    \n    2. What do you wonder?\n    I wonder about whether they conducted the survey's results would change when comparing the different types of schools, like catholic, private, or public, and different regions, since political leaning of the region can impact their opinion. Maybe even grade levels impact this as well due to exposure to more people and maturity levels.\n    \n    3. How does this relate to you and your community?\n    I\u2019ve noticed that girls are more active in class and also take more leadership roles in clubs. I think that boys sometimes hesitate to speak up in class. Looking at the graph, its a reminder to build a community that allows participation in class and leadership roles without gender playing a role, since education is for everyone and shouldn't be 'cool' for only 1 gender to be participating.

    "comment info": "The graph shows what U.S. teenagers ages 13 to 17 think about how boys and girls do in school. It compares who does better in four areas like getting good grades, having leadership roles, being teacher favorites, and speaking up in class. Most teens said girls get better grades, are teacher favorites, and speak up more in class. Boys, on the other hand, were seen as having more leadership roles. A lot of students also said both genders are about the same in most categories. Overall, the graph shows that teens usually think girls do better academically and socially, while boys stand out more when it comes to leadership.",

I notice that for each question asked, the highest percentage of those surveyed thought that both genders excelled equally, the second-highest percentage refers to those who thought girls excel more, and the least percentage thought boys excel more. For example, 48% thought boys and girls speak up equal amounts in school, 34% thought girls speak up more, and 18% thought boys speak up more. This order of percentages from greatest to least is consistent throughout the four categories. \n    2. I wonder how the results would be different if this survey was conducted in the past. Specifically, I\u2019m curious when exactly the shift was from boys dominating the classroom (a safe assumption considering males had historically better access to education) to the perception of girls excelling more in schools, and how the survey data could change alongside the socioeconomic status of women. \n    3. As a female student in high school, it\u2019s interesting and somewhat encouraging that the academic efforts of teenage girls like myself aren\u2019t going unnoticed. Additionally, data such as these could raise questions about achievement recognition in the community. For example, schools might be curious about whether girls do excel more in these categories or if they\u2019re just perceived as more studious and why that might be.

I feel like, according to social norms and how the world works, boys are often viewed as leaders over women, even if the woman is more qualified to lead. This survey is interesting because it shows that at least the group that was surveyed could see beyond social norms, and actually answered the question however they felt.\n    3. At Andover High School, I feel like this is pretty accurate. In most of my classes, girls have better grades and connections with teachers, even though leadership roles and the number of people who speak up in class are very similar.

I noticed that when disregarding the \u201cboth about equal\u201d portion, girls were mostly said to excel in those categories more than boys, except for the \u201cspeak up more\u201d category, where results were more equal. Around 50% of respondents said boys and girls were about equal in all categories except \u201cteacher favorites,\u201d which could be explained by differing personalities in teachers. The survey was conducted between September 18 and October 10, which is early in the school year when teachers and students are still getting comfortable with each other. This could explain why almost half of the respondents in each topic said boys and girls were about equal.\n    \n    2. I wonder if the opinions of those who didn\u2019t answer differed from those who did and if the results are biased. I also wonder if they missed respondents from certain parts of the country whose responses could have been different.

This impacts me and my community because if we acknowledge the perceived gender bias in this study, we can work to ensure opportunities remain equal by educating others.

I also notice that for most categories, the majority of teens see boys and girls as \"about equal,\" but where an imbalance is perceived, it often favors girls. For instance, in \"More leader roles,\" 27% see girls in more roles versus only 16% who see boys in more. The one area where a perceived imbalance favors boys is in being \"Teacher favorites,\" where 16% see boys as favorites compared to only 6% for girls.\n    \n    2. I wonder why there is a perception that boys are more likely to be teacher's favorites despite girls being seen as getting better grades.

The girls do tend to have better grades than the boys, and the boys tend to be slightly behind the girls in almost everything. \n    I wonder why the girls have 27% of the leadership roles compared to the boys, and why teacher favorites come to be more on the equal sides. Although there does tend to be more of the dominant gender that speaks up is almost the same for both. How this related to my community is by taking the data from this graph you can closly be able to get a better understanding of how these genders clode with one another in the school settings.

Gender does not inherently change personality. A second observation is that of the gender differences noted (again a statistical minority of the subjects), there was a larger variance for girls. \n    \n    I wonder if this is principally due to the various gender roles taught to girls in such a misogynistic society such as ours. Some girls are taught to stand by while others taught to stand up. Meanwhile, it has appeared that boys are generally taught without such extremes.\n    \n    To myself, it's a reminder that gender doesn't define anyone, but still can influence our experiences, particularly when we are children.",

For example, in the graphed data under the \"speak up more\" and \"more leader roles\" category, girls overpower the males in percentage by over 10%. Through females' greater social aspect, they thrive in speaking up more because of the comfortability of being vocal. Along with speaking up more, girls play a higher leader role due to their ability to engage and bring people together with their social skills. Overall, females thrive more in school in certain areas because of their higher social abilities.",
