I can tell by the sales from my country in this graph that we'll see more electric cars in the next few years.

I also noticed that the other two countries studied have a higher percentages of electric car sales (around 2022) compared to the U.S. and that both graphs (for the E.U. and China) seem to have a rather large increase/spike in electric car sales right around 2020 and 2021. \n\nOne thing I have questioned was why does the U.S. have significantly lower electric car sale percentages compared to the E.U. and China? Another thing I'd wondered was what triggered such a large spike in the sales of electric cars around 2020/2021?\n\nThis relates to me and my community because it shows me some of America's progress towards being more sustainable/ less pollution as well as the progression of other countries. This is also very important to think about for me because of Hawaii's goals to become reliant on 100% clean energy sources by 2045. The information in these graphs may also help us predict the future for transportation (perhaps more electric vehicles on roads now? One cannot say for certain).\n\nI believe that these graphs are displaying the recorded data about electric car sales in the U.S., the E.U., and in China.

I also noticed that they kinda had similar sales in 2017 and lower when electric cars weren't popular.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder if the graph on the U.S. would be similar to the other countries if it has the same population as them. Could it be the location of the area affecting sales in the U.S.? or did the people spend so much on gas cars they don't want to convert to electricity? It could also be the look or power of the car that is affecting these sales.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis graph is related to me and my community because if we convert to electric cars we could build more solar panels to give areas electricity and cars. This could sustain the clean air and provide energy to low-income houses for free, which would be a great help since Kauai isn't an overly developed place like Oahu. \n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?

Are we going to have a spike soon, or is it going to take a long time to reach where China or even E.U is at? I would think that it is probably due to how we have Uber and other rent-a-car facilities, meaning that a lot of people don't really need a car for themselves. I am curious how people haven't made the switch, and wonder if it is because they aren't as available in stores, or if they are more expensive. I would think, however, that since gas prices are so high, people would be more willing to switch.\u00a0\n\n3. This affects my community because of how much healthier it could be if we used electric cars.

From 2010 to 2016, the percentage of electric cars purchased from the U.S., E.U., and China, were all under 5%. After 2016, the purchase of electric cars began to increase drastically. As of 2022, the percentage of vehicles purchased in China that were EVs came to just under 30%. As for the E.U., their purchase percentage of EVs for 2022 was just above 20%, while the U.S. stays low coming in under 10%. I wonder what was the sudden boom for Chinese electric vehicle purchasers between 2020 and 2021 considering the total percentage rose around 10%. With COVID-19 still being very apparent and production being slow globally, how was the Chinese population receiving these cars? In my community, I see the rise of electric cars more and more every day. Because of rising gas prices and the amount of driving my parents do due to work, in the past year my family has purchased two fully electric cars. I know that other families in my area, with most adults commuting into New York City for work, have turned to electric or hybrid vehicles for their long-term cost-effectiveness. On my annual trip to the West Coast to visit family, electric vehicles have completely taken over on that side of the United States.

I see a more steady rise in the US, but sharper jumps in the European and Chinese electric car sales. I wonder why China had such a sharp jump in electric car users, especially in the last few years. I also wonder why eclectic cars are not selling as much in the US because of the massive driving culture. Americans drive everywhere, so it would seem like a popular idea to have an electric car that does not rely on gas and the money needed for gas. This relates to me because I am a driver and I drive a gas car. There is a strange disparity between the US and other countries when it comes to how popular electric cars are, and I contribute to that. It does seem that China is also a large country, with a similar production structure so it would make sense that the US and China would have similar percentages of Electric car sales.

When looking at the graphs for all three countries, I noticed the same general trend occurring where there was a positive correlation between the year/amount of time and the percentage of sales. This is because for all three graphs, the lowest percentage of total passenger vehicle sales was in 2010 and the percentages increased as years passed with the highest percentage being in 2022. I also noticed that in 2022, the U.S. had the lowest percentage out of the three countries with a percentage of around 7.5%, E.U. had the second highest with a percentage of a little over 20%, and China had the highest percentage of close to 30%. I wonder why China has the highest percentages and why the U.S. has significantly lower percentages. One reason for China having higher percentages could be that many electrical cars are manufactured in China so they have greater and easier access to these cars.

For example, in the EU, electric car drivers pay no purchase taxes or VAT on electric cars, benefit from free parking, and are exempt from all road tolls.

I notice that China has the largest increase in the use of electric cars when compared with the E.U. and U.S. This is interesting as China has a significantly lower poverty rate than the U.S. and electric cars are more expensive than average gas-powered cars. China's emissions/pollution are also more than double that produced by the US. \n2. I wonder why the U.S. data is drastically lower than that of the E.U. and China. This could be tied back to the high poverty rates in the U.S. compared to other countries, as previously discussed. Since China is also a major manufacturing country, the rise in electric cars might be due to their manufacture of them, causing them to promote and sell them throughout the country.\n3. This affects my community since the production of electric cars in the U.S. is continuously growing. If our country continues to transition to electric cars we will be forced to use three times the amount of lithium that we currently have in the world. This could destroy ecosystems, cause water shortages, and many other critical issues. Their production also creates emissions since the materials to create them need to be mined, emitting greenhouse gases. Although this would be an issue, electric cars usually have a smaller carbon footprint than gas cars so this could greatly reduce our country's footprint.\n4.

What do I notice?\n\nI noticed that China not only has a significantly larger quantity of electric cars, they also had a more massive surge in their sales (2020-2022).\n\n2) What do I wonder?\n\nI wonder why they're so much more popular in China and the E.U than in America, because I thought that electric cars were really common here in the USA. I think it's because most electric cars are manufactured in China.\n\n3). How does this affect my community?\n\nI live in the US!

In 2010 it was fairly low for all three countries around the world and since then, the demand for electric models has grown dramatically, with China leading both the US and Europe. I wonder that since China has a large industrial base for production, if that effects the statistics for electric car sales. Additionally, since China has an enormous population, does that effect the sales as well. This relates to my community because more charging stations have become prevalent around the area so it shows the evolution of cars and more people buying them. What's going on on this graph is it is showing not only the difference from 2010 to 2022, but how the US, Europe, and China differentiate from each other in percentage of sales.

The total electric passenger vehicle sales in the US, EU, and China all increased dramatically between 2020 and 2021. The EU also experienced a significant increase in sales in 2020, up around 7% from the year before. The United States had the fewest recent electric vehicle sales in 2022 (8%) while China had the most (around 29%).\n\nI wonder why electric vehicles are so popular in China compared to the United States and the EU. I imagine that the population density of China helped incite the country to adopt electric vehicles rather than polluting gas-powered vehicles. The US also has many highways that are not practical for electric vehicles (due to the vehicles' comparatively low mileage). I wonder if there was an invention in 2021 that made electric vehicles more effective.\n\nThis graph relates to me and my community because I will be buying a car in the future. Hopefully, with more electric vehicles available the price will lower and I can buy the more sustainable model.\n\nThis graph depicts a dramatic increase in electric car sales in the US, EU, and China in the 2020s. From nearly 0% of vehicle sales being electric in 2010 to the increase today, the new technology's popularity is not expected to wane any day soon.\n\n\"Electric Cars: Our Way or the Highway\"",

The U.S section is orange, a different color than the other two which are gray. All three are over the same time period, and start out about the same in under 5% sales. In around 2020-2022, China and E.U. have a strong increase to 10, 15, and even 20+% of sales, while the U.S section only goes to about 7%.

This relates to me because I am turning 16 soon, meaning it's just about a year until I can drive my own car which may be something that was taken down on this graph.

That is approximately a 12 year difference which depicts the increase of electric car sales in those 3 countries, beginning in 2010. I notice that the percentage of cars sold in China is the highest in 2022 at 30% compared to the United States' highest sale in 2022 which is roughly 6% or 7% and Europe's highest sale at 20%. I wonder why the United States percentage of car sales is lower than Europe and China's. Could it be the difference in the economy? I would expect it to be higher in the United States since many are concerned about the climate and electric cars are proven to be better for the environment. It poses the question: Is it because Americans do not want to spend the money in the present state of the high inflation rates of the economy; which raised the price of the electric cars? Overall, the spike in car sales percentage is probably caused by the panic of global warming and the environment so that's why many are buying electric cars because there is no \"carbon emissions from gas cars\".

The total percentage of cars sold that are electric is largest in China, where in 2022, nearly 30% of all passenger vehicle purchases were electric vehicles. In the US, only about 7-8% of car sales are electric cars, and in the E.U., a little over 20% of sales are electric cars. This spike could be caused by increasing awareness and panic over global warming and climate issues, so people could be rushing to buy vehicles that are better for the planet.

I wonder why the U.S.'s percentage of electric cars fluctuated and did not increase every year. I did some research and Tesla reached great popularity in 2017. In this graph, from 2017 on, the percentage of electric cars only goes up. I know the popularity of Tesla must have had a great impact on the percentage of electric cars in the U.S. Teslas are sold in China, however they have a lot of their own brands of electric cars that hold more popularity. China is known for being a lot more technologically advanced than the U.S. so it makes sense that they have a greater amount of electric cars. A lot of people in my community have Teslas. I notice a lot more ads for electric and hybrid cars as well. Brands need to create these envionrmnetaly friendly and economical cars to keep up with their competition.

Then I notice that the U.S. has the smallest percent sales of electric cars between the U.S., E.U., and China. China has the highest number of percent sales of electric cars of all three of the places. Even though the U.S. has the smallest number of percent sales, their sales of electric cars begin the earliest. There is a rapid increase in electric car purchase from 2020-2022.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why so many more electric cars are being sold in the E.U. and China than are being sold in the U.S.? Why are the bars in the U.S. graph orange rather than grey like the other two places bars? I wonder why the electric car sales skyrocket in 2020 after being relatively consistently low in all previous years? does the difference in sales have to do with ads and marketing the product?\n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nBecause the United States has the least percentage of electric car sales, this means that it is still dominated by gas cars. This affects my community because of the pollution that gas cars emit.

This was the second year of the Covid-19 pandemic, and as lockdown restrictions were loosing up, more people began buying cars. However, more people began to choose electric vehicles. I also noticed that the graph starts in 2010. China\u2019s sales nearly double between 2021 and 2022, whereas the United States and the EU\u2019s increase is less dramatic.\n\nI wonder what factors are causing a greater percentage of people in China to buy electric cars as opposed to the U.S. What are the costs of cars in the US, EU and China? What brands are people buying? What are the gas prices in the US vs EU and China?\n\nThis relates to me and my community because electric vehicles are considered to be better for the environment. As the effects of global warming are becoming more noticeable, more people are beginning to buy electric cars to try to mitigate carbon dioxide expenditure from cars. The increase of electric models can help reduce our carbon footprint. \n\nThe graph is representing the trend of an increase of electric vehicle sales from 2010 to 2022, implying that electric cars are becoming more widespread in the US, EU, and China.

In China, electric cars take up over 1/4 of total car sales, so maybe they have more brands or their electric cars are more affordable. If this trend continues, Europe and China will be dependent on electric cars in a few more years. Only 10 years ago, electric car sales were nearly 0, which shows how fast technology spreads and becomes popular over the course of only a decade.\n\n2. I wonder why China's percentage of electric car sales is so high. I generally think of China as being polluted because of all the factories, so maybe people are trying to do something to help the environment. For electric cars to become more popular in the US, I wonder if there would need to be more charging stations in the middle of the country where it is all cornfields and plains. I wonder if the governments are pushing for more electric cars as part of the carbon-free, anti-climate change plans that are going on.\n\n3. In communities with more electric cars, there is less car pollution, making them a cleaner place to live. Electric car sales, I assume, coincide with the wealth of a community because these cars are more expensive. This could increase the disparity between poor communities and rich communities where rich people can afford to live in a place with cleaner air. \n\n4. Revving up for an Electric Car Future",

The graph shows that sales have grown immensely in China from 2020 to 2022. Sales went from only 5% in 2020 to 15% in 2021 and to almost 30% in 2022. The highest and most recent recorded sales in the E.U. was around 20% in 2022 while in the U.S., in 2022 only 8%, from being under 5% the previous year. \n\n2) I wonder in the long term, how will this affect our environment? How will this affect the earth's climate, will we slow down global warming? Why are electric cars so unpopular in the U.S. compared to the E.U. and China? \n\n3) Many people can drive and have cars. As there's an increase in electric car sales, this probably means more people are going to purchase and switch to electric cars. Therefore as more of these cars are used there will be fewer gas-fueled cars, which can help the environment, and help steady the air and climate pollution.\n\n4) Spike in Electric Car Sales!

On the other hand, China leads in Electric car sales although the E.U. and the United States way before China. We know this is caused by the extreme population difference. China has 1 billion plus citizens while the United only has 333.19 million which is a key difference in the amount of sales.\n\nI wonder if China is moving towards electric in order to combat their poloution problem. I also wonder what sparked the uprise and production and sales of electric cars in China . What was the key motive ?\n\nThis relates directly to me because as someone who lives in the United states as car compaines see the electric car sale surge in other countires they will remote to making more electric cars instead of cars that run on gas.

Based on the fact that China's bar graph is higher than that of the United States and the European Union, I can see that, as of 2022, the country has a large number of electric automobiles. In contrast to China, the European Union had more electric vehicles in the second-to-last bar. \n\n2. This raises the question of what China did to sharply boost its sales of electric vehicles when the EU had more in the past. \n\n3. They are attempting to use technology to become more electric, which means that people won't be consuming fossil fuels as frequently, but they still require more solar energy. Perhaps this will lessen global warming. \n\n4. \"Electric Car Sales\" . This graph displays the rates of sales of electric vehicles over time in certain nations.",

From 2010 to 2022, there has been a positive average rate of change, and a significant increase between 2020 and 2022. This is demonstrated in China, where in 2020, only around 6% of vehicle sales were electric cars. In 2022, however, up to 28% of vehicle sales are electric.\n\nI wonder what has caused such a significant uprise in electric vehicle sales in China, especially compared to the US and EU.\n\nThis graph demonstrates the actions various nations or continental areas are taking toward  a more environmentally conscious and economically sustainable world. The uprise of electric car sales indicate a movement from gas, an unsustainable and expensive fuel, to a much more efficient and economically viable option: electricity.\n\nHeadline -\nCharging Ahead: Electric Vehicle Sales Surge in the US, EU, and China",

It demonstrates the percentage of electric model sales in relation to the total (100%) of passenger vehicle sales from the years of 2010-2022 throughout three places (United States, European Union, and China). In the bar graphs, it is clear that in all three places the percentage of electric car sales has exponentially increased since 2010. This is a clear trend. All three bar graphs show a huge spike in electric car sales from 2020 to 2021. I can conclude that this may have been due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic production slowed due to social distancing protocols and people were not traveling as much in their day-to-day lives due to the quarantine. Therefore, electric cars weren't being produced as much and they also weren't in high demand at the time. From this graph, we can see that China has the highest percentage of electric cars purchased.

What do you think are the reasons?   \n\nCheck out another New York Times article \u201cThe Clean Energy Future Is a Battle for Hearts and Minds.\u201d  There you can read many reasons.  \n\nBut, you would also need to examine why other countries get more electric vehicles on the road.  Is it that they capture \u201chearts and minds,\u201d (demand), auto manufacturers (supply) or regulations and laws?",

    "comment info": "1. I notice that while Europe and China have majorly increased in sales (over 20%) over the past couple years, the US has only had a slight increase in sales (5% to 10%). From this information, I believe that we can come to a conclusion that US citizens are less likely to follow trends and buy these stylish cars than European citizens and Chinese citizens are. American citizens may also have a tendency to stick to their \"traditional\" ways while European and Chinese citizens are more open to ideas of innovation.\n\n2. I wonder if it is just an idea of trends or if it is also a factor of money. Perhaps, American citizens don't believe that electric cars are worth the money and so they decide to put their income into something else while Chinese and European citizens believe that purchasing electric cars is a fine financial decision. Also, is it possible that there are not enough amenities in the US for electric cars, while there are gas stations everywhere?\n\n3. I know that my parents who are American citizens do not like electric cars that much due to the fact that you have to charge them. They've heard horror stories of these cars running out of battery and my mom drove one once and she said it gave her a lot of anxiety trying to not run out of battery. \n\n4.

But as the years went on, electric vehicles caught on and began to increase their share of the total passenger vehicle sales, and starting in 2020 skyrocketed. And in 2022 China has the highest percentage of passenger vehicles at approximately 29% followed by the EU and the US.\n2. I wonder why the EU and the US have such smaller portions of their total sales taken up by electric vehicles?
