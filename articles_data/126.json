However in the second map, Western and southern states are mostly impacted by in-state pollution, whereas the middle and eastern coast states are mainly affected by pollution from neighboring states.\n\nI wonder why middle and eastern states are more likely to be affected by pollution from out of state, or what helps them manage in-state pollution better than western states.\n\nThe data displayed in the maps reflect the actual amount of pollution in the U.S. It is important for the community to study why air pollution has become an increasing issue in some states and how actions can be put in place to prevent pollution from developing. Excess amounts of air pollution can lead to other environmental problems, such as global warming and climate change.\n\nMap 1 exhibits the amount of deaths related to air pollution in each state.

    "comment info": "From looking at the two graphs in the New York Times article, I noticed that the eastern side of the country, mainly the coast, has way more air pollution deaths than the western side of the country. I think that this makes sense, as my knowledge tells me that there are a lot more cities and urban areas on the eastern side of the country compared to the western side. This would cause people living in these urban areas to consume more air pollution due to vehicles and factories, therefore driving the death rates up. Along with that, I wonder why the deaths on the western side of the country are more instate, while the western side is mainly due to out of state pollution. An idea that I have for this occurrence is that foreign pollution could be causing more out of state pollution deaths in the east coast. I remember learning about air currents a while ago, and I remember that the east coast is right in the middle of the stream running from China and other parts of Asia. This could definitely bring over lots of pollution.\n\tThis therefore would greatly impact our community. This is because we are living right on the east coast, and would be in the middle of any pollution coming from foriegn continents. This is reflected in the graph, as it shows that the majority of pollution related deaths in New Hampshire are mainly from out of state pollution. A headline I would give these graphs is, \u201cPollution Deaths by State\u201d.",

For comparison to the lower graph, it is interesting to see some of these populations experience higher premature death rates due to pollution outside of states such as New York.\n\nI wonder why the midwest has such low death rates compared to the rest of the map. I assume it is because these urban areas are more prone to pollution by car and other machinery, as well as factories.

Do some states protect their workers more than others, and does that result in less deaths?  In addition to this, I\u2019m also curious about the out-of-state deaths, especially in the northeast.  Nearly every northeast state has more deaths due to out-of-state pollution, besides Ma. and Pa.  \n3. Living in the northeast, this has a major impact on my life and those around me.  As evident by the first graph, the northeast region has the most deaths/10,000 caused by pollution in the country.  This could have effects on those who are more susceptible to illness or other side effects from pollution, as well as my own long-term health.  \n4. \u201cThe Side Effects of Economic Prosperity\u201d",

The more people living in an area and using modern technology means more air pollution. More air pollution means a higher chance of premature deaths. Many of the states to the east of the country have high counts of premature deaths, but it come from pollution that is from out of state. I think this is happening because weather in the United States move West to East. That means all the air pollution from both the west and middle parts of the United States goes to the Eastern half. This could add to the amount of air pollution the east coast already has, meaning more possible toxins in the air, and a higher chance of premature deaths.",

This could be because there is a high use in vehicles and motors, which cause carbon dioxide to enter the atmosphere and damage it. I notice that there\u2019s more states in the darker areas than lighter areas in the map shown. I also noticed that the states that barely have power plants and factories are flat landed areas, for example, Utah.\n\nI wonder what are other ways that air pollution has caused death for many Americans. I also wonder if there is a way to stop doing the things we do that causes this air pollution and lower the risks of people dying from air pollution.\n\nAn impact this might have on me and my community is that it can damage the environment and cause even more deaths- which is something we wouldn\u2019t want especially during the times we are living in at the moment. People should start using more recyclable materials and resources that can lessen the amount of deaths in America by air pollution.\n\n This graph shows the amount of deaths in each state caused by air pollution. The darker the color, the more deaths. The graph gives an explanation towards each state and some of the reasons why air pollution occurs in America. The graph explains that fossil fuels are being burned, which is one way that causes air pollution and carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere.",

However after observing the second graph I noticed that most pollutants in New Hampshire are from out of state sources. Unsurprisingly I also observed that New York and Massachusetts had high numbers of deaths per 10,000 residents. That being said I was then surprised when I observed the second graph and saw that the majority of pollutants in those states come from out of state sources. \n\n2) I wonder what states cause New Hampshire to have two deaths per 10,000 residents and if those states are New York and Massachusetts, why those pollutants do not evenly affect Vermont as they have fewer deaths per 10,000 then  New Hampshire despite being right next to it. \n\n3) This impacts myself and my community as New Hampshire is shown to have two deaths per 10,000 and that the majority of pollutants causing these deaths are from out of state. It shows that even if we as a state reduced our pollutants, people would still die due to the actions of others. \n\n4) These graphs show the number of deaths per 10,000 residents due to air pollution and then go further in depth and show the deaths due to air pollution from either in state or out of state. \n \nA possible headline could be, Air Pollution: The Silent Killer",

It\u2019s interesting to see that California, a heavily populated state has a higher rate of premature deaths than other heavily populated states like Texas and Florida. The population must not be a factor in the rate of premature deaths from air pollution. On the second graph, I noticed that the West Coast has a lot of states that have air pollution caused by in-state. States around Missouri have the opposite problem. California is the darkest blue state, meaning it receives the most in-state pollution. \nWith the first graph, I wonder why California has a larger rate of premature deaths than states like Florida or Texas. Florida and Texas are also heavily populated states but have way fewer premature deaths than California. \nNew Hampshire has a high rate of premature deaths from combustion-related air pollution.

Those states have the big populations than others so that could be a factor of why the deaths are high. Texas has a lighter color although its big population. A likely reason why states like these which have huge populations are on the lighter side may be because of the amount of factories there are. The more factories/companies that cause air pollution may be lower in those states than in California and New York so that is why Texas and Florida are on the lighter side. In the second graph we can see that there are more deaths due to in state pollution than out of state\n\nI wonder why states that border or are near the big states do not have the same impact as the state it borders with such percentages. I would think that these states that border the more impacted states would be in a darker color since air is a factor that carries the polluted air, so I would wonder why those states aren\u2019t affected as much as they should be\n\nThis impacts my community by showing that there is a problem with air pollution in the states.

However, as we are now nearing normality, do you think air-pollution deaths will skyrocket again?",

Overall there are more deaths caused by pollution in the east than in the west. The mid-west seems to have the least number of air pollution deaths. I wonder if there are more deaths just because the population is larger. Are there any cases in which the state population is low, but the death rate by air pollution is high due to other factors such as power plants? I think it's interesting that New York has such high air pollution deaths but mostly out-of-state. Being a very urban state, you would think deaths would be caused more by in-state pollution like California, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. It's also very interesting how states near California don't have high death rates, but the deaths that they do have are mostly caused by in-state pollution. California has both high death rates and much pollution, so I would think that pollution could spread to its surrounding states. I also wonder whom air pollution affects the most - the young, the elderly, or those with respiratory illnesses?\n\nThis impacts my community because pollution is a serious issue. It affects the environment and people's lives. One of the factors that cause air pollution is cars, and I think these graphs provide evidence that we need to push for an electric car future, and if not at least hybrid.\n\nA headline could be, \"Is the Air We Breathe Killing Us?: Air Pollution Deaths in Each State\".",

This graph has shown us that even in Minnesota, we still have a long way to go before we clear up our pollution. Deaths caused by pollution are high in Minnesota, and we could take some ideas from the states with low amounts of deaths caused by pollution to make our state less polluted. A lot of the areas with high pollution are big cities and since MN has Minneapolis and St. Paul we need to be careful to not end up like the other states with big cities. \n\nHeadline: Air Pollution: The Silent Killer",

The number of deaths within Minnesota is fairly high compared to the rest of the United States. We noticed that eastern America tends to have a lot more deaths related to the air quality. We wonder what could be some explanations for this trend. One idea we had is the levels of industrialization across the United States. The more western you go the more barren it tends to be. While in contrast, the east coast is a bit more heavily developed, which may account for the lesser air quality. We believe graphs like these are absolutely vital to maintaining good health.

How can we use the information in the bottom map to combat air pollution within our own states.\n\nCommunity impact:\nI live in a state that is suffers from at least 3 air pollution deaths per 10,000 residents. My state has approximately 8.8 million residents, meaning that there have been about 880 air pollution deaths. The information in the graphs can be used to persuade our governor to make the remediation of pollution a main policy objective.\n\nHeadline: The Polluted States of America",

I see that the states with the most air pollution deaths in the first graph are the more likely in the east and west coasts while the Midwest is a lot less likely. I wonder as to why it is that the east and west coast experiences more premature deaths from air pollution in comparison to the Midwest. My assumption is that since that the east and west coast contain more densely populated cities, it makes sense that those locations are where there are more factories because that is where the profit is. Since that the Midwest is extremely spread out, there are less factories over there that omit air pollution, thus decreasing premature deaths. This impacts my community in a negative way because I do live in a densely populated area with a lot of darker shaded regions in the Northeast. It kind of worries me because our children are more likely to be affected by air pollution than children that are born in the Midwest.

This may be connected to the question you posed, which asks how the statisticians obtained this data. I wonder if California offered the most in-depth data or its large population offered the most representative sample. However, California may be an outlier due to its population density and how data was collected. For example, there may be a greater amount of factories that produce air pollutants per person than in any other state, which will lead to a proportionately higher rate of deaths when compared to other states with different amounts of factories within and around.

As a country we need to stop the air pollution and just pollution itself we need to figure out a better way to try and stop pollution and try to create goods and car factories and oil companies that can create less and less pollution each year and eventually stop pollution all together. More and more sea life is dying and being killed each year because of pollution and people too it can get into our body and harm our vital organs the less we stop this the better the future will be for all of us in the United States and other countries too.

On the contrary, states like Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho have low rates of air pollution deaths that could be from the lack of urbanization and greater presence of open land, flora, and natural landscapes.  \n\nWhat do you wonder?\n\nThe second graph makes me ask a lot of questions. Why does a state like South Dakota have the most out-of-state air pollution deaths? Does it have to do with the underground oil pipeline in North Dakota? Also, let\u2019s look at year-round warmer states like Texas and Florida. Do they have high in-state causes due to the constant use of air conditioners to keep families cool?\n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\n\nThis impacts my community greatly because my family currently lives in Illinois, which is one of the states that has the highest air pollution deaths in the country.
