The TV show, NCIS, was once popular in earlier years. However, this program has somewhat declined in viewership during recent years.

It reflects how shared viewing experiences have changed people watch less weekly television, but they still tune in for events that feel nostalgic or communal, like parades or major ceremonies. I think a good title for this would be, \"Great shifts outlined in the past 10 years\"",

For instance, the tv show, NCIS, was once popular in earlier years but has since declined in viewership, similar to how the academy awards is no longer as popular. However, the Macy's Parade and 60 minutes have somewhat grown in viewership. This data makes me wonder how viewership will continue to shift in the next 10 years. Will the Macy's Parade still be as popular? How will online streaming services effect the popularity of these shows?

    "comment info": "When I look at the graph, I notice that the most popular nonsports entertainment programs have changed a lot over time. In the earlier years, weekly shows like NCIS and 60 Minutes often ranked near the top. More recently, though, live broadcasts such as the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade have taken over the highest spots. The Academy Awards still appear across the timeline, but not as consistently at the very top, which shows a shift from regular weekly shows to big one-time televised events.\n    \n    I think this change has a lot to do with streaming services. Since people can watch shows whenever they want online, fewer viewers tune in to traditional TV for weekly episodes. Live events, on the other hand, are special because they happen in real time, so audiences are more likely to watch them together. Cultural attitudes and changing interests probably play a role too--for example, some people may be less interested in award shows than they used to be.\n    \n    This connects to me and my community because most of us watch entertainment through streaming instead of cable or broadcast TV. We don\u2019t usually watch the same shows at the same time anymore, unless it\u2019s a holiday broadcast or a major live event. That means shared viewing experiences are less common now, and when they do happen, they\u2019re usually centered around big cultural moments rather than weekly episodes.",

I wonder why people\u2019s attention has shifted so much, whether it\u2019s because of streaming, changing tastes, or a shift in the culture. It connects to my community because people don\u2019t gather to watch the same TV events the way they used to.

In the past few years, the most watched has been the Macy\u2019s Parade, followed by Academy Awards and 60 minutes. In earlier years, such as 2014, the Academy Awards were the most watched followed by the Macy\u2019s Parade and NCIS. After 2016, NCIS has fallen off the graph and 60 minutes has risen to the 5-10th spot on the graph. I am not surprised that the Macy\u2019s Parade has risen to the first spot in the past years because it is a popular program and many people watch it on Thanksgiving morning. NCIS is a TV show about agents that investigate crimes, and 60 minutes an investigative journalism show. \n    I wonder why NCIS has fallen off the charts and has been replaced with 60 minutes. Has the show stopped running? Or did people just lose interest and replace it with something else? I also wonder what other programs were the most watched, especially in 2018 and 2020 where the gray box is.  \n    This relates to me and my community because I watch TV and so does my family.

It appears that academy award shows are always in the top three except for 2021, I wonder why this is? I also see that NCIS was popular in 2013 and then started to decline until they were not in the top 10 which happened in 2017. I also see that 60 minutes has become extremely popular within the last three years, as they were just starting to be in the top 10 a couple years before that. I wonder if NCIS had been very popular for years before the graph started and that this graph is only capturing its decline, or if it was just successful for a short period of time. I also wonder why the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving has gotten more popular within the last couple of years, is this because more people have started to watch from home instead of going in person. But I do find it interesting how even though it is only played once a year it always makes the top 10 for most watched nonsport entertainment each year. This relates to me and my community because I used to go to the Thanksgiving parade and now it looks like more people are watching it on tv than going, which changes the experience of the parade.

For example, in the first column of the graph, \"NCIS\" is a very common show that is being watched. However, as the graph gets into more recent years, the presence of \"NCIS\" slowly declines and then fully disappears and seems to be replaced by \"60 Minutes\". I also can see that the Academy Awards held the spot for the most watched for many years in a row, and continued to stay in the top numbers consistently besides one year. Over all these years, it also seems that Macy's Parade has become more popular. Despite all these shows, though, the \"other\" category holds the most spots in the top 10 over the years shown compared to the other programs. \n    \n    This makes me wonder what contributes to a show becoming one of the most watched programs? What contributed to \"NCIS\" practically being replaced by \"60 Minutes\"? Lastly, I would like to know what specific kind of programs fall under the \"other\" category? \n    \n    This relates to me and my community because I know that the Academy Awards and Macy's Thanksgiving Parade are apart of traditions for many people, and are always talked about before and after they happen. Additionally, streaming of shows and movies has become much more popular over the past few years, which could be why the \"other\" category could fill up space. This could also be why Academy Awards is constantly popular. \n    \n    Headline: \"The Fight for Most Watched Program\"",

I\u2019m also wondering if people enjoy watching non sports over regular sports. How does this affect me and my community? This affects me and my community by affecting how people can view these shows knowing that the stats for some of these are lower than others in terms of popularity.

I like how you pointed out the steady popularity of the Academy Awards and how shows like NCIS and 60 Minutes have declined over time. I wonder how streaming platforms might have changed what people watch: do you think the drop in traditional TV shows is mostly because of streaming, or could other factors like audience interests play a role?

I have noticed that many of the programs presented characterize broad strokes of culture, without reigning into anything niche, 60 minutes covers general news, Thanksgiving Parades can be enjoyed by a wide variety of citizens, and Academy Awars pertain to dominant celebrity culture.

The popular Macy's parade is the most viewed, while the Academy is sadly losing drastic amounts of views. NCIS failed to become a top watched show after 2016 as well.

This data can relate to me and my community because it displays how collective activities, interests and broadcasted moments can connect a world and community of people.

I find that even those who consider themselves apolitical, are weighing into politics the more it no longer remains as fodder on the news, but instead a comparable to horoscopes or Hogwarts houses, where one's beliefs are integral to day- to- day communication. Although it might sound unrefined, the creators of South Park made an interesting remark. They said that South Park became more political as politics became pop culture, which might a reason why modern-day politics feels less thoughtful and more like a clow act.\n    NCIS however, may be losing viewership simply because it holds no relevance in the world of streaming, the news is essential and legacy events be streamed will garner millions, but a show on cops that has been running for years when one can go onto Netflix and find a show similar with even better quality, it's hard to desire to stay around.",

On the contrary, I notice that NCIS has declined in popularity significantly. For example, in the latter half of the decade, it does not even make it into the top ten. I wonder how this data was collected and if that affected the results. I also want to know what age group this information was taken from because I think that plays a role in the results. This data relates to me and my community because it serves as a reflection of collective interests and shared cultural moments. It represents shared experiences because many of these broadcasts may be watched in groups, like the Macy's parade or academy awards. This creates a sense of connection and common interest between me and my community. Finally, a name for the graph could be something like \"Academy Awards Dominate! A look into a decade of top nonsports entertainment shows that the Awards are truly unstoppable!\"",
