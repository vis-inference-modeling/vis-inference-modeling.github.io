This impacts my country and community because we are using lots of energy today, and I think using cleaner, more renewable energy for the future will also help with climate change. Another thing I noticed was the variety of clean energy materials and where they were majorly produced in various countries. For example, Cobalt is mainly produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and is not highly produced in China like Rare Earths are.

The first graph is a real eye-opener in terms of these countries actually meeting the goals that were set in that agreement. Out of all of the categories that need drastic improvement is electric vehicles and battery storage. All categories are behind in terms of the goals but electric vehicles and battery storage are about ten million metric tons behind when you compare 2040 under current policies and the Paris-compatible scenario. The second graph shows where clean energy is produced and the percentage of contribution. A major contributor to one clean energy source is the Democratic Republic and they produce around 70% of the cobalt. China contributes around 60% of the rare earth's material. China comes up on the graph several times for producing rare earths, copper, and lithium. Chile, Russia, and Australia also come up on the contributor list several times. The graph showing where these materials are processed is dominated by China. The highest being rare earths at 90% production, which makes a lot of sense considering they produce the majority of rare earth material.

The everyday commodities we use come from these natural resources, such as technology. Under the Paris Agreement, the demand for more efficient clean energy sources increases. Electric vehicles and battery storage would be the most used resource under that plan. Clean metals include copper, nickel, cobalt, lithium, and other rare earth metals. We wonder why China processes the most metals. We also wonder how other countries will move forward knowing they will have to process more metals in the future.

Moreover, we questioned why these metals are produced in many countries that aren't in Europe.\nWe think that these metals play an important role in the future markets of clean energy, therefore leading to a less polluted environment.

It concerned the air quality of the countries that signed it. In the graph the growth of demand in an hypothetical plan in which every country would have fulfilled their goal is shown. We discerned that it was, indeed, significantly increased. \nAs for the wind and solar section we have seen that the change will be minimal, even when considering the Paris-compatible scenario.\nRegarding where those metals are produced the graph shows clearly that the majority of rare earths are from China that produces also a percentage of copper and lithium. \nAs for cobalt, important for the construction of electronical devices, the Democratic Republic of Congo holds the record.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. doesn't actually have an important role in this market.\nConcerning the procession of those minerals, China has the complete control of the sector for every single metal.\nOur country isn't influenced by this dominance that much.

The second two include the different types of metals (copper, nickel, cobalt, rare earth, and lithium) and the percentage that each place contributes.  All of these metals are examples of \"clean energy metals\" which are currently relevant around the world. This is because the world is beginning to buy and produce things such as phones and electric vehicles which require these types of metals to produce. The main thing that stuck out to me in the data was how much China is present in processing metals. I wonder why that is, and if how much they manufacture for places like the United States plays a role in it. Another thing I noticed was that some places contribute to both producing and processing the metals, while others take part in one or the other. The amount of cobalt the Democratic Republic of Congo produces also stood out to me due to how much is produced there compared to places such as Russia that produce little amounts of Nickel and Cobalt.

I also noticed that China is processing like crazy. China is also producing an extremely high percentage of rare earth metals (which are misnamed because they are not actually rare, just hard to extract). I also notice that the Democratic Republic of Congo has a large supply of Cobalt, even bigger than China's supply of \"rare earth\" metals.\n\nWonder:\nI wonder if China will collect so many clean energy metals and minerals that they will take those materials over, and everyone will have to purchase them from China.\nI wonder if the US will catch up with China or at least try to.",

I can also tell you that Lithium Carbonate is poisonous, so if the lithium mixes with something else in the water, you have a problem on your hands. to explain exactly how big a problem that would be, 5 grams of lithium carbonate is fatal to a human being.

Are any other countries trying to get more control of the sources?\nThis relates to my community and I because we are consumers of metals. The U.S. doesn't produce or process the metals, so based on who \"controls\" the materials, the pricing and availability of them changes.\n\"Watch Out For The Force Of Clean Energy Sources\"",

I also noticed that China is the main location where these metals and minerals are processed, which surprised me quite a bit. I do wonder why by 2040, it is believed that our demand for clean energy metals and minerals will only be doubled as of now? While the drastic increase of the electric vehicles and battery storage section makes sense, I believe wind and solar should be a bigger increase, as well as electricity networks. However, I am not an expert in this so I can only imagine why. I am intrigued by this graph because what this graph shows represents all of our future lives. For example, in Canada, they want to have only electric vehicles on the road by 2035, and that is a big change from what I see right now. Although I see teslas and other electric type of vehicles from time to time, it isa very small percentage of all of the vehicles I see on the road.

It would be interesting to see a map of all the metals and minerals found across the world to compare to these graphs. Are there countries missing out on this market? Are there countries that cannot afford to produce these metals? How can China and the US compete when China is so far ahead? Are these minerals being man-made or found in the ground?\n\nThis relates to me because I care about the world and wish for a better future. I hope we can influence our future predictions by changing policies quicker.\n\nMetals Revolutionizing the Future of Energy",

For example, which counties control access and which countries prices these metals, how much is needed for each of the clean energy products and what is the effect on the environment, the local population and the political dynamic of the countries of supply and the countries of demand.\n\nPlease return to this post.  By Friday, we will reveal the New York Times article that included these graphs.  You can learn more about what it happening.",

    "comment info": "I noticed that the first graph contains the current demand for clean energy, the prediction for 2040, and the Paris-compatible scenario which is really interesting. It compares the different levels of expectations and demands and shows how the Paris-compatible scenario may be out of reach for years to come due to the current policies. I also observed in the two right graphs that most metals are processed in China. They also produce the most rare earth metals, showing that China is in the lead for the production of clean energy metals overall. Behind China, Chile is next to compete. However, I also noticed how certain countries chose to focus on specific metals which allowed them to dominate the production of that metal.\n\nI wonder how much China produces every day, and how they do it. I also wonder why only a small amount of countries are included in these graphs. I also have many other questions: What current policies are restricting us from reaching the Paris-compatible scenarios? How much does it cost to produce clean metals and minerals? Can all countries afford too? Why do certain countries choose to focus on specific metals? When will we reach the Paris-compatible scenario? How can we make an impact or change in our everyday lives? I wonder what this will look like in the years to come.\n\nThis relates to my community because our community tries to be environmentally friendly through our everyday lives through many tasks.\n\nThe Race of Clean Energy Metals and Minerals",

    "comment info": "I noticed that the graph on the left shows the predictions for clean energy metals and minerals by the year 2040. The Paris-compatible scenario wants more electric vehicles and battery storage by this time. However, the predicted amount of these materials by the year 2040 is much lower than desired. This displays that the Paris-compatible scenario may be out of reach for years to come. Additionally, I observed that the two graphs on the right side of the screen show where the materials are produced. China produces the most materials, likely implying they have a good system for production. Followed behind China, Chile produces several materials. The Democratic Republic of Congo focused on producing cobalt, resulting in making more of that material than any other country. Australia turned its attention to Lithium, dominating the production of that metal.\n\nI wonder why certain countries chose to focus on more materials than others. I wonder why China is able to produce the mass percentages of materials in each category. I wonder what type of system China uses to succeed in producing materials. I wonder why the Paris-compatible scenario has high hopes for the production of metals and minerals in the next twenty years.\n\nThis relates to my community because everyone tries their best to be environmentally friendly. We do activities including picking up trash around town and correctly distributing our waste into the correct bins.\n\n\"The Demand for Clean Energy Materials Skyrocket\"",

        "comment info": "HI, @Bianca --\n\nUnfortunately, whats these graphs do not show you is who owns the mines that produce the metals.  China owns most of the mines in the Congo.  How does this change the story of these graphs?  Does this maybe explain why China processes so much of these metals?",
