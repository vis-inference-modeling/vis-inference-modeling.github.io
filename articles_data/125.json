An impact that it can have on me and my community is that if they move to my comunnity they can bring these bad and dirty habit around me and others. On the graph it shows the air quality of different cities in one year in 2018 to 2019. It seems that they all relatively stay the same with one or two big spikes but in New Delih it appears that there something wrong because they have had a huge spike in just one year.",

A few cities had mainly safe levels of air pollution, but had some spikes, such as San Francisco. In San Francisco's case, the large spike could be explained by wildfires which will pollute the air for a short period of time. A few cities consistently had higher than 150\u00b5g/m\u00b3. These cities were Kampala, Uganda; Beijing, China; and New Delhi. New Delhi had hazardous levels of air pollution for many days at a time, peaking at more than 500\u00b5g/m\u00b3. I wonder what factors in these cities cause these levels of air pollution, or the absence of it. Most of this does not affect me too much, as my area generally has clean air.

However, it does seem to provide insight into a time that some of us may consider irrelevant.

However, it does show that we can reduce pollution with the right initiative. So, I hope that the community that I am residing in can follow suit.

I also noticed that as for the rest such as Mexico city, Kampala (Uganda), kuala lumpur (Malaysia), san fransico, Beijing, their air quality is Hazardous, therefore they have high air pollution.Overall, Each graph shows the daily average air pollution around different parts of the world ( specifically in the largest cities.) I wonder what do the empty gaps mean in the graph? but how do some cities maintain the quality of their air better unlike other places? What causes the spikes for some cities to contain hazardous air quality?. For the impact in community is that for the health risks in air pollution, there can cause bigger issues globally to climate change and also cause both the youth and elderly to get high risk of respiratory problems. As for a catch catch phrase, would be \"Risky air\"",

Kampala is usually from 50 micrograms per cubic meter to 75 micrograms per cubic meter with a few outliers. New Delhi has exceptionally high levels starting at about 350 micrograms per cubic centimeter and forming a negative slope until the outliers at the end. Bejing starts with an average of 175 micrograms per cubic meter then dropping to about 25 micrograms per cubic meter before rising to 100 micrograms per cubic meter at the end. \nI wonder what causes the spikes in micrograms per cubic meter.

Though it's possible that some countries don't have the resources of wealth to improve their air quality, it is also possible that lack of funding from the government, general misinformation, or lack of information could cause less work to be done. I also am curious what could have caused spikes in air pollution and have hypothesized that the spikes could have been caused by fires or some form of major construction or destruction. I also agree that more needs to be done globally, but for that to be achieved the vast majority of people would need to actively change something that would decrease air pollution whether it be directly such as using less motorized transportation, or reusing old things reducing the number of products produced in factories.",

Does the time of those fires line up with what you see in these graphs? Why do you think LA's air pollution wasn't affected by the fires as badly as SF's air pollution was?\nWhat about other cities with data depicted in this set of graphs?

For example, New Delhi's air pollution is very unhealthy compared to Nairobi Kenya's. \n\nI wonder how the air pollution may affect the people within these communities in the long term. Do people get life threatening illnesses solely because of the quality of air where they live? How can the air pollution in many of these areas improve? Is it possible \nfor them to improve over time even when they reach such high numbers such as 500? How did areas like San Fransisco get their numbers back to good quality?  I also wonder how the pandemic may have affected the air pollution around the world? Did many of these areas numbers improve because of t? \n\nThis impacts my community because living in an area that is densely populated, and close to one of the biggest cities in the world, one can wonder how healthy the air pollution actually is.

The first being that of the various cities, New Delhi had the highest amount of air pollution. Much of the pollution in New Delhi occurs during the winter months. The air in New Dehli often remains in the unhealthy to hazardous range. San Francisco had a large spike in November of 2018, but it has been steady since then. Kuala Lumpur also had a large spike in the middle of seemingly steady pollution rates. Based on these observations, we wonder what causes the air pollution in Beijing and New Delhi to fluctuate so much. We also wondered What caused the large spikes in Kuala Lumpur and San Francisco and how did San Francisco improve its air quality after the spike? Lastly, we analyzed what impact these findings had on ourselves and our community. Air pollution plays a major role in not only our health but also the health of the surrounding community. Furthermore, significant pollution can have harmful effects on the economy, health care system, and decreases quality of life. If the pollution is too bad and causes harmful side effects, population numbers can decrease as people stop moving to the area or move out.

It is also what we breathe in, and that can have serious impact on our health. If I had to wrote a catchy headline it would probably be something like \u201cThese visualizations of air quality can determine where your next vacation spot may or may not be!\u201d",

I do not know a lot about any of these cities, but I was honestly surprised at Manhattan , San Francisco, and Paris since those are major cities and the air was not awful, (even though at times it was nearing Unhealthy territory). Regardless, I did notice the hazardous  spike in San Francisco and  I wonder how that happened. How can something cause such an insane spike and how is it back to good so quickly?\nThis has an impact on myself and a community because the air we breathe has a great impact on our overall health, and knowing something like this can help us navigate where and where not to go, but also can serve as guidance for us to know how to keep our community's air fresh and healthy. \nThere is a lot going on in the graph, ( severe ups and downs and many colors meant to represent the Air Quality, but to sum it up into one headline I'd probably have something like \"You've heard of them, but have you breathed them?: Urban Cities and Air Quality\" .",

I can see that a few cities like Nairobi and Manhattan are in the healthier side, Los Angeles and Paris are in the unhealthy side while Kampala and Beijing are in very extreme air quality areas. I wonder as to why it is that we see these cities struggling with air quality. I can see that Malaysia and Beijing are both in Asia so it makes me wonder if the density of a region has any influence to its air quality, given that Asia is an extremely dense continent. I also wonder as to why is it that Manhattan is fairly well with air quality while Los Angeles is struggling -- why is it that the coasts vary from air pollution? The impact that this has on my community is not a great deal, but it is definitely a good idea to keep an eye on  air quality as a healthy life style. Given that Manhattan and Boston are relatively close areas, I can assume that the air quality is similar and more on the healthy side. Whenever I check the weather for Boston I always see the air quality index towards the green side, which is always a good sign.

New Delhi has the worst air pollution when compared to the other graphs, but Kampala, Uganda is close to meeting their terrible air pollution levels. I wonder why these two places have such poor air quality, the other places show bad air quality at certain points of time, but these two places are constantly dealing with terrible air pollution. At the moment we are nowhere near the levels of New Delhi or Kampala, but we might get there some day and this news is frightening. We need to do something about pollution before our air quality decreases to impossibly low levels. This graph is trying to show how unhealthy the air quality has become in certain places. It shows places where the air quality is good, like Kenya and Manhattan, then it shows places where the air pollution has gotten out of control, like New Delhi and Kampala.

Looking at the concentration and air quality of the country is very concerning especially considering the health of 30 million people living there. This is extremely dangerous with a tremendous amount of people staying there. The second most polluted city that appeared in the graph is Beijing. This is not surprising considering the number of factories surrounding the city. Kampala, Uganda air pollution concentration is also at a very unhealthy level.\n\nWhat do you wonder?  It is very interesting how for some cities like Mexico and Kuala Lumpur, there exists a sudden increase in air pollution for a month or two then decrease to a good amount. I wonder why this happens\n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community? I am from Vietnam, and it is a country very close to Beijing, China.

    "comment info": "I notice that in Beijing and in New Delhi have really bad air pollution and then all of sudden have good air. Also I notice that San Francisco goes bad for a little bit but then all of sudden has really good air. What I am wondering is how are the major cities going from really bad air quality to really bad air quality? What are the doing to change it and make it consistent? I am also wondering why some cities like Kampala, Uganda have an average of having bad air pollution and why are they not doing anything like the other cities. This defiantly gives a perspective that we need to find cleaner ways and other ways cut down on vehicles and chemicals but still have the same way of living. A title I would give this graph would be \"No Fix, No City, More Pollution!\"",

What are they doing that makes their air pollution spike for a short period of time? What are they doing in order to preserve their good air quality? Is there something that they are doing that other cities can also do in order to limit their air pollution?",
