  "raw_comment": "Something that I noticed that’s pretty interesting to me (yet not very surprising!) is that young women tend to reach out to their parents more often than the young men in all three categories. Additionally, I’m surprised to see how often young men and women who do not live with at least one parent visit their parent(s) in person. I was actually expecting to see lower percentages for this category. I wonder how this data would change if the age range wasn’t so wide. For example, young men and women could be categorized as 18-22 instead of 18-34 (i.e. college aged people). I feel like this result in higher percentages for sending texts/phone calls and less visits in person as most young people in college are far away from home. This graph is really intriguing to me! I’m currently a third-year in college and tend to call my parents a lot. Luckily, I’m close enough to home that I can visit pretty frequently though. I think other college students in my community would find this graph interesting as well. I wonder how much other students’ opinions of this graph deviate from mine. Catchy headline: “Texts, Calls, Visits: How Today's Youth Communicate with Their Parents”.",
