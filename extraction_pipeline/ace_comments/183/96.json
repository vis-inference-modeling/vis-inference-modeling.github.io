  "raw_comment": "One thing that I notice in the visualization is that young women, at least the ones included in the survey, tend to be in contact with at least one parent more than the young men included in the survey. This could be due to traditional societal roles, where men are seen to have to not feel emotions and having to be independent at a younger age than women. That if they are in contact with their parents more, they may think they are seen as weak, even though that is not true. I also notice that visiting in person is the lowest for both young men and women, which is most likely due to them moving away for jobs and/or college and they are unable to visit as much. One thing I wonder is how these responses would change by age. The survey questions asked those 18 to 34, a 16  year difference, which is a pretty big considering that it takes roughly 13 years between kindergarten and end of high school. Would the older ones be more or less likely than the younger ones to be in contact with a parent? Also, how does where the respondent go to school or do for work affect their contact status. This graph makes me want to be in contact with my parents more. I am very fortunate to have a good relationship with both parents, one where I could text or call them easily. I do stay in contact with them, but not as often as I think I should. Even a quick 10-minute conversation would be good. A catchy headline could be, \"Parental Guidance – How Young Men and Women Differ in Contact with Parents.\"",
