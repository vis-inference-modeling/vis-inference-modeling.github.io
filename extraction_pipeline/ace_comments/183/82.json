  "raw_comment": "I've noticed that among young adults who communicate with their parents at least once a week, young women tend to do so significantly more often than young men. Specifically, young women text their parents nearly 25% more frequently than their male counterparts. Regardless of the method,  we can see that young women are more likely to maintain contact with their parents compared to young men.\n\nI'm curious how these trends might vary by country, as cultural norms around family connections can differ widely. It would be intriguing to explore these dynamics in different global contexts. Additionally, examining this behavior in older age groups, such as those aged 35-40, could provide further insights. It would also be interesting to see how often mothers and fathers initiate contact with their children and whether similar patterns exist.\n\nAs a college student, I find it hard to keep in regular contact with my parents, but try to do so once every month.\n\nA potential catchy headline could be : \"Staying in Touch\"",
