If your notice makes a claim, where in the graph is the evidence to support it?\n\nI notice that the majority of kids send texts to their parents which it is more convenient and easy. I also notice that women are at higher percentage's for all of them compared to men.\n\n2. What do you wonder?\n\nI wonder why the men don't send more texts or phone calls. I also wonder what age range these people are that answered. \n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\n\nThis has an impact on my community because we have phones that have access to reaching our parents but if we don't use them we can lose connection and relationships with people close to us. \n\n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\n\nDo you not have wifi??",
