  "raw_comment": "I notice that on average, women are more likely to contact their parents multiple times a week in every aspect of communication. I also notice that most young people prefer texting and calling to visiting their parents. Maybe this is because they live far away from them and it is just easier to text or call. I wonder why women are more likely to reach out to their parents than men. Is this just a recent thing or has it been like this for a long time? This relates to me because I feel like I text and call my parents a lot more than my brother does, so the graph is pretty accurate for me. A headline for this graph could be \"Does gender impact communication?\"",
