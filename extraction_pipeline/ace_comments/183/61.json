  "raw_comment": "I notice that young women are far more likely to keep in contact with their families on a regular basis. I also notice that not many young people visit in person and most only text a couple of times a week. I wonder why men do not talk to their parents as much as women. This can relate to my community because I have a 20-year-old sister in college and an 18-year-old brother about to go to college. I wonder if my brother will not call my family as much as my sister does. A catchy headline would be: \"Thanks for raising me... bye\"",
