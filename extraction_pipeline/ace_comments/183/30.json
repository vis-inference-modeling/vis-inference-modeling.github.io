Honestly its expected i can't say i notice too much that blows my mind. my mother is wanting badly to move to florida and im not able to partly for past memories but also i need to stay with my grandparents and when they're gone im going to florida so i can be with my father figure and being 3000 miles away give or take makes it definitely expected that i wont be able to call or visit her 24/7 or even anywhere near that \nHow does this relate to you and your community? it shows that this might be part of the reason people either say they are or are diagnosed with depression because their parents are a huge part of life and you honestly should call them everyday and at least say you love them, life is fast don't let it catch up to you\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\nThe Parental extinction is among us its starting with cutting communication.",
