  "raw_comment": "1. What I notice is that the percentage of young people who claim they talk to their parents at least once a day or a few times a week is shown in this graph. The gap between the number of young women and men questioned and the methods by which participants reach out are also displayed in the graph. I've seen that women communicate with their parents more than men do in every communication category. I also see that texting is more frequently used when it comes to reaching out to parents, while visiting in person is the least common. \n2. I wonder why women contact their parents more than men? I also wonder why people visit in person less? \n3. This is relevant to me and the community because, as I'm sure many others will agree, having personal communication with one's parents is important. Since many people my age, like myself, are already planning on going to college texting and calling parents will be the most convenient ways to stay in touch especially for those who are going out f state. \n4.
