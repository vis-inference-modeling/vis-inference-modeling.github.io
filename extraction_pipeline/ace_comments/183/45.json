  "raw_comment": "I notice that 50% of males say that they reach out to their parents through text at least once a week, while it’s around 70% for females. For phone calls, 30% of males do so at least once a week, and 55% of females do so. Even less percentages visit their parents once a week, with about 20% of males and 25% of females doing so.\n\nI wonder why the gap between the percentages decreases so significantly when it comes to in person visiting, but expands vastly when it comes to texting. \n\nThis relates to my community because the elder community is very important and they deserve to be treated gently.\n\nHeadline:\nMoms aren’t getting their visits.",
