  "raw_comment": "I notice that young men are less likely to reach out to their parents than women do through sending texts, phone or video-chat, or visiting them in person. I wonder if it has to do something with pride with men, or just possible jobs that keep them more busy. This relates to me and my community because I try to reach out to my parents through one or more of the 3 reasons listed on the graph.\nA possible catchy headline would be, \"Being In Contact: How Often Do Young People Reach Out To Their Parents?\"",
