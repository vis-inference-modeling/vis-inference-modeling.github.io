Between 50% and 70% of men and women, text their parents while 30% to 55% contact through Video Calls. In person however, it ranges between 17% and 25%. \n\n2.I wonder if phones affect how many times they contact their parent compared to in person. I also wonder the rates throughout the years to where in person contact will come to an end. \n\n3.This relates to me and my community because my generation grew up with smartphones and everyone is on it. They use phones as avoidance from parents when there is conflict and seem lazy to talk with them maturely in person. \n\n4.Has in-person contact become irrelevant?",
