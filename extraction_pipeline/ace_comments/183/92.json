The least popular method of reaching out to parents was visiting in person while the most popular method was sending texts. The smallest difference between young men and women was in the visiting in person category. \n\n2)I wonder how far the survey participants lived from their parents? Do jobs and college affect the methods of participants reaching out? \n\n3)In my community I know a lot of people around my age that plan on going to college. Depending on future plans some people plan on going to college nearby or going out of state. So, it is interesting to see that one day we may fit into one of these categories depending on what path in life we take. \n\n4)Staying Connected : How Today's Youth Keep Their Parents Involved",
