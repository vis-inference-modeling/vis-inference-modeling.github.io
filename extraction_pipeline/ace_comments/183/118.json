  "raw_comment": "After observing the graph, I notice that young women reach out to a parent at least once a day or a few times a week more than young men do. Additionally, both young women and men reach out by sending texts more than any other type of communication. Visiting in person not only is the lowest for both young women and men out of the other categories, but this category also has the smallest gap between the young men and women. I wonder why men reach out to a parent much less than women do. In all the categories, I noticed that young men had a lower percentage than women. I wonder if there is a reason for this? This relates to me and my community because being in college, me and all my peers do not have much time to reach out to our parents. Additionally, many of us are hours away from home, therefore frequently visiting in person is out of the question. With our busy lives, many of us find it hard to make time to talk to our parents. A catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea is “Keeping in Touch: How Often Do Young People Contact Their Parents?”",
