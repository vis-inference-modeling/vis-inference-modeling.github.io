  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\n\nMore women reach out than men and both men and women prefer to send texts and phone or video-chat, than visit in person.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\n\nI wonder why more women than men reach out to their parent. I also wonder how the different ages in this graph and the different lives of the people surveyed affects the data. For example, done people have good relationships with their parents and some don’t. \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\n\nThis relates to me and my community because it’s very important for everyone to, if they have a good relationship with them, to reach out to their parent at least semi-often because they usually need it.\n\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\n\nParents Were Right: The Phone Does Work Both Ways",
