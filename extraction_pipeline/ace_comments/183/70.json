  "raw_comment": "I notice that in this graph for every category young women reach out to their parents more often. I also noticed that for both genders, texting is the common form of communication with their parents. I think this must have to do with the convenience and mobility of texting, rather than sitting on a phone call or traveling home to see their parents. I notice that visiting their parents in person is the least common way of reaching out to a parent. I think this is because most people 18-22 are away from home at college making it not possible to visit home. And people 22-34 are typically working wherever they can find a job and often that is not in their hometown. \n\nI wonder why women have a higher overall percentage of reaching out than men. I also wonder if the proximity of your college to your hometown plays a role in communication. For example if someone visits their parents a few times a week, they may be less inclined to text or call their parents often. I would also be intrigued to know whether the kids in college in this study communicate more than the people working.\n\nThis relates to me because I am a male in college and I do call with my parents everyday so it is very interesting to see that I am in the minority of all males in the age bracket. I think keeping in touch with your parents is the best way to keep a strong relationship with them as being in college is different from our early lives where we saw them everyday.\n\nKeeping in Touch, Who Does It Best?",
