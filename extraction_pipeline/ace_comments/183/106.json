  "raw_comment": "After I looked at the graph, I noticed that more young women reach out to a parent at least once a day or a few times a week than young men. Based on these observations, I wonder if there is a scientific reason or generational influence behind why less young men contact a parent compared to young women when they live away from their parent(s). The results portrayed in the graph relate to many of my family, friends, and I who are either close to or currently entering college and adulthood which likely involves moving away from our parents and childhood homes. When we reach this stage in our lives, this graph can help predict how often we will connect with our parents through texting, calling, or visiting in person because the samples of people used in the graph are not too distant from our ages, and the experiment is recent.",
