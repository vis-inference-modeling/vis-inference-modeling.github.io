  "raw_comment": "The graph shows the percentage of young adults aged 18 to 34 who reach out to a parent at least once a day or a few times a week. It breaks down the communication methods into sending texts, phone or video-chat, and visiting in person. I noticed that while young women appear to reach out to their families at a higher rate than young men do, regardless of modality, that texting is the most common/ popular means of keeping in touch, as it has the highest percentages in either gender. \nVisiting in person shows the lowest gap between genders,  but is still less popular than other modalities.\nI wonder how the way that female and male children are socialized impacts the way and the frequency with which they stay in parents-- are girls more prone to keeping in touch because they spent more time with parents, or because they feel it is expected? Of the participants that has high rates of contact, how many of them were eldest or only children? \nThis resonates with me as my mom and I text nearly every day. Video and phone calls are harder to line up with different schedules, and in-person visits are the hardest-- we see each other a handful of times each year. Based on this, I'm inclined to think that schedule/ convenience has a decent weight behind the rates observed in this graph.\nI think a good headline could be, \"Texts and Calls: The New Bridge Between Today's Young Adults and Their Parents\"",
