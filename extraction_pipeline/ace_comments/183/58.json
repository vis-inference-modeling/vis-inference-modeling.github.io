  "raw_comment": "I notice that the largest percentage of young people (50-75%) reach out to their parents at least one a day or a few times a week while the smallest percentage visit in person (15-25%). I also notice that there is a relatively large disparity between young men and women's communication habits: women are 20% more likely to send texts or do video-chats than men.\n\nI wonder if more young people reach out via text and video-chat because they are less time-intensive. I also wonder how the data is divided based on age--- are Gen Z young people more likely to use technology to reach out? I am curious if women are more likely to reach out to their parents due to societal expectations and because they are expected to be the caregivers.\n\nThis relates to me and my community because I will not always live near my parents. Instead of seeing them at home, I will have to reach out in order to maintain in contact. The data also indicates a shift in communication methods. Technology is an increasingly important means to connect.\n\n\"Send a Wire: More Female than Male?\"",
