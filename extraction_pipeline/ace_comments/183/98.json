  "raw_comment": "The first thing that I notice is that young women tend to reach out more compared to young men across all categories. I also noticed that as ease of communication increases (i.e less effort/time), the percentage of young people who reach out grows.\n\nOne thing I wonder is the why the disparities between the genders exist. \n\nThis relates to me, as I always try to contact my parents on a frequent basis via text and face time. Many college students are out of state, so it is likely we do not get to see our parents that much\n\nA title could be \"Parental communication: disconnecting to connect\"",
