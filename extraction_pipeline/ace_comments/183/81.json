  "raw_comment": "Right away I noticed that the percentage of young women who reach out to a parent a few times a week is higher than the percentage of men for all types of interactions. Specifically, this gap is largest for sending texts and calling on the phone. Meanwhile, the difference for in-person visits is much smaller (about 5 percentage points). Both genders are more likely to communicate via text compared to any other method.\nI wonder why more women as opposed to men are willing to reach out to their parents. Is it because girls tend to form stronger bonds with their parents? Personally, I text or call my parents close to every day just to briefly check in with them, so this is the case for me. Other college students who also no longer see their parents daily, might not communicate as frequently because they are busy with their classes or work. Furthermore, everyone has a different relationship with their parents, so constant communication might be a low priority for some. I would name this graph “Leaving the Nest Does not Need to Mean Losing Touch”.\n\nOne last note is I wonder if the age range was reduced from 18-34 to instead be only individuals in college or even only individuals in their twenties would these percentages change? It might be interesting to see how when we look into smaller age ranges that encompass specific stages of people's lives, how people's interactions with their parents change.",
