  "raw_comment": "The graph shows how likely young adults either female or male interact with their parents each time a week. It says that they either text, call, or actually talk to their parent in person. The graph shows that they are most likely to send a text to their parents with it being roughly 50% males will text their parents while 75% females will text their parents. The least likely to be done is actually visiting the parent in person with only 26% females and roughly 18%. There is definitely a difference here with males always being in the lower margin and females being in the larger margin. This most likely has to do with the gender differences between males and females.",
