The difference is substantially smaller by 5% points for in-person visits. Texting is the most common way for people of both genders to communicate.\n\n2. I wonder why women contact their parents much more than men, as well as why for the visit in person the difference is not as big as the other categories.\n\n3. Many college students, which forms a big part of my friends and also where I aim to be next year to live apart from their parents, so texting and calling are our primary means of communication. It’s complicated to have time to go back home, if it’s in a different state.\n\n4. Did Technology Change Our Relationships?",
