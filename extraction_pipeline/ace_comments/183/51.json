  "raw_comment": "This graph shows the percentage of young women vs young men who reach out to their parents throughout the week. I noticed in this graph the significantly more amount of women who sent texts, called, or visited in person. I also noticed that the most popular form of communication among both genders is texting. I wonder how far these people live from their parents, especially since the percentage of going home and visiting is so low. This relates to me and my community because my brother and his wife live in South Carolina, and my sister lives in Rhode Island,  while the rest of my family lives in New Jersey. We Facetime them at least 3 times a week to stay in touch. \nHeadline:\nDon't be a stranger!",
