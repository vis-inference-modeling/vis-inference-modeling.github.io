  "raw_comment": "I believe that young men don't contact their parents as much because of the stereotypes of the male figure being able to do it themselves and that they are strong and don't need help from anyone, much less their parents. However there are also stereotypes of the female figure being responsible for taking care of the parents. Personally though, I'm going to be the young man who contacts and sees their parents all the time.",
