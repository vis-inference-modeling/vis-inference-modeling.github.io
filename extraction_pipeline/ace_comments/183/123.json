  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\n\nWhether it be through texts, calls, or, visits, young women tend to reach out to their parents more often than young men. The most common form of communication is texting, followed by phone or video calls, and finally, in-person visits.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\n\nWhat group of people was the sample taken from? Are they college students? Fresh college graduates? What is the age range?\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\n\nA good amount of college students, including me, live away from our parents so our main form of communication is through texting and calling. Finding time to go back home is not the easiest, especially if home is three hours away or in a different state.\n\nCatchy Headline\n\nDialing Home: When Do Young Adults Contact Their Parents?",
