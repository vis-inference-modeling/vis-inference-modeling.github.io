Secondly, I found it interesting that women talked to their parents more, in general than men, as shown on the graph.\n2.I wonder, why young men talk to their parents less than young women. I'm curious why this happens and if it has anything to do with societal gender norms revolving around masculinity. \n3.It relates to me and my community, due to the fact that, it shows that young people are taking less time and effort to contact their parents. As well, if this keeps going on, as generations go on, will the amount of young people speaking to their parents keep decreasing.\n4.Newer Generations Are Barely Interacting With Their Parents",
