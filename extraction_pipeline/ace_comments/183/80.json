  "raw_comment": "I noticed that the graph standardizes the scale of responses by using percentages instead of simply counting the number of responses. This allows for comparison between men and women, which I appreciate since it makes the graph more digestible for non-statisticians. I also noticed the ordering of the three methods of reaching out to convey the most common ways these young adults reach out to their parents. One thing I wonder is why women reach out to their parents at higher rates and how this potentially reflects the relationship that parents have with their female children versus their male children. I also wonder how we could incorporate other questions regarding communication with a parent into the survey as well, such as how qualitative the children believe their communication with their parent is. This relates to me as a college student because I struggle with making time to contact my parents (not on purpose) so I feel as though I cannot have the most interesting conversations with them, but I do believe it is nice to check in with them when I can. Furthermore, since I am away at college, I wonder how many of these survey respondents are college students and how that may affect how often they reach out to their parents as well. A catchy headline is “Parents Back Home: Are You Staying In Touch?”",
