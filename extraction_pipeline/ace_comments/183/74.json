In the graph, young women tend to reach out 75% through text, more than 50% through phone/video chat, and a little more than 25% through in-person. In contrast, young men reach out less than 50% through text, less than 40% through phone/video chat, and less than 25% visit.\n2) I wonder why it is that young women tend to reach out more than young men. Could it be due to the phase of independence? Could a factor be the relationships with parents and young adults? How does the female and male persona tend to affect this result?\n3) This relates to my community and me because many are already in the young adult stage and in addition those are getting to the young adult stage who seem to be eager to explore their waiting and start to find their careers, earn money, and in general figure out the path ahead of them. \n4) Young Adults and Their Astonishing Levels of Involvement With Parents!",
