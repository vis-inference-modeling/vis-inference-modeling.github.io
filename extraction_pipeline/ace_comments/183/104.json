  "raw_comment": "I noticed that males are less likely to reach out to their parents in every category; Sending text, Phone or video chat, and visits, males are less likely than females to communicate with their parents. For sent text Males are at 50% while females are near 70%, Phone and video chat males are near 30% while on the other hand, females are near 55%, and finally for personal visits males are near 20% while females are near 26%. \n\nI wonder if young males think of communication as less of a priority than females do. Does their relationship with their parents affect the response time between the two?   Do they do this to feel more independent? \n\nThis relates to me and my community because everyone around is heavily family-orientated and brought together. There are plenty of family events going on and gatherings weekly. \n\n1,495 Young Adults Are They Really On Their Own?",
