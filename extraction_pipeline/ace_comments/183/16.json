Here are some of the catchy headlines that we received:  “Are Young Men Ghosting Their Parents?” by Tatum of Andover High School in Mass.; \"Parents and Children: How Connected Are They Really?\" by Caroline of Academy of Saint Elizabeth in Morristown, N.J.; \"Family Connections in the Digital Age\" by Alea of Calif.; and three headlines from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo – \"Staying in Touch: Why Do Young Women Seem to Do It More Frequently?\" by Miles, \"Staying Connected: Young Women Lead in Family Communication\" by Hailey and \"Screen Age: How Electronics Have Impacted Parental Communication\" by Aaron. \n\n \n\nPlease return on Friday when we will reveal the free link to the article that included this graph, a summary of the article, additional questions, shout outs for some of the best headlines for the graph and Stat Nuggets -- definitions of words that relate to the graphs and where you can find them in the graphs.\n\n \n\nThis is the second to last graph of the school year.  Please return on Friday when we will release the last graph.  The topic – HOTTER summers.\n\n \n\nSigning off – Sharon Hessney from Boston, who used to write letters home when in college and paid by the minute to call on Sunday at 11 am, and Erica Heinzman of San Diego, who is thankful the days of long distance charges are in the past, though sometimes it is best said on a handwritten card you can treasure",
