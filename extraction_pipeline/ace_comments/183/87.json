  "raw_comment": "The graph displays the percentage of young adults who reach out to their parents. I noticed that young women reach out by texting or calling their parents almost 25% more than young men do. I also noticed that young women visit their parents in person slightly more than young men do. Overall, it appears that texting is the most common form of communication between young adults and their parents. I wonder how these percentages change when young adults move into the 35-45 age range. I also wonder why women tend to reach out to their parents more often and if there is a biological reason for it. \n\nI found this graph interesting because technology seems to impact our communication with parents. I wonder if we are more connected because of texting and calling, or less connected because we can live farther away due to technology. I found this interesting because as a young adult woman, I often see my parents more often compared to some of my peers. Overall, family connection is important for all genders so a good title could be \"Family Connections in the Digital Age\".",
