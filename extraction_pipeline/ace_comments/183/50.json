  "raw_comment": "I notice that there is an apparent difference between the percentage of men and women, with women contacting/visiting their parents more than men. I additionally noticed that the majority of young adults contact their parents virtually, either through texting or calling, with a minority of young adults visiting in person, likely due to long distances between them and their parents. I find it interesting that while women and men are almost just as likely to visit in person, there is a much larger gap between women who virtually keep in touch with their parents and men that do. I wonder what factors contribute to this large difference. I am curious to know what this graph would look like if they provided different, more specific age groups within the young adult category. Given that the survey includes young adults from ages 18-34, I wonder how many college students reach out their parents vs older young adults in their thirties. This graph affects me and my community, as in the next couple of years I will be in college, and I am aware of the importance of keeping in touch with my parents, even if I end up at a school that is not close to home. \"Keeping Connected\"",
