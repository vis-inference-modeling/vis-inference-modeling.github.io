  "raw_comment": "1. What do you notice? If your notice makes a claim, where in the graph is the evidence to support it?\n\nThis graph describes how often young men and women content their parents in a span of a day to a week and in what manner. The responses are split into percentages as well as the two genders and show in what percentage of people each group falls. The 3 methods of communication are texts, calls, and in-person visits with texts being the most common.\n\n2. What do you wonder?\n\nI wonder why women contact their parents significantly more than men as well as why there is such a big difference with the genders in the texting and calling groups but not in the in-person visit groups. \n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\n\nThis impacts my community because I and many of my peers are leaving home soon for college and its vital that we remember to check in on our parents and talk to them now and then.\n\n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\n\nRole shift, today's kids won't let go.",
