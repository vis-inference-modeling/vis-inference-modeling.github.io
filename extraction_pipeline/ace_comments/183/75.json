  "raw_comment": "First looking at the graphic, I noticed that for each form of communication, young women seemed to take the lead over young men in how often they reach out to their parents, whether through text, phone or in person. For instance, young women seem to send texts or talk on the phone with their parents 25% more frequently than young men. It appears that young women and young men are most similar in how often they visit their parents in person, with only about a 5% difference in frequency. Also, texting seems to be the most frequent form of communication for both young women and men. \nSomething I wonder about this graphic is why women tend to reach out more to their parents.  On top of that, I also wonder which parent they tend to reach out to more overall. For instance, I call my mom practically every day to keep her updated on my college life and then she'll just fill in my dad. However, this probably varies from person to person, and it would be interesting to see.\nThis relates to me as a person because out of my brother and I, I tend to reach out more to my parents. This could be because I'm the second child and therefore rely on my parents more for some things, but I also believe it does have something to do with me being a young woman versus my brother being a young man. Between the two of us, we accurately represent these statistics and that tends to go for a lot of boy/girl sibling relationships.\n\"Communication Trends: How Youth Stay Connected with Parents Across Genders\"",
