  "raw_comment": "This graph depicts the difference between young men and women and how likely they are to communicate with their parents daily. Womenare more likely than men to reach out to their parents at least once a day. However, it is mainly digital with just under 75% responding that they text and over 50% saying that they call their parents. Only about 25% of young women responded that they visit their parents on a daily or weekly basis. On the other hand, young men are far less likely to have active communication with their parents. About 50% text, between 25%-50% call, and less than 25% see their parents frequently. I wonder why the percentage of seeing parents regularly is so low. I understand that this poll was asked by 18-34-year-olds who live with either one or no parents, but I feel like this statistic is so low. I wonder how these statistics have changed over time. With the new age of social media and technology, has there been a significant increase in young people who can communicate with their parents daily? This relates to my community because as a teenager, communication is key with my parents and most of my friend's parents. If we do not answer them right away or frequently check in, parents nowadays are prone or getting anxious and hysterical. I wonder in the upcoming generation if these numbers will spike because of the constant communication needed between child and parent. \n\n“Call Your Mom! Young People And Their Lackluster Interest In Talking To Their Parents.”",
