  "raw_comment": "The graph depicts a poll that was administered among individuals, aged 18-34, who do not live with at least one parent. It displays the percentage of young people that reach out to a parent at least once a day or a few times per week, whether over text, the phone, or in-person visits. The graph shows that women tend to reach out to their parents more often than men among all of the communication methods. I also noticed that both men and women are less likely to visit in-person, as opposed to communicating over technology. I think it would be interesting to see a secondary graph that displays the average distance between where those polled live versus where their parents live. If many individuals that were polled live far from their parents, this would be one explanation for why less people visit their parents in person. As someone going away to college next year, this graph relates to me. It will be interesting to see how often I call my parents versus how often my brother does. I would title this graph: “Parental Communication: Women vs. Men.”",
