  "raw_comment": "This graph depicts the percentage of young people who say they reach out to a parent at least once a day or a few times a week. The graph also shows the means by which participants reach out and the disparity between young women and young men surveyed. I notice that in every category of communication, women reach out to their parent(s) more than men. I wonder why this is. Is it just a matter of inherent psychological differences between men and women?  Additionally, I noticed that visiting a parent in person is the least popular method of reaching out to a parent and texting is the most popular method. I speculate that this is because of convenience. Texting is so easy and can be done in a matter of seconds while driving all the way to visit your parents could take hours depending on how far they live. I am surprised texting and calling are not more popular because they are so accessible and easy to use. I wonder how this demographic would change if they surveyed people older than 34. This relates to me because I am going to college next year and will be forced to reach out to my parents because I will no longer be living with them. I will try to contact them at least a few times per week most frequently using text and calls rather than visits. \n\"Message Mothers More!\"",
