Women are at higher percentages than men in this graph. \n\nI wonder Why aren't the men texting more? Why aren't they making more phone calls? What age range are the people that responded?\n\nThis has an impact on my community because we have phones that have access to reaching our parents but if we don't use them we can lose connection and relationships with people close to us. \n\n\nDo you not have wifi??",
