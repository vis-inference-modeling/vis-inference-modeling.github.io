  "raw_comment": "What I notice in this graph is that there are differences in the percentage of whether young people reach out to their parents at least once a day or a few times a week. We observe that there are preferred methods from which both men and women use to reach out. Then there is also variation across gender shown in the graphs. We can see that young women are more likely than young men as a whole to reach out to their parents even across all three methods. However, the strength of this increase is very similar for sending texts and phone or video-chat but not as much as for visiting in person. I wonder why it is that men are less likely to reach out to their parents since it's observed for all three methods.  About 2 in 4 young men who took this online survey who are aged 18 to 34 reach out to their parents at least once a day or a few times a week while about 3 in 4 women do this. Further indicating that the parents of women tend to be more involved in their lives as a result of women reaching out more. This relates to men and my community since I fall into this demographic of young men who don't reach out to my parents very often. This relates to the male community as a whole since it could correlate with the silent epidemic surrounding men as they are more afraid to reach out. Preferring to keep to themselves. A catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea is \"Gender Differences in Parental Communication: Involvement in Their Children's Young Adult Lives.\"",
