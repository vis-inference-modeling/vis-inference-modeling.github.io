Both men and women tend to choose online communication rather than in-person. The most popular way of communication seems to be through sending texts.\n2) Why are women more likely to contact their parents than men are? Does gender play a role? Societal standards? \n3) This relates to me and my community because as everyone leaves for college, staying in contact with parents becomes a question.\n4) How Often Are You Contacting Your Parents?",
