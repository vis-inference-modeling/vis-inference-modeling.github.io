  "raw_comment": "It is interesting there is such a large gap between young men and women in how often they reach out. Generally, women reach out to their parents more. I also notice that the difference between the groups in large for texting and phone calls than it is in person. While in person meeting is definitely least popular, it is surprising that texting and calling is not more popular. I would have expected there to be a higher percentage of people using text because of its accessibility and popularity. I wonder why there is such a large difference between men and women. I also wonder why digital formats of communication are not more popular. Given the culture in the last few years, digital communication is the forefront of connection. It is interesting that the highest usage of texting is only about 70%. This relates to my community because I am a member of the polled demographic. I, along with my peers, use texting and messaging as the forefront methods of communication with out families. This is an indication of how my generation choses to communicate. A possible title is “*buzz buzz* Answer, its your parents!”",
