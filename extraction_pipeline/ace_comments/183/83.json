  "raw_comment": "The graph shows that a higher percent of young women contact their parents at least once a week than young men do. Higher percentages of both genders seem to use text messaging the most and in-person visits the least. It surprised me that less than 50% of young men reach out to a parent at least once a week via text, call, or in person. The question under the title of the graph is \"How involved are parents in their children's lives?\". I wonder if higher percentages of women contact their parents more because parents are more involved in their female children's lives, if young women have stronger relationships with their parents than their male counterparts, or if women are simply better at communicating and staying in touch. This relates to our community because for most college students we are no longer living with our parents and seeing them everyday. Everyone has different family dynamics that affect how often they contact their parents, but maybe gender is a part of this too. What makes this  a good graph to it putting the y-axis label horizontally which makes the graph easier to read. Another aspect of the graph I like is how they used percentages to compare the data. Had the authors used counts or means or ratios, the viewer would have had to more interpretations of their own to figure out the story the graph is telling us.
