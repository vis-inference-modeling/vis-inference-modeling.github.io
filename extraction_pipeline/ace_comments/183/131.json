  "raw_comment": "I noticed that young women tend to reach out to a parent once a day or a few times each week compared to young men as well as, the preferred method is texting rather than something more personal like calling or seeing each other in person.\nI wonder if or how this changes in the future. Do they stop reaching out? Will they start reaching out or communicating with each other more intimately like visiting in person or calling? How does their relationship with their parents affect their response?\nThis relates to me and my community because everyone is constantly growing up and has some kind of parental figure, and is developing into their own person and this can change the ways you interact with each other and your parents.\n\"Contacting the Other- Communicating With Your Parent\"",
