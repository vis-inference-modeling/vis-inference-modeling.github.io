If your notice includes a claim, please back it up with evidence that supports your claim.  By Friday morning, we’ll reveal the free link to the online article that included this graph, shout outs for some of the catchiest headlines and more.  \n\nYou can get a link to your response to share with your teacher and classmates by clicking the response box below your response “Email me when my comment is published.”  \n\nThere is one more graph this school year, which will be released by Friday, May 3.
