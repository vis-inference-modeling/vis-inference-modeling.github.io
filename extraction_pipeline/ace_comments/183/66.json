  "raw_comment": "The first thing I notice is that the percentage of young adults that visit their parents at least once a week was much higher than I expected. I did not expect that around a quarter of all young adults visit in person on a weekly basis because this would mean that around that number live in close enough vicinity to visit frequently. I wonder why the difference between men and women seem about the same for texts and video-chats but the difference is not very wide for visits in person. \nThis is related to me because I fit the age demographic and don't live with my parents; since I'm a college student the people around me also fit these categories.\nTitle: \"How often do Young Adults Contact their Parents?\"",
