  "raw_comment": "1) I noticed that women contact their parents more often than men. In addition, I also noticed that the most common way of communication is through text. \n\n2) I wonder why there is a disparity between the percentage of men that contact their parents compared to women? To what extent do gender roles play a role? Do men have more strained/distant relationships with their parents or is it just a gender difference as a result of socialization?\n\n3) This relates to me and my community because I soon will be a young adult and so will my peers. During this time, we'll start to become more independent from our parents: some will move out, or will just not be as home as often because of college, work, etc. Our lives will become busier so contact might be less. It's important that we try to maintain contact though, even if we're busy because our time with them is limited.\n\n4) Keeping Parental Contact in Adulthood",
