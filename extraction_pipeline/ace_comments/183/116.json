  "raw_comment": "I've seen that young women tend to reach out to their parents more than young men. Young women are the ones who reach out the most in every part of this graph, whether it's text messaging, video conversations, or in-person visits. However, I've noticed that, while young women utilize text messaging and telephone at a larger rate than young men, in-person check-ins are equally popular among young men and women, with around 20-25% of them adopting this method of communication.\nThis trend makes me question why young guys reach out at a significantly lower rate than young women. I also wonder, is texting the most frequent because society has been accustomed to it? \nIt is significant to my community because texting is extensively utilized and an essential component of our everyday life. The graph is equally important for individuals my age, as it depicts a communication pattern. The graph emphasizes texting as the primary mode of communication in today's world, which has become an essential part of our daily lives.\nYoung women take the lead in reaching out to parents in every aspect compared to young men.",
