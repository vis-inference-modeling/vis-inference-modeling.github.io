  "raw_comment": "What I notice is how the percentage of young people who reach out to their parents at least once a day or few days a week is particularly dominated by women. Whether its sending texts, phone or video-chat, or a visit in person, women always tend to do so more then men and some by a large margin. What I wonder is if the percentages have increased or decreased over time by both men and women of how often they reach out to their parents.  Also if visiting in person decreased when more kids started getting phones. What's going on in this graph is it is trying to show the different ways young people will reach out to their parents, characterizing it by gender, and showing the percentage difference between men and women and how men truly do not seem to reach out as much as women. This relates to my community because I have siblings and I think my sister, who is out of the house, and I reach out more then my brother does. We also would tend to see them in person more rather then call or text. \nCatchy headline: \"Incoming call, it's your parents! Accept or Decline?\"",
