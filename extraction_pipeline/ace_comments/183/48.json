  "raw_comment": "This graph shows the percentages of young people who say they reach out to their parents at least once a day or a few times a week. The data is from an online survey of 1,495 young adults ages 18 to 34. I notice that 75% of young women send texts to their parents at least once a day or a few times a week and only 50% of young men do that. I notice how young women send texts, phone or video-chat, and visit their parents in person at a higher rate than young men do. Why is this the case? Could it be because women are more family-oriented? Visiting in person is rated the lowest way to communicate or reach out to parents. Have social media and technology ruined genuine face-to-face conversations? I wonder if it's because the 18-34 age group lives away from home, in-person visits are unattainable. This affects me and my community because I have two older sisters, one who lives away from home and one who is in college and they communicate with my parents over texts and phone calls as it is easier. \nTitle: Connecting with Loved Ones - \"Kiss me through the phone?\"",
