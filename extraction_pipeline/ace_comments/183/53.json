  "raw_comment": "The first thing I notice is that subtitle of the article “How involved are parents in their young adult children’s lives?” Does not match the graphic itself.  The graphic seems to pertain to how involved children are in their parents lives, not vice versa. Maybe it would make sense if the the graphic measured how much parents reached out to students. I wonder if I should be talking to my Mom more, I talk to her every day which seems to be pretty normative based on these results. This relates to me because I fit the demographics of this study and also feel represented in the data. I live across the country from my Mom so do not get to see her often, so I try and call when I can.",
