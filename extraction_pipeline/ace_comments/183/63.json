  "raw_comment": "This graph shows how young men and women socialize with their parents through texts, phone calls, and in-person communication. I notice that women communicate with their parents more than men do in all forms. I wonder if this is because of built-in societal norms for women regarding their role in family and socialization. I also wonder how this chart would compare to a similar chart 30 years in the past. This relates to me and my community because I am almost entering the age range that these statistics are concerning, so it makes me sad that one day I won't see my parents every day. I think we take our families for granted a lot and I hope that I communicate with them on a normal basis when I get older. \n\"Staying Connected in 2024\"",
