  "raw_comment": "After looking at the graph, I notice that young men are significantly less likely to reach out to a parent using text, video chats, or visiting in person. I wonder why young men seem to be more disconnected from their parents? Does it have to do with the way in which sons tend to be raised in comparison to daughters? This is relevant to members of my community who have young adult sons and daughters who do not live with them. This is also relevant to me because, within a few years, both me and my brother will have moved out, and it will be interesting to see if this pattern is present with us and our parents.",
