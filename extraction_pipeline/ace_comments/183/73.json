  "raw_comment": "I've noticed that, generally speaking, women are more prone than males to communicate with their parents many times a week. It's also apparent to me that the majority of youth would rather text or contact their parents than see them.\nI'm curious to know how these answers might vary with age. Given that it takes around 13 years to complete high school and enter kindergarten, the survey's age range of 18 to 34 represents a 16-year disparity. Would the likelihood of communication between the older and younger children with their parents be higher or lower?\nThere are a lot of individuals my age in my neighborhood who intend to attend college. It's intriguing to realize that, depending on the course we choose in life, we can eventually fall into one of these groups as someone who is leaving home rather far away. \nHow Do You Get in Touch With Your Parents?",
