  "raw_comment": "1) I notice that in all categories young women are more likely to reach out than men. Young people most likely tend to reach out to a parent by sending texts, while they are least likely to visit in person. There are also noticeable gaps between the percentages of women and men. While for sending text only under 50% of young men reach out, just under 75% of young women send text. There is also a noticeable gap for phone or video-chat as only around ~30% of men reach out while over a little 50% of women do in contrast. Visiting in person had the least difference around 5% with percentages of 25 and under.\n\n2) Why are young women more likely than men? How would these people describe their relationships with their parents? \n\n3) As the family is a big part of many people's lives while we all may not be able to see all parts of family in person,  there are alternatives to reach out as we live in a modern digital world. Hence it may not always be convenient to visit in person, we can make phone calls and send texts. \n\n4) Going Digital: Keeping in Touch with Loved Ones",
