I also notice how young women send texts, phone or video-chat, and visit their parents in person at a higher rate than young men do. \n\n2- Something I wonder is if social media and technology ruined genuine face-to-face conversations? Or is it because the 18-34 age group lives away from home, in-person visits are unattainable.\n\n3- This relates to my community because I fit the demographics of this study and also feel represented in the data. Also, I get along with nearly everyone I am surrounded with on a regular basis, am in the age range this graphic examines.\n\n4- \"Are you chatting ?\"",
