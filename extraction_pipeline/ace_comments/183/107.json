  "raw_comment": "I notice a clear difference in how frequently young adults reach out to their parents based on gender. On average, young women maintain more consistent communication with their parents compared to young men, with a significant gap observed in electronic forms of communication such as texts or calls. The discrepancy remains even when considering in-person visits, albeit to a lesser extent. This disparity could be particularly noteworthy during the college years, a period which is known for creating a newfound independence for many. This makes me wonder how different these statistics would be different if the age range was narrower. It seems fair that young adults, especially those in college, would reach out less to their parents as they feel  more independent, but is this trend truly as evident past college years? This analysis is significant for me and my community as it highlights the importance of regular communication with parents, especially by a young male adult within this age range. It makes me want to reach even more as a college student myself and truly keep my parents involved with my life away from \"home\".\n\nHeadline: \"Is Parental Communication a Common Priority?\"",
