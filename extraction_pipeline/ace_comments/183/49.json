It is interesting to see that less than 25% of both of them visit their parents in person often. It is also interesting to see that less than 75% send texts, as that is a very easy action to do even just once a day. I wonder why girls communicate with their parents more than boys. This relates to me and my community because as a young woman I communicate with my parents and I wonder if the amount that I do that will change as I get older. I would name this graph: \n\"The Curve of Kid Conversations\"",
