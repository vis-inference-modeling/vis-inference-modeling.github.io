  "raw_comment": "This graph shows that only half of men reach out to their parents once or a few days a week. While nearly 75% of young women do reach out to their parents every week. I wonder why women are more likely to reach out to their parents. A statistic that stands out, and relates to my community, is that less than a quarter of young men and women actually visit or reach out to their parents in person each week. I understand this statistic as it probably gets harder to find the time to visit your parents in person when you may live farther away or have a job. So sending a text to your parent every week is a simple and easy way to stay in contact.",
