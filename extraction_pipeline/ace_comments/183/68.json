  "raw_comment": "The first thing I notice is how the highest percentage of people reaching out to a parent is still less than 75% at best. It's young women over text who get the closest to 75%. I imagine that this is still a bit less than many people would hope. Another thing I notice is how the smallest gap appears with visiting in person. I suppose that visiting in person has less to do with gender and more to do with location. I wonder how they find the time to visit in person at least a few times a week, since even if you live relatively close, it can be hard to find the time to do so. And if someone did live that close, I wonder why they wouldn't just live with their parents to begin with. \nThis relates to me and my community as I'm a young college student living a few hours drive away from home. I'm more likely to text than to call, but I still often times call about once a week. \nI would name this graph \"Young Women More Likely to Call Mom than Men\", or \"Most Kids Prefer Texting their Parents, Not Calling\".",
