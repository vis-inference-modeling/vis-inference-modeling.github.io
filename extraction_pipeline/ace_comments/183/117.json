  "raw_comment": "I notice that overall, young women tend to reach out to their parents more often than young men do. The difference between men and women visiting their parents in person is fairly similar, with women only visiting their parents in person about 5% more than men. The difference between men and women reaching out to parents via text, phone, or video chat is much more significant. It seems to be about a 40% difference, with women having the higher percentage. I wonder why exactly it is so common for women to reach out to their parents more often than men. There seems to be some sort of association between gender and parent relationship fostering, but the graph makes me wonder what exactly is causing this significant difference. I also wonder why there is such a drastic difference in face-to-face visits versus texts or calls. For a relationship as important as one with a parent, I would normally assume that people would place more emphasis on in person visits, but this graph is causing me to think otherwise. This graph relates to me and my community because I identify as part of the group of young women who does not live with my parents. As a result, I have to make an effort to foster the relationship I have with my parents, updating my life through calling and texting. In person visits are less frequent simply because of physical distance between our homes. A catchy headline would be \"Young Adults are Children Too- Reach Out to Your Parents!\".",
