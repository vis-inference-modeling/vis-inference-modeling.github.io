  "raw_comment": "I notice that the percent of people who contact each other in person is so drastically smaller than the percentage of people who just text each other.  This makes me wonder if the reason for this is that we have the opportunity to just see them on social media and update ourselves on their lives by their post so why talk to them. This relates to my community because I think that we are a pretty outgoing community but even in my own home I see the distance between my friends and our parents due to our phones and texting. \nTitle being… “texting vs. humanity”",
