I also noticed that voting in person has the lowest percentage compared to the other forms of communication. \n\nI wonder how big of a difference it would be comparing states or with other countries. I also wonder if this is due to whether or not they were coddled or if kids didn't have a good relationship with their parents. \n\nThis relates because since I am going to college soon, if I dorm I would be contacting my parents more often then if I was at home and this goes for other seniors too. \n\nHow Often Do You Call Your Parents?",
