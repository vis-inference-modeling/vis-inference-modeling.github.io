I notice how the title is \"how involved are parents in their young adult's lives,\" and the data does not relate to it. I wonder why not many more people send texts because they're so easy to send. I wonder why young women generally communicate with their families more. It relates to my community or life because I am going on to college next year and staying in contact with my family is very important to me.",
