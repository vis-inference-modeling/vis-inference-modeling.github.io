But a commonality both have is preferring to send text messages while visiting in person might be a last option. \n\nI wonder what factors were looked at to choose the population for this study. Factors such as how far people lived from their parents, how good their relationship is with their parents, their job situation, if they're fathers/mothers themselves, etc.\n\nThis relates to me and my community as my community is very family oriented. This means it is very common in my community for people to reach out to their parents whether its call, text, or in person. But as my senior class transitions to college , in person contact will become more limited as we will start using texting and phone calls to communicate instead. \n\nHas Technology Caused Communicating to Become Completely Digital?",
