  "raw_comment": "1. I've observed that younger women tend to contact a parent once daily or a few times weekly, in comparison to men who do so less frequently. Additionally, texting appears to be the preferred mode of communication over more personal methods like calling or meeting in person.\n2. Will they start reaching out or communicating with each other more intimately like visiting in person or calling? \n3. This is relevant to both me and my community because as we all mature, we each have some form of parental guidance, and as we develop into our unique individuals, our interactions with each other and our parents can evolve accordingly. I personally make sure to make it a habit to stay in consistent communication with my family, especially my parents. \n4.\"Connecting Generations: Navigating Communication with Parents\"",
