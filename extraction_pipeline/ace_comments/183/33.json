  "raw_comment": "From the graph, I noticed that young women more frequently contact their parents at least once a day or a few types a week than men. Also, out of the forms of communication, most young people contact their parents through sending text messages at 50% for young men and 75% for young women. This is interesting because text messages could be considered a faster form of communication than phone/video-chat and visits in person. I wonder if more young people prefer sending text messages to their parents because it is fast and convenient. Why do the amount of young people that contact their parents often vary between men and women? I wonder if young adults closer to the age of 18 that were surveyed reached out to their parents more or less than young adults closer to the age of 34. How many young adults stated that they do not contact their parents and were screened out of the survey? This graph relates to me because I am 18 years old and when I move to college this year, I wonder what form of communication I will rely on the most to contact my parents. How will my age impact how frequently and what source I contact my parents? This also relates to my community as it can demonstrate the closeness of parent–child relationships and young adult’s dependence on their parents in adulthood. \n\n“The Importance of Text Messages–In Young Adults’ Contact With Their Parents”",
