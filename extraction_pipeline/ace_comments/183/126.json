  "raw_comment": "I notice that, in general, more young women tend to reach out to a parent than young men do. In every aspect included in this graph, whether it’s sending text messages, video chats, or visiting in person, young women are always the ones to reach out more. However, I also observe that while text messaging and calling have a disproportionately higher rate of use by young women than young men (around a 40 percentage point difference), in-person check-ins are equal amongst young men and women, with around 20-25% of them using this form of reaching out.\n\tThis observation of mine makes me wonder two things. 1) Why do young men reach out at much lower rates than young women? And 2) Why is reaching out in person used very little compared to other forms by young adults? \n\tThis graph relates to my community and me in that most of the people in my inner circle are around the ages depicted in this graph, especially young men. Because of the observation that young men are almost twice as likely to not reach out to their parents, it’s a slight concern for me as to why my young male peers and friends are reluctant or hesitant in doing so.\n\tCatchy headline: “What’s Your Form of Communicating With Your Parents? Do You Do it at All?”",
