  "raw_comment": "From first glance, it can be noted that it is more common for young women to communicate with their parents throughout the week. The statistics for all three categories for women combine to over 100%, suggesting that many young women not only frequently communicate with, but utilize several different methods, to talk to their parents. This is much higher compared to men, where the sum of all 3 categories barely reaches 100%, meaning that young men do not as regularly communicate with their parents. This may be because, according to societal standards, women are raised to be more mindful of their family and are meant to be more sensitive to the physical and emotional needs of those around them. Men, on the other hand, are raised according to the social conception of masculinity to become independent and less openly emotional or communicative in their relationships, meaning that young adult men will be less likely to maintain a close relationship with their parents.",
