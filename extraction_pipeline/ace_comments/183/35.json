In general, it is more likely for young men and women to reach out through texts with about 50% of young men and about 70% for women. Overall, women are more likely to contact their parents than men. \n\nI wonder how this may affect the future generations when reaching out to parents. If communications between children and their parents become less likely, is it more likely for crimes to increase? Most children depend on their parents for decision making, to educate them and lead them on the right path but if communications decrease significantly most children can begin to depend on themselves.\n\n Most children depend on their parents for decision making, to educate them and lead them on the right path but if communications decrease significantly most children can begin to depend on themselves and that can lead to complete chaos.\n\nYoung People Reaching Out: A Viewpoint on Generational Shifts in Parental Relationships",
