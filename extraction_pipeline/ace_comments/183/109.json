  "raw_comment": "I notice that young women tend to reach out to or visit their parents more than young men but texting seems to be more frequent than actual speaking. I wonder why women tend to reach out to their parents or family more and why men maybe don't value these relationships as much? This relates to me and my community because as high school or college students progressively get older, they tend to lose contact with family and become wrapped up in their own separate lives. A catchy headline could be \"Do women tend to care more about family connections and communication?\"",
