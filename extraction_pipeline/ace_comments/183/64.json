  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\nYoung women tend to reach out to a parent more, in texting, calling, and visiting in person\nThe difference between young women and young men reaching out is similar for texting and calling, but the difference is much smaller for visiting (which requires a larger time and resource commitment). \n\nWhat do you wonder?\n- Girls are socialized to be more family-oriented and social. Is that a cause of the “gap” between young men and young women reaching out?\n- What do these gaps look like in various types of parents? (e.g. single mom, single dad, two moms, two dads) \n- What are the percentages of young people who reach out to immigrant parents vs. native-born parents? \n(Young people with immigrant parents may reach out not only for social purposes but for practical purposes such as helping with taxes and bills written in English.\nNon-Western cultures tend to be more family and community-oriented than the more individualistic Western cultures)\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nMy dad helps my grandparents with their healthcare, taxes, and bills because they don’t know English well. He has been doing this since he was a kid when their family immigrated to America. \nI have a very healthy relationship with my parents; I text them almost every day and call them weekly. Some people I know who have weirder dynamics with their parents reach out much less. \n\nHeadline:\nGender Disparities In Young Adult Child Communication With Parents",
