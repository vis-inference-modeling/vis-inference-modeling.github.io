  "raw_comment": "As a college student, striking a balance between complete independence and parental contact can be a difficult task. While I personally enjoy my own space and distance from my family, I understand the importance of reaching out in a consistent manner. One thing that stood out to me was the fact that women tend to reach out to their parents more than men among all 3 communication methods. This made me wonder if males tend to view reaching out to parents as an \"intrusion\" into their independence. \n\nThis analysis is extremely relevant, as I am close in age to the ages investigated. Understanding this data can help tell us more about more than just preferred modes of communication with parents, such as why women tend to reach out to their parents more than men. Analyzing this type of data helps us formulate better questions to ask about our social environment.\n\nA good title for this graph would be, \"Reach Out to Your Parents: Are Women Better Communicators?\"",
