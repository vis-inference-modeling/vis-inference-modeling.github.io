  "raw_comment": "This graph provides fascinating insights into the communication habits of young adults aged 18-34 who live independently from their parents. The data highlights notable differences between genders in their preferred methods of maintaining regular contact.\nAmong young women, texting emerges as the dominant mode of communication, with 100% reaching out to a parent via text at least once a day or a few times per week. In comparison, only around 75% of young men exhibit the same texting frequency. Young men show a higher inclination towards phone or video chats, with approximately 75% using these methods regularly, as opposed to only about 50% of young women.\nInterestingly, despite the prevalence of digital communication, a significant proportion of both genders, roughly 25%, still prioritize in-person visits with parents at least once a day or a few times weekly. This underscores the persistent value placed on face-to-face interaction in fostering close family ties. \nThe data presents a nuanced picture of a generation navigating independence while striving to maintain strong parental connections. \n\nAn interesting title may be: The Talk: Do Young Men or Women Talk More with Their Parents",
