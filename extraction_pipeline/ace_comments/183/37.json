  "raw_comment": "1. What do you notice? If your notice makes a claim, where in the graph is the evidence to support it?\nI notice that young women are more likely to reach out to their parents compared to young men, and that texting is the most common form of communication. \n2. What do you wonder?\nI wonder why visits in person are the least likely form of communication given that most young people live with their parents. \n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis has an impact on my generation since we are all going to college very soon and shows which type of communication is most used for those who don't live at home and for how I, a young woman, am most likely to interact with my parents when I don't live at home anymore. \n4. What's going on in this graph? \nAre young men ghosting their parents?",
