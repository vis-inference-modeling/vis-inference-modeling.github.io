  "raw_comment": "The first thing that I notice is that young people need to talk to their parents more often! They’re not going to be here forever. I also noticed, and thought it was interesting, that girls tend to keep more in touch with parents than boys. I found that a little relatable. I still try to keep in touch with my parents, but I feel like younger boys might have more trouble doing that. I also saw that the percentage of young people who see their parents in person was the lowest out of all. Life does tend to get busier the more you grow older, and you might not live in the same place.\n\nI wonder and hope if we could get to a time where we really try to put an effort into seeing our parents and family. There’s only a certain amount of time we get with our loved ones, and it’s important we spend that time and cherish it while we can.\n\nThis relates to my community since I’m currently at college, just like all the other students here, and we may not see our family all the time since we’re away for school. It might be hard to make frequent calls, but I’m able to get a couple a week in.\n\nA catchy headline would be “Connected But Disconnected”.",
