  "raw_comment": "Young women reach out to parents more overall as compared to young men. While only less than or about 25% of men and young women visit their parents in person at least once a day or a few times a week, more accesible ways of connection like Texts and calls show an even greater divide between the interaction of young men and women with their parents. \n\nI wonder if tradititional gender stereotypes affects how often a young person will reach out to their parents. Young men are typicall societally encouraged to be more independent and not ask for help as often, while women are expected to lead more domestic, family-centric lives. Does this phenomena have even deeper roots, such as biological instincts unique to each gender?\n\nI have a very close relationship to my parents as I am the only child and only daughter. A lot of my family friends are adults who only have boys, and I am their “honorary daughter”. It’s frequently mentioned how much more I reach out to them, and that “parenting a girl is very different.” \n\nDaughter’s are the favorites for a reason!",
