  "raw_comment": "The first thing I noticed about this graph is the fact that the appearance of the first leaf for the most part went from South to North at a relatively steady rate.  This certainly makes sense, since the Southern parts of the country are closer to the equator, and therefore, they are warmer.  However, I wonder why the areas in the Midwest saw their first leaf in May, a month or two later than many states that are located further North.  The animation of the graph really brings this to the attention of the person studying it, because the areas of the Midwest are the last parts of the white map to be colored in.  A good headline for this graph could be \"Springing to Life\" because it displays the gradual process of leaves and trees that are blooming to their fullest potential in the country.",
