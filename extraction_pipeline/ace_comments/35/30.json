From my background knowledge I know that the closer you are to the equator the warmer weather that location would have. Additionally, I would assume leaves grow in warm weather which Arizona and Washington are warmer. However, plants need sunlight so maybe some of Washington got more sunlight than New Mexico and Arizona.\n\nName idea: \nAloe Spring!",
