It ends in May at the top of the states.\nI wonder why the May 'First Leaf' ends up halfway across the United States. I also wonder why they don't have Alaska and Hawaii. I wonder why the 'First Leaf' shows up faster in some places than others.\nThe story of this graph is telling what time spring is coming in areas in some spots.\n A catchy headline for this graph could be \"May Flowers: An Evolution of Spring.\"",
