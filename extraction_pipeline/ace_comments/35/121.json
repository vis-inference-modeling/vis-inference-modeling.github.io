This is a combination of generally warm weather, the new spring season, and how cold the weather in each respective territory remains throughout the early spring.  I wonder if global warming has a significant effect on how quickly or slowly the leafs appear on the trees, and further, flowers or fruits on the trees.  A title for this  graph could be \"May Flowers: An Evolution of Spring.\"",
