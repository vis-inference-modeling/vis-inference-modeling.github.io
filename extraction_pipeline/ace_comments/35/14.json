This is most likely because the southern states are warmer, and are closer to the equator.  And the northern states hit spring later because of the snow, and climate we have, and the area we are in.  For example, the western region has the Rocky Mts, which would change the climate, air pressure and more, therefore making their region hit spring in May.",
