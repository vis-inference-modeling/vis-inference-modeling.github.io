Another thing we noticed is Wyoming and Colorado was the last states to have the last spring sign, the two states were mostly covered, but they had a little bit left that was white after all the other states were covered. \nWe wonder what states will be fully covered first next year. Another thing we wonder is why some of the states are half covered by one color for one month, and the other half is covered from another month, like example, California. \nWhat we think might be going on in the graph is that it is showing us the first sign of spring, and how long it can take other states to have a first sign of spring based on where it is located.",
