  "raw_comment": "This graph illustrates the time periods in which regions of our country saw their \"first leaf,\" an indication that spring has sprung! The first thing I noticed was that the more south a state is on a map, the earlier it sees its first leaf. This makes sense as the more south a state is, the closer it is to the ecuator, making it warmer. I do wonder however why certain regions in the midwest experience spring later than others. It's a very disorganized pattern, too. The creators of this graph were very creative in terms of the animation they added as it shows the progression of states that experienced spring. A good title for this graph could be \"I can't beLEAF spring is here!\"",
