  "raw_comment": "Hi, We are a third grade class from Juneau, AK, and we are learning how to read infographics. \n\nWe noticed: \n- This map did not show AK or HI. :( \n- The title told us this graphic was about leafs falling.\n- The first leave appearances moved from south to north (mostly). \n- May leaf appearances were very spread out and small. \n- February has 28 days. \n\nWe wondered: \n- Why there were so many colors? \n- When the first leaf appearance is for AK and HI? \n- Why does May look the way it does? \n\nA catchy title we thought of was \"As the Leafs grow.\" \n\nThank you for reading our thoughts!!",
