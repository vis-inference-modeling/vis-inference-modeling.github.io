This is a nice visual in explaining how being closer to the equator causes leaves to spring sooner. I do wonder, however, about the impacts that cause coastal and landlocked areas to have leaves sooner or later. For example, I see coastal areas sprouting leaves early even if they are not necessarily the most southern regions.",
