We also notice that towards the left side of the graph by the Rocky Mountains it has the latest times for the first leaf.  We wonder if this is because of the higher elevation located in that region which could lead to worse conditions for such growth.  What's going on in this graph is the estimated and recorded times of the first leafs seen, those leafs indicate that spring is coming",
