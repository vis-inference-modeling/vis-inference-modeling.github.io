  "raw_comment": "This graph Is showing the average \"first leaf\" appearance throughout the United States. I noticed that it seems the that some of the south shown in green sees there first leaf in January and as moving up it from the green region from January to April. So it is showing that the southern points see the the first leaf first and as you move norther the months are April and may. This makes sense because the southern areas are relatively warmer. I wonder why the midwest areas don't see the first leaf appearance until around May. A catchy headline for this graph could be leafing up. Showing from the bottom to the top of the map the leaves showing up.",
