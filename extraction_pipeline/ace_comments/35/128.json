  "raw_comment": "Wow! This is the first interactive graph I have seen on this learning platform. It is quite fitting since spring has sprung! I really enjoy this visual because it led me to notice that the areas of the United States that are colored first are closest to the equator. I wonder why the purple colored areas have leaves appear after the the yellow colored areas, considering they are lower, closer to the green colored states. I also am curious about why the West Coast has such varied colors. I never realized it took approximately five months for all 50 states to experience spring, with its fullest leaves. May 31- in my New Jersey-mindset- is closer to summer. A catchy phrase for this time lapse could be \"The Coloring of America: A 5 Month Process\".",
