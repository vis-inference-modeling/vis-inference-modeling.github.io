The growing buds soon spreads northward on the eastern side of the nation as the state of California blooms into spring. The last place in the continental US to have its \"first leaves\" is the mid-west, which represents that the mid-west stays colder for the longest amount of time in the Continental US. A good title for this graph would be \"Blooming into Spring\".",
