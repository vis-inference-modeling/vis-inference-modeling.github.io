The leaves seem to start appearing at the bottom of the graph (the south) and move up (north). The leaves begin to appear in the south first due to the warmer climate in the south. I notice that leaves begin to appear in parts of Washington and Oregon before other parts of the north so I wonder if certain parts of those states have a warmer climate earlier in the year?  A title for this graph could be “ Springing into Spring\"",
