  "raw_comment": "I notice that the United States' electricity generation has barely raised at all since 2000 (with gas and wind/solar power taking much of the share from coal), while the world's total generation has raised by well over 10 million gigawatt hours (GWh). China's generation alone accounts for about 8 million GWh, with India accounting for about 1 million GWh. Furthermore, we see that worldwide nuclear generation has barely moved at all, while hydroelectric looks like it's about doubled. Wind and solar has gone from no generation to about 3 million GWh, gas looks like it's about doubled from 3 to 6 million GWh, and coal has risen from 5 to about 8 million GWh.\n\nI wonder why China's generation has increased so much while the United States remained so similar. China has certainly been developing, but more than quintupling their electricity generation seems absurd. What were they doing before they were generating it themselves? Were they importing all of it? I also wonder why no new nuclear energy is being produced when we know how safe and reliable it is.\n\nAs the world looks to move towards renewable energy, we see that fossil fuel consumption is still only increasing worldwide. With climate change impacting the world more and more, we are seeing more extreme weather like the polar vortexes that sweep across the US in winter, plunging the Midwest into wind chills below -40 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\"Electricity Generation in China Soars to More Than Double the United States\"",
