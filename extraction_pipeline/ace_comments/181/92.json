  "raw_comment": "The graph shows the world electricity generation from the year 2000 to just beyond 2020, with sources split into \"clean\" and \"fossil\". Coal, gas, oil and other fossil fuels are represented alongside nuclear, hydroelectric and other clean sources such as wind and solar. There's a visible trend showing a decline in coal use, a relatively steady production from gas, and an increase in wind and solar energy generation over time.\n\nI'm curious about what is behind the decline in coal usage and the increase in wind and solar energy. It could be technological advancements, economic factors, or policy changes. \n\n\nThis trend reflects a global shift towards more sustainable energy sources which could be influencing local energy policies and infrastructure. Our community is experiencing changes in energy costs(PGE keeps going up!),  so this may reflect,. or be shifted by an increase in renewable energy. It was interesting to see that the US is relatively stagnant for clean energy compared to china.\n\nI would call this graph, \"The Rise of Renewables: Wind and Solar Power Surge Forward in the Global Energy Mix\"",
