If your notice makes a claim, where in the graph is the evidence to support it?\nI notice that nuclear and hydroelectric electricity is increasing especially in 2020 but coal and gas still take up a big chunk at the bottom.\n2.  What do you wonder?\nI wonder if we are making a new change and switching to more electric electricity's rather than gas and coal. \n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis relates to my community because we use a lot of gas. \n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea. Is clean enegry taking over?",
