  "raw_comment": "I notice that we have added no meaningful nuclear capacity in the last quarter century despite it being an incredibly easy fix for both massive power generation needs and essentially zero carbon emissions. And there is a class of \"environmentalist\" that actually fights FOR that outcome. And we can thank them for the concomittant absolute (if not percentage) rise in coal and other fossil fuels to meet growing energy demand.\n\nSolar is great, but nuclear is a magic bullet that's been around for decades and has only improved since. We are being foolish.",
