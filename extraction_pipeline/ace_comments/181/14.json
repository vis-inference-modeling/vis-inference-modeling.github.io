  "raw_comment": "All types of electricity generation have been on the rise in terms of total electricity produces since the year 2000. Of the forms of electricity generation, clean energy produces the most, with nuclear and hydroelectric electricity taking the #1 and #2 spots. Among fossil fuels, oil and gas produce the most electricity, but not nearly as much as clean forms of energy such as in nuclear or hydroelectric forms. \n\nI wonder how the total electricity generated for each form of generation depends on the energy production of each country. China seems to be on the rise and most likely will still continue generating more and more electricity, with a high emphasis on fossil fuels. The USA has remained rather constant, and is interesting because there seems to be a downtrend in fossil fuels. Could this be because they source fossil fuels from other countries?\n\nI live in the USA, and so the graph showing the forms of electrical generation in the US is interesting to me. It shows that gas has been becoming the main source of electrical power for the US, as well as coal. Clean forms of energy generation like solar power have only contributed a speck to the total energy production, despite it being made a huge deal nowadays.\n\nHeadline:\nEnergy Evolution: Transitioning from Fossil Fuels to Clean Sources",
