  "raw_comment": "I noticed that the world’s electricity generation has significantly increased in the last 20 years, almost doubling from about 15  to 30 million gigawatt hours. The graph also depicts how the world still relies heavily on fossil fuels for more than half of its electricity generation, with coal and gas usage slightly rising. On the other hand, clean energy usage has increased with wind and solar power accounting for a higher proportion of electricity generation.\n\nThe other graphs depict how diverse the composition of electricity generation is in various countries. For example,   the US population is relatively small compared to China and India, but the amount of energy generated by India is much lower than the US. \n\nThe graphs create many questions including the reasoning behind the fluctuations in world electricity generation. There are dips in certain years like 2019 and 2008. I wonder if the decline in 2019 could be due to the COVID-19 pandemic and if the dip in 2008 might relate to the economic recession.\n\nSince living in California I have seen a shift in energy consumption just in my hometown. In the last few years, there have been decisions to decommission oil rigs off the coast and developments of new battery storage systems that are working towards being emission-free. Overall, the graphs help depict the story of how electricity generation has changed over the years, therefore a catchy name could be “The Megawatt Movement”.",
