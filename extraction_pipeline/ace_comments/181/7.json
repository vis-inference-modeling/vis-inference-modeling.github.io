  "raw_comment": "I've seen that the production of power has been rising over time. In addition to coal being the main source of emissions that may harm the environment, clean generators are becoming more and more common. I could also see that China generates twice as much power as the United States and more than five times as much as India.\n\nI wonder how we can ever rescue life on this planet given that people are addicted to non-sustainable lifestyles, that the fossil fuel business and electric utilities are primarily concerned with gaining power and profit, and that the government is frightened to take the necessary steps to regulate the answer.\n\nThis is relevant to my community because everything runs on power, and we need to take care of it by maintaining a healthy, non-toxic atmosphere and stocking it with clean supplies.\n\nA Whole New Era of Eco-Friendly Power",
