  "raw_comment": "The graph depicts the world electricity generation, which has been increasing since 2000. In the past 20 years, the usage of clean energy has increased significantly. China uses a great deal of energy, most of which comes from coal. However, since 2000, China has increased their usage of clean power. Conversely, India has used much less energy. In 2020, they used around 2 million gigawatt hours of electricity. I found this surprising, as India is a heavily populated country. But, I wonder if the poverty in India may have impacted the results of this graph. This relates to my community because fossil fuels are harmful to the environment. Through this graph, we can see that countries like China are using a large amount of fossil fuels. It is important that nations around the world try to shift towards cleaner energy. I would title this graph: “Changes in the World Electricity Generation.”",
