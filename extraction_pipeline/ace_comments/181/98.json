  "raw_comment": "1. I noticed that China has had a much steeper increase in their electricity generation compared to the US and India. The world itself has also seen a steady increase in their electricity generation with wind and solar becoming a bigger contributor to electricity generation since 2010. \n2. I wonder why China has seen such a big increase in electricity generated compared to the US and India. I also wonder what could lead the whole world to use more clean power than fossil fuels to generate electricity and what the next 20 years will look like. \n3. From these graphs, it looks like the US is trying to move more towards using clean power with their increase usage in wind and solar to generate electricity. If the US also stays at a steady rate in which we generate electricity, we could potentially see clean power replacing more fossil fuels to generate electricity. With that being said, this can create a cleaner way on producing electricity. \n4. How the world's generation of electricity has changed over the last 20 years.",
