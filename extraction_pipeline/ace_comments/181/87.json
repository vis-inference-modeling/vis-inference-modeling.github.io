  "raw_comment": "First examining the “World electricity generation” graph demonstrates an evident increase in electricity generation with fossil fuels dominating a majority of the sources of that energy. Of the clean energy, it’s interesting to note that hydroelectric and other is the greatest source of clean energy compared to nuclear and wind/solar. Of the fossil fuels, coal is the greatest source of fossil fuels compared to gas and oil (and other). Another intriguing thing to note is that clean energy seems to be increasing faster than fossil fuels, however, with clean energy sources taking a bigger share of the total world electricity generation as time passes. I wonder how this increase in clean energy will affect the countries’ totals since China seems to follow that trend of clean energy’s greater share of the world total, but the United States’s and India’s totals seem to be changing at slower rates than China’s. With the rise of clean energy, I hope that statistics like these cause us to reflect on how our communities and we use electricity and where our electricity is coming from. I strongly hope there are more talks especially regarding sustainability when it comes to unrenewable sources of energy such as fossil fuels. A catchy headline could be “Our Energy Sources are Electrifying the World - 2000 to 2022”",
