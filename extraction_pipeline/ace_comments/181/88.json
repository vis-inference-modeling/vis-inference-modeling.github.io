  "raw_comment": "1) I notice that the world's electricity generation has significantly increased throughout the years. Fossil fuels surpassed 15 million gigawatt hours and renewable sources of power present a positive increase that surpassed 25 million gigawatt hours. Countries like China, the U.S., and India differ in the amount of electricity generation used, the U.S. demonstrates leisurely decreasing its use of fossil fuels while slightly increasing the use of renewable power sources. As China uses the most clean energy out of the U.S. and India they also use a large mass of fossil fuels. On the other hand, India demonstrates the use of the least clean power and fossil fuels under 2 million gigawatt hours. \n2) I wonder how the economy plays a role in the use of electricity generation, China and India a both largely populated, yet India's low electricity generation greatly contrasts the use of electricity generation in China and the U.S. From analyzing how the use of electric generation greatly increased in 20 years how could the data differ in the future? Will we maintain the use of clean power on top?  \n3)This relates to my community and me because we as a community contribute to the use of the world's electricity generation, making the resources we use contribute to either the negative impacts that fossil fuels or the positive impacts of using clean energy/power. \n4) Our World's Powerhouse: Clean Energy and Fossil fuels!",
