  "raw_comment": "The first thing I notice in the first graph \"World Electricity Generation\", is that over time there has been an overall steady increase in both clean and fossil fuel gigawatt hours. I additionally noticed that even over time, coal and gas, both very harmful to the environment, are still the most used. I wonder if gas and coal are more affordable, in comparison to clean electricity. In regards to the second group of graphs, I noticed all three countries given have very different graphs. China's graph shows a very steep increase in electricity generation. The United States graph displays a consistent generation of both fossil and clean electricity. India's graph shows very little generation of electricity at all. I wonder if the generation of electricity is affected by the country's economy or level of technological advancement. All three of these countries are all very populated, so that could be why they all still rely on fossil fuels. This relates to me and my community, as it is important to acknowledge the need for clean energy to preserve our environment. \"Clean Countries or Coal Countries\"",
