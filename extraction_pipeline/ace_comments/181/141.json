  "raw_comment": "I notice that the US is using less coal than other countries like China. I also notice that wind and solar seem to be making their way into the picture. They started gathering traction around 2010 and now it’s made a decent sized impact with the use of it similar to nuclear. I wonder how long it will take for wind and solar to become very predominate and surpass coal and gas. Will it take 2 or 3 decades? I think the community would do better on a more sustainable form of renewable electricity. If we can see an increase in hydroelectric, wind, and solar, then this will be very beneficial. A catchy headline would be “The generational switch in Electricity, Lump of Coal to Solar and Gold”.",
