  "raw_comment": "The main thing that I notice is the widths of each of the stacked sections of the graphs. The thing that immediately stands out is the increase over time for the Wind and Solar section across the past decade. Also while coal is also increasing, it is noticeably slower than the increase in Wind and Solar. Looking at the country graphs, what stood out to me was the U.S.'s apparent stagnation in overall production of energy when compared to India and China. This is also combined with a marked reduction in Coal production which is in stark contrast to China which seems to have not slowed down on their coal energy production. \nI wonder why the US and China have such different overall energy profiles. Why is China's production rising at such a rapid rate while the US's has been stable for the past 2 decades?\nThis is significant to my community because how our electricity is produced directly affects our lives. Cleaner energy production means cleaner air which is overall better for human health. Also, in my area there are currently questions regarding a nuclear power plant that is reaching its EOL. Whether or not it's shut down might affect things like energy prices locally but also contributes to the overall landscape of energy production in the US.\nTitle: \"Global Electricity Production Continues to Rise\"",
