  "raw_comment": "When looking at this graph, we notice that it is about electricity. Nuclear, Hydroelectric and other, and wind and solar, are increasing more than coal and gas, which have remained similar gigawatt hours each year since 2000. It is interesting to see that the clean electricity is rising more in recent years as compared to the fossil electricity which is at a slower increase. I wonder if this will continue to happen, and if the fossil electricities such as coal or gas will begin decreasing in the coming years. I also wonder the reason for the difference in inclines when comparing clean and fossil electricity. This relates to me and my community because these me and the people around me are users of electricity in several shapes and forms. We all use it every day and it is important to be educated on it.",
