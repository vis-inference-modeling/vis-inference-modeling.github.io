  "raw_comment": "What I notice:\nCoal has consistently been the largest source of global electricity generation, though it has declined slightly since 2010. Gas, wind and solar, and other renewables have been steadily increasing since 2000. Nuclear and hydro have stayed relatively flat over the 20 year period. Fossil fuels (coal, gas, oil) still make up the vast majority of electricity generation compared to clean sources.\n\nWhat I wonder:\nHow much have total global electricity generation amounts changed over this period? The graph shows share but not absolute amounts. What explains the slight dip in coal around 2020 - was it due to the pandemic reducing energy demand? How much variability is there between countries and regions in the electricity source mix? How are these trends projected to change in the coming decades as renewables scale up further?\n\nImpact on me and my community:\nThe still-dominant share of fossil fuels has major climate change and air pollution impacts that affect the whole world. More renewables means cleaner air and reduced emissions, but also potential economic disruption in fossil-dependent communities. The trends point to the need to massively scale up clean energy investment and infrastructure in my community and globally.\n\nHeadline: \"Coal still king as renewables rise in powering the world\"",
