  "raw_comment": "There are 2 graphs displayed here. The first graph displays the world electricity in the clean category: nuclear, hydroelectric and other, wind, solar and the fossil category oil, gas, and coal from years 2000 to 2020. I noticed there was a large increase in the use of cleaner energy and fossil fuels in recent years. I wonder how those environmentalists or those who care about the environment feel about the increased use of fossil fuel emissions and how that affects the environment. Does using clean energy help? The second graph below depicts the total electricity generation graphs for China, the U.S. and India with the year range of 2000 to 2020. I notice that China produces the most coal and India produces the least. I wonder why China produces more fossil fuels than the US and India and how that affects the environment and pollution. I wonder if population has an affect on the mass production of fossil fuels in China and India's because the current population in both of those countries about 1.4 billion each. With the same population you would think they would produce the same amount of fuel. This relates to me and my community as my dad owns an electric car which is environmental friendly and I have been more aware of how much fuel and gas costs affect the world around me. \n\nTitle: Gasolina",
