  "raw_comment": "Within the World Electricity Generation graph, I notice that the electricity generation in all the given categories increases from 2000 to 2020. It is evident that more electricity is being generated now compared to 20 years ago. However, I also observe that the growth of fossil fuels has been much slower compared to nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, and solar electricity generation methods.\nI genuinely wonder how much further the total electricity generated can rise in the upcoming future until it reaches a possible limit. I am curious whether overpopulation could lead to a scarcity of resources to generate a sufficient amount of electricity for the human population.\nThis impacts the way my community and I must think about preserving energy. Excessive use of the world's fossil fuels deteriorates the cleanliness of our planet. We must strive to keep the Earth clean to ensure that future generations can live comfortably on it. A catchy headline could be \"Will the Earth Be Safe with These Electricity Generation Methods?\"",
