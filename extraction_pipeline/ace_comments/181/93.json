  "raw_comment": "1. Immediately, I noticed the overall upwards trend of the graph, and how from 2000 onwards, there has been a huge expansion of the amount of energy used. However, the majority of this expansion of energy is resulting from clean energy, as coal, gas, and oil, have somewhat stagnated throughout these 20 years.\n \n2. What metrics or units are being used to \"color\" the different types of energy - does a different color relate to how \"clean\" the energy is or how \"fossil-ly\" the energy is?\n\n3. Although I currently live in SLO, I primarily grew up in a town that uses hydroelectric energy. I know that the amount of energy that can be produced by hydroelectric energy is substantial, and although it is not underrepresented, it is interesting to see such a small portion of the graph taken up by hydroelectric energy.\n\n4. ZAP! Energy Production by Energy Type:  2000 to 2020 (gigawatt hours)",
