  "raw_comment": "Although the text states that these graphs do not include imports and exports, they most likely do not reflect the complete amount of energy generated by each nation. The overall consumption of any of these nations would be higher if they were net importers of energy, and lower if they were net exporters. \n\nI wonder what factors play into the fact that India's energy usage is so low compared to China and the united states', I would expect it to be lower compared to those two but that low?\n\nThis is important to my community because, as I become older, technology becomes more and more integrated into every part of life, leading to a greater usage of electricity. Environmental preservation may be achieved by the widespread use of clean power generation.\n\nPOWER POWER POWER AND MORE POWER !",
