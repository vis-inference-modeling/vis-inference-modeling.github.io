I also wonder why India having the largest population does not have the most energy. \n\nThis relates to my community because I live in the U.S where is considered to be one of the countries that produces the most amount of energy. So this can affect the amount of pollution in my area because of the energy usage. \n\n“Clean energy or more energy” This graph shows the amount of fuel and the pollution of energy that is made.",
