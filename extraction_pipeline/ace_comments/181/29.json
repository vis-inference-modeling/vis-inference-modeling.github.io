I notice that solar energy has significantly increased since 2000. Oil and Hydroelectric have stayed steady, and I wonder if that is because of their limited capacities as a resource or their accessibility. This applies to my community because the use of fossil fuels can impact the earth and our environment for years to come. \nname : \"ENERGY\"",
