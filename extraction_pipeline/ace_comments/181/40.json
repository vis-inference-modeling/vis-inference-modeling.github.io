  "raw_comment": "These graphs are very intriguing to me, as I have recently been learning a lot about wind and solar energy. Overall, the first graph shows the huge amount of energy consumed across the globe. Energy consumption seems to be on a rapidly rising trend, and although it does not show up to 2024, I am sure the trend will continue upward. I was shocked at how low India's consumption was considering the huge number of people they have. India is more populated than the US and uses significantly less energy. China is similar in population to India but uses so much more energy. I was also surprised that nuclear energy is clean energy. I feel that the only things I hear regarding the word 'nuclear' are negative, so it is surprising that it is associated with something I think of as good and helpful like clean energy. I would title these graphs \"Energy Consumption: Where does your country fall?\"",
