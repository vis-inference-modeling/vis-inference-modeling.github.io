  "raw_comment": "I see a rise in electricity generation and a positive correlation with years in these graphs. I noted that, as the graphs of China, India, and the US demonstrate, this increase is not necessarily uniform across all nations. China's electrical production expanded year after year between 2000 and 2020 at a high linear pace, while the US increased only slightly throughout that time. I can also see that each nation uses coal as its main source of electricity generation, but over time, the US has been using less of it while the other two have both been using more. \n\n I wonder how the United States has managed to maintain steady electricity generation in spite of economic and population growth. Although China has a much greater population, the huge difference in electrical generation is still confusing. This raises the question of whether environmental laws and regulations are in force in nations other than the United States.\n\n\nThis relates to my town since switching to renewable energy offers many advantages, especially in terms of lowering air pollution and enhancing general health for a large number of people.\n\nHow do China, the U.S., and India generate their electricity?",
