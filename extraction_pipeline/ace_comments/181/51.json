  "raw_comment": "In this graph, it is measuring the amount of world electricity generation from different types of clean and fossil fuels in gigawatt hours over the years 2000-2020. I noticed that for every type of fuel, there was a general increase in the amount of gigawatt hours of electricity generated over time. I wonder if this is due to advancements in technology for each type of energy source. Also, I noticed that for all 20 years, the clean energy sources had the highest electricity generation with nuclear being the highest reaching over 25 million gigawatt hours in 2020. Out of the clean energy sources, I noticed that wind and solar energy had the lowest electricity generation, and I wonder if this is because they are not as reliable sources as something like nuclear energy since they depend on the weather. Additionally, I noticed that coal had the lowest world electricity generation out of both fossil fuels and all types of fuels, approximating 8 million gigawatt hours around the year 2020. I wonder if it had such low gigawatt hours compared to other sources because it has become less and less popular over the years due to its harmful environmental risks. This relates to my community because I have noticed a greater implementation of clean, renewable energy sources as climate change has become a greater issue. My headline for this graph would be: “The Future of Clean Energy Awaits”.",
