  "raw_comment": "The first thing I noticed was that the United States' energy usage was only about twice as less as China's usage despite having a population less than a quarter the size of China's. This means that the average energy usage per person in the US is significantly greater than China's and especially India's. I then noticed the change in the type of energy the United States' has used over the years. From 2000 to 2020 there seems to be a decrease in coal, an small but noticeable increase in wind and solar, and then an increase in oil. So while the increased use of the clean wind and solar energy, and the decrease of coal energy looks good, I wonder if it is offset by the dramatic increase in oil. \nAs the graph depicts energy usage from 2000 to 2020, I am able to observe if me and my family's energy usage coorelates with the graph. Over the last 20 years many families in my neighborhood, including my own, added solar panels to their roofs, this lines up fairly accurately with when solar and wind power starts to increase (around 2010). I am glad to see this change, however I unfortunately also observe that with the layout of my suburban town, driving is almost essential to go to places so seeing an increase in oil also makes sense. These graphs should encourage people to cut out oil, if they need to go somewhere close and walking/biking is a feasible means of travel then they should consider that instead.
