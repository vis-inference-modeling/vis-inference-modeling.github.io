  "raw_comment": "As expected with new technology all over, world electricity generation has steadily increased over the last 20+ years. With this increase, fossil fuels have of course increased as well, but at an encouragingly slower rate. Worldwide, renewable energy sources have have begun to take up a large proportion of the electricity generation. The country-specific plots show some interesting trends. I wonder why the electricity generation in the United States has been mostly flat for two decades, even after all of the 21st century economic development. In my community, I hear about renewable energy all the time through campaigns, and it is encouraging to see in these graphs that the rate of increasing fossil fuels has slowed down dramatically, especially in the U.S. This personally affects me and everyone in my community because renewable energy reduces air pollution, leading better overall health.
