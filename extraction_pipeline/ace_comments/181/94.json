  "raw_comment": "In this graph, I notice that there is an overall increase in the trend of world electricity generation, when looking at all sources of electricity. In differentiating between clean sources and fossil fuels, clean sources seem to be much more prevalent in use than fossil fuels, which is a positive consequence. Diving even further into detail, I noticed that the United States has a much more gradual increase in electricity generation than that of China, which has a much steeper slope and more rapid increase in electricity generation.\nI wonder why exactly China's electricity generation has increased so much faster than that of the United States. Both China and the United States are massive centers of economic and industrial growth, so it is interesting that China's change in electricity generation is far more drastic than the United States.\nEnergy sources have a huge impact on me and my surrounding community. It is highly important that we steer away from using fossil fuels as an energy source, as they are detrimental to the environment and the world that we live in, and create more sources of clean energy. The United States' electricity generation increasing at a much slower rate is both good and bad for my community- good in the sense that less fossil fuels are being used, bad in the sense that less clean energy is used. I would title this graph \"Fueling the Future- World Electricity Generation from 2000 to 2020\".",
