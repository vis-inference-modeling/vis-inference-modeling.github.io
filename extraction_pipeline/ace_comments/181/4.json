  "raw_comment": "Overall, electricity generation has increased over time. While the use of clean energy sources globally has grown over the last 20 years, the use of fossil fuels has been consistently higher. Coal and gas are the most popular sources, and wind/solar power has experienced the most growth recently. \n\nI wonder why, even with the proliferation of new ways to generate electricity, the use of gas and coal has steadily increased. It must have something to do with the accessibility of the resources, but I wonder how much the growth of global population effects how electricity is generated. I wonder how greatly these statistics vary from country to country. \n\nCanvassing for the local democratic campaign, I noticed that clean energy was a very important issue. Everyone is impacted by the negative effects brought about by climate change, which the expenditure of fossil fuels has been proven to greatly contribute to global warming. \n\nGood Ole’ Coal: It’s Electric!",
