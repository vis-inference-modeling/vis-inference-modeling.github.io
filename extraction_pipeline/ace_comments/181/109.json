This is evident due to the nuclear, hydroelectric, and other, wind and solar increasing each by about a little over 10 million. \n2) What do you wonder?\nI wonder how this graph was created and what sampling method was used to receive the answers to support this data. \n3) How does this relate to you and your community?\nThe whole world requires all the generations evident in the graph and my community can receive a better understanding of the increase of these generations. This could help bring awareness of the fossil generations that may need to be lessened and communities can gather to help. \n4) What’s going on in this graph?\nElectricity Generations Increasing by Millions Each Year",
