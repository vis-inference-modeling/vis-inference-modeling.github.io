  "raw_comment": "1. I notice that the electricity generation has been increasing over time. As well as coal being the major generator which could negatively affect our environment but there is also an increase in clean generators. Also I could notice how China produces more electricity than the U.S by double and India by 5+ times.\n\n2.  I wonder what will happen over time and if the generators of electricity will be fossil or instead clean as time goes on. Also what is the reason for the difference in electricity generation for each country.\n\n3. This relates to me and my community because many people consider putting up solar panels in their houses and by doing so my town could really benefit as it seems that in the U.S a major part of the electricity produced is from coal or oil and it looks that slowly the U.S is using more clean ways to gather electricity.\n\n4.
