  "raw_comment": "The biggest thing that stands out to me from the four graphs is the increasing usage of coal power in China. In recent years, there's been a large global push towards clean energy in response to severe climate change, but these global trends don't appear whatsoever in China. In fact, the total coal usage from China is more than the total energy usage in the US. This makes sense from a population stand point, but looking at the graphs with that perspective makes me wonder why India's total energy usage is so low compared to China and the US, especially when the population of India is about the same as the population of China, which is much larger than the US. These graphs also make me wonder about how effective global initiatives can really be if there are still large nations not meeting the regulations designed to help clean our planet.\nUnderstanding how our nation produces the energy that we've grown to rely on helps contextualize issues regarding our energy grid. Ideas of severely reducing one form of energy versus another need to be backed by the knowledge of how we are currently relying on that energy. Simply making decisions or forming ideas without knowledge of the implications will lead to ignorant and damaging decisions.\nFor a title of the graphs, you could use \n\"What Powers the People? Energy Production Across the Years\"",
