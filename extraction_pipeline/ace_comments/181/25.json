  "raw_comment": "1.I notice up to 15 million gigawatt hours, takes up from fossil fuel, with majority being coal and gas, while little being oil. Clean gigawatts start from 10 to 30 million gigawatt hours, with most being taken up from Nuclear and Hydroelectric energy, with little being from wind turbines. \n\n2.I wonder how the graph will be affected in the future, will there be more fossil fuel or clean energy generation? I also wonder how both types of energy deeply affect our atmosphere and our ecosystem. \n\n3.This relates to my community as where I live, there are many factories letting out smoke (fossil fuel) which damages the Earth and my community, as my town needs more clean energy. \n\n4.Clean vs. Fossil electric generation, and it's effects",
