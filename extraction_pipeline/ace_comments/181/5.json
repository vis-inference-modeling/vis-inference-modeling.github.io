  "raw_comment": "Something that I noticed is that there is a graph that has a y-axis that is counted in gigawatt hours and an x-axis that is labeled in years. Additionally, there are tiered color blocks on the graph that each symbolize a different fuel for electricity. Another point is that the yellow-orange colored blocks are made of a cleaner fuel alternative and the black-gray blacks represent fossil fuel-based electricity options. Something that I wonder is how much a gigawatt is and what the best thing to compare it to would be in order to comprehend the size of it better. Another thing I wonder is what some of the differences between clean and fossil-based electricity are. This data affects the community around me because fossil fuels are a large contributor to climate change so it is important to see how much energy we are basing on fossil fuels versus cleaner fuel options. One headline for this graph could be, “Global Use and Differences in the Electricity Generation”",
