  "raw_comment": "This graph depicts the proportion of how different energy sources are used. Coal and gas are used most, but are also fossil fuels. The learner enemies of Nuclear, hydroelectric, and wind/solar are used far less. I wonder how the unclean sources are still the majority when climate change and environmental health have been such prevalent topics of conversation for years. While it was expected that fossil fuels would still be used more, It is surprising that they still dominate as the main sources of energy. There has been a large upsurge in the interests of the environment, hence the amount of energy produced by clean materials should be rising as years pass. This relates to every community because the health of the planet is the most important thing in preserving the health of the people. We need to care for our environment because it is our only home. It is my hope that change continues to push the use of fossil fuels down. A possible title is “Clean v Fossil; Who’s in Charge?”",
