  "raw_comment": "I noticed that the generation of electricity is increasing over the years as the world is changing. Additionally, more clean energy is being used as the world changes rather than using fossil fuels. Looking at the three smaller graphs, I notice that each graph contains vastly different amounts of energy use. For reference, India has the least usage while China uses the most.  I wonder why they change what energy is used throughout the years. I also wonder about ways we can lessen the energy consumption to have a decrease in statistics. Lastly I think about the last 3 graphs and how we can even achieve those rates. Even how those rates came to be would be beneficial to analyze a deeper look into how electricity is generated.\nThis relates to me and my community because we all generate electricity and this in turn consumes energy. This is not to say that energy should not be used at all, but especially fossil fuels can be harmful. In order to do this, there would need to be some sort of intervention. If my community does not begin to reduce their energy consumption, the world will not change for the better. I do not think that it is a matter of one energy being better than another, it has been made common sense that clean energy is, but overall reducing our usage will better support the earth than replacing energy sources. It is a start, but there still can be improvements made.\n\nNew Global Data on how Electricity is Generated- How will it affect our kids in the future?",
