I also notice that oil and other sources as well as nuclear and hydroelectric energy continue to stay at a steady rate and have not become more or less of a part of the world's electricity. Despite these steady rates, it appears that wind and solar power have drastically increased since 2010. I wonder if the use of wind and solar power will continue to increase as we become more conscious of the negative effects fossil fuels have on our environment and global warming. I also wonder if the use of nuclear and hydro sources of power will increase as they appear to have remained at a steady rate despite our advancements.",
