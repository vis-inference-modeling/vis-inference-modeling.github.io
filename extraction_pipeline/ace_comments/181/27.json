  "raw_comment": "I notice that there is more clean energy being used as time goes on, also that the gap between fossil fuels and clean energy continues to grow greater. I noticed that China has significantly higher numbers than The U.S. and India. I wonder why China's numbers continue to skyrocket while the U.S. stays the same or even drops in fossil fuels. I also wonder why Inda's numbers are so consistently low. This relates to me and my community because the use of fossil fuels and clean energy affects the environment around us. Using clean energy can help save our environment as global warming has become a big concern in the U.S., and this is why we can see the number of fossil fuels drop in the U.S..\n\"We Got Energy!\"",
