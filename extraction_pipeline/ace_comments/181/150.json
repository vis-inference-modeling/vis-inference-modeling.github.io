I wonder whether the trend toward cleaner energy sources will continue at this rate or whether there will be changes in the near future. This impacts my community since a change to cleaner power sources would benefit the environment. However, it depends whether we would be able to maintain it in a way that is sustainable. Otherwise we would struggle as a result. A catchy or fitting headline would be “The progress in Energy around the world”",
