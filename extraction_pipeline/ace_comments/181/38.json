  "raw_comment": "What I notice is how coal has generated the most amount of gigawatt hours, which is the worst for the environment, and  oil has generated the least amount of hours. Additionally, China uses some of the most electricity in the world, especially with coal , and it keeps increasing, whereas American has stayed pretty steady. What I wonder is why wind, solar, oil, and others are used less the nuclear or hydroelectric.  What's going on in this graph is it is trying to show people how the clean and fossil fuel energy is being used around the world and how many hours are being put in for each type of energy. This effects my community because we want more clean electricity generation being used rather then fossil fuels because it is better for the environment and more hours of that electricity is better., rather then how coal is being used right now. Catchy headline: The World's electricity generation: The results will really SHOCK you",
