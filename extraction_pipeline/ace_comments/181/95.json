  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\n-Over the years, China had the steepest increase in electricity generation, for all types of power, compared to the United States and India. \n- In 2000, China had lower amounts of electricity generation than the US but surpassed the US by around 2010. \n- The overall electricity generation in the US has not increased by much over the years, but there is a larger proportion of clean fuels being used instead of fossil fuels (especially coal).\n- India’s electricity generation remained lower than both China and the US but has steadily increased over the years. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\n- I wonder if the increase in electricity generation in China is correlated with how “open” their economy was. I know that China has worked on expanding its private sector. \n- I wonder why US electricity generation has plateaued, and if this phenomenon is also seen in other Western developed countries. \n- What is the relationship between energy generation and the political stability of a country?\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\n- This relates to how I might think/vote about certain energy policies in the US. \n- I see a lot more Teslas in the Bay Area - electric cars don’t seem like they are reserved for the rich anymore; many middle-class folks are buying Teslas to account for rising gas prices.\n\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\nOur Energy Usage Has Transformed Over the Last 20 Years",
