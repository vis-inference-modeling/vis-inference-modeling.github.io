  "raw_comment": "The first thing that I notice is that there is an increase in world electricity generated between 200 and 2022. I also see that the clean sources of energy have reliably produced more energy than the fossil fuel sources of energy. Not only that, but the clean sources seemed to have had a gain of over 10 million gigawatt hours, compared to fossil that has at most had 7 to 8 million gigawatt hours gain. From the second figure, we can see that Chinas total electricity has dramatically increased, where the amount generated has gone from about 1 million gigawatt hours to about 5.5 million for fossil and 7 to 8 million for clean.\nThis is significantly higher than the other two countries shown: the United States and India. Over the last 20 years, clean fuel has seemed to stay fairly steady in the US. whereas fossil fuel has seemed to decrease. This makes me wonder how population affects the need of fossil fuels compared to clean power. We know that the population of China is significantly larger than the US, so would this be the reason why China's electricity generation has increased so much? If so, why has the US electricity generation increased so little? This relates to my community because we are the new generation. Clean energy is the future and it is our lob and duty to take care of the planet. A catchy headline may be \"Are Fossil Fuels a Thing of the Past? - Clean vs Fossil Energy Production from 2000 to 2022\"",
