  "raw_comment": "In the world graph I noticed that fossil fuels remain as the source that generates the most amount of electricity from 2000-2020. The electricity generation has increased slightly for gas and coal. However, the electricity generation remained generally the same for nuclear energy at about 2 million gigawatt hours and hydroelectric sources at producing about 5 million gigawatt hours. Oil and other sources have remained constant as well at around 1 million gigawatt hours. I also noticed that the generation of electricity for wind and solar has greatly increased. From 2000-2o10 wind and solar were barely used to produce electricity, but there has been a steady rise to about 4 million gigawatt hours in 2020. Furthermore, for the country totals graphs, I noticed that the use of coal has increased in China and India, but has decreased in the United States. I wonder how the data will change once countries start to come closer to their climate change goals (will there truly be an increase in generation of electricity from clean energy than with fossil fuels?) I wonder what the data would be prior to 2000? Why is the United States more steady in electricity generation from 2000-2020 in comparison to China and India? This relates to my community because whether the United States generates electricity with clean power or fossil fuels will impact the economy and economic development. \n\n“Shocking News: Coal Remains as the Top Producer of Energy in the World”",
