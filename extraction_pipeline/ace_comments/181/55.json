  "raw_comment": "In this graph I notice how China has had the biggest incline of both clean power and fossil fuels. China has jumped from under 2 million to over 8 million gigawatt hours in 20 years. The United States has stayed relatively the same with 4 million gigawatt hours in a span of 20 years. India on the other hand has had the smallest increase, but still less than the United States. India has grown more in fossil fuels than clean power, with a growth of 2 million in the past 20 years. This to me is a bit surprising because India's population is greater than both the United States and China. Compared to China, India has over 16.4 million more than the population of China and their use of power is significantly less.  This might relate to my community because there should probably be more of an increase of the use of clean power, but it also shows the slight decrease of fossil fuels so that is comforting for the upcoming years.",
