Utilities are still using fossil fuels way more than clean energy - 3x times more! - to create our electricity.\n\nWhat I wonder: How will we ever save life on this planet with humanity’s addiction to a lifestyle that is not sustainable, electric utilities and the fossil fuel industry focused on amassing wealth and power, and government afraid to make the needed moves to regulate the solution.\n\nHow it will affect my community: Quality of life will fall slowly and then quickly for all my neighbors and me, and existential despair will be rampant.\n\nCatchy headline: Humanity’s Energy Use: Way Too Much, Way Too Dirty - What’s the Fix?",
