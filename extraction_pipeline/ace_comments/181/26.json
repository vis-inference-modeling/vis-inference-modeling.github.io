  "raw_comment": "In the four graphs, I notice that China’s graph is pretty high compared to India and the U.S. The other thing I recognized was how low the graph was for India, considering that the population of India is pretty high. The graph is so low, so that came as a surprise to see. The other thing I noticed was how leveled out the U.S. was in the graph, which was also surprising because even though our population is not as high as India's and China's, we use a lot of those products. I wonder why India's graph is so low for the number of people who live there. I also wonder why China uses much more than India, even though India has a high population. If I were to pick a catchy headline for the graphs, it would be, “The Big Three: Clean and Fossil Fuel.”",
