  "raw_comment": "I notice that according to the graph clean electricity generation is the most used for electrical generation. These electric generators have been leading since the graphs origin point which started in the year 2000. In comparison natural fossil fuels like coal and gas are on the low end of generation being the two lowest used forms of electricity generation in the world. I wonder about the history behind this graph? Can the growth of the types of electrical generation on this graph be put in a linear model or was there some point in time that coal and gas were leading electrical generation? This relates to my community because as I grow older technology is becoming more and more engraved in human life, which means more and more electricity is being taken in. High use of clean electrical generation can in turn help save the environment rather than its fossil fuel counterpart which has some negative side effects.\n\nIs The Worlds Electricity is Clean or Dirty",
