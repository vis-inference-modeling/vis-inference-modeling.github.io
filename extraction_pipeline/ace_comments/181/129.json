  "raw_comment": "Over the past two decades, global electricity generation has experienced a steady rise, driven by advancements in technology. Examining country-specific data reveals intriguing patterns in developed countries such as the United States, but also in third world countries such as India. I wonder why the United States' electricity generation has been largely stagnant compared to that of China.  This especially intrigues me given the United States' drastic economic development throughout the 21st century. This relates to my community because the transition to renewable energy carries significant benefits, notably in reducing air pollution and enhancing overall health for so many individuals alike.
