  "raw_comment": "I notice that, depending on the countries, there is a different type of relationship between the year and the amount of electricity that is being generated by each of them. For example, China exhibits a strong and fast linear growth between the years 2000 and 2020, whereas India’s is more gradual and the United State’s seems to be staying relatively the same. However, overall all countries seem to be using more clean sources, such as nuclear, than they do fossil. This makes me wonder whether the world is truly getting ‘cleaner’ or if these countries are slowly straying away from using fossil fuels to generate electricity. This is very relevant to me and my community in that nuclear enegery, hydroelectric energy, and other clean energies do not produce air pollution as some fossil fuels are notorious for. In order for my community and I to live safer and healthier lives, these are things to consider. Headline: ‘The Race Between Clean Energy and Fossil Fuels Continues’.",
