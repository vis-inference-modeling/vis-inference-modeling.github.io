  "raw_comment": "I've noticed that oil has produced the fewest gigawatt hours and coal has produced the most, with coal being the least environmentally friendly. In addition, since 2000, the amount of electricity generated worldwide has increased, with a rise from 5 to 15 million GWH in the use of clean energy.China consumes a significant amount of electricity globally, mostly from coal, and this consumption is still growing, while US electricity consumption has been relatively stable. I wonder why do the US and China have such differing overall energy usage? Why is the US's production staying steady over the past 20 years while China's is increasing so quickly? I also wonder how much more expensive it is to produce electricity from clean sources compared to fossil fuels?This affects my community because it would be better for everyone  if we continue to use clean energy sources over fossil fuels. In addition, clean energy sources are more sustainable and efficient than the current coal-based electricity system because they generate a greater quantity of electricity over a longer period of time.\n\nCatchy headline: Watt a Way to Save the Environment",
