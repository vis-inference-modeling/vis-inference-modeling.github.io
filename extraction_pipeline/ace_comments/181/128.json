  "raw_comment": "In these graphs I notice the increase of electrical generation and the positive correlation it has with years. I noticed that this increase isn’t necessarily equal amongst all countries as seen in the graphs of India, China, and the United States. China’s electrical production has grown at a high linear rate every year from 2000 to 2020, while the United States has only slightly grown over the 20 year time span. I also notice that each country’s main source of electrical generation is coal, but the United States has been decreasing coal use over time while the other two countries both have been increasing theirs. \n\nI wonder how the United States has been able to keep their electrical generation steady while growing in population and economically, but China’s has grown by almost four times. Of course China’s population is much greater but the large discrepancy in electrical generation is puzzling. This leads me to wonder if other countries outside the United States have environmental laws and acts put in place.\n\nI live in California and this relates to my community because we are constantly passing new laws to preserve the environment and eliminate the use of fossil fuels. I have lots of family in India, and that community is being affected by the fossil fuels being burned, changing the climate. Farmers in India have been forced to move from their hometowns because of climate change and resources have been scarce.\n\n“Electrical Generation: Why Nuclear is Good, For Once.”",
