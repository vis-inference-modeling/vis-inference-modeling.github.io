  "raw_comment": "When analyzing the graphs depicting total electricity generation in China, the United States, and India, China immediately captured my attention. This is because it displays a tremendous increase in electricity generated in a short amount of time (only about 20 years). This is vastly different from the graph of the United States, which reveals a relatively stable trend in electricity generated. India on the other hand, has the lowest amount of electricity generated, and not only that, but most of their electricity is generated from fossil fuels, instead of clean power sources. The initial graph displaying the global levels of electricity generation indicates that there has been a steady increase over time, accompanied by a noticeable shift towards increased utilization of clean energy sources.\nSomething I wonder is if China and India both have similar populations, why is China's electricity usage about 4 times larger than India's? I also wonder how the United States electricity usage has remained so consistent throughout the years, even though we have had many new inventions/resources that require an immense amount of power.\nThe fact that still over half of our electricity production is coming from fossil fuels, is a bit concerning due to the fact of their many harmful impacts on Earth. I know switching to cleaner forms of electricity can be more expensive, but they are overall better for our planet.\nTitle: \"Powering the World: Electricity Generation Over the Last 20 Years\"",
