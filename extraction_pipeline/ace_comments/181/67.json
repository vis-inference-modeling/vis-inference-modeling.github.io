  "raw_comment": "The first thing I notice about this graph is how much coal and gas contribute to the electricity generated between 2000 and 2022 overall. What I notice about China's graph in particular is that it's electricity production has been on the rise, along with its use of coal and gas. The United States' electricity production is the opposite; its electricity production slightly increased while its use of Coal has significantly decreased. India's electricity production, while on the rise, still relies overwhelmingly on coal, and produces less than a quarter of the electricity China produces, despite having similar populations. \nI wonder why China's use of hydroelectric makes up the majority of its clean energy, while nuclear makes up the majority of the United States' energy. I wonder if the difference is due to the country's philosophies regarding these two power sources, or if its due to the different geography of each country. \nThe increasing trend of emitting less carbon emissions relates to our community since a decrease in carbon emissions could slow down the effects of climate change. Although the world produces more electricity, the United States has seen a reduction in the use of coal, while China has seen an increase in clean energy production.\nTwo titles I suggest would be \"Electricity Production Stabilizes in the U.S.\", or \"Electricity Production on the Rise Around the Globe.\"",
