  "raw_comment": "This graph shows the World's Electricity Generation from 2000-2022, specifies where this energy is derived from, and if that energy is clean or fossil. I notice that there are more gigawatt hours of fossil electricity such as gas, oil, and coal than clean electricity. This is expected given the global warming crisis that we are currently facing as a result of these fossil fuels being emitted into the air in order to generate electricity. However, I also noticed that clean energy has significantly increased since 2000, especially wind and solar electricity which faced a significant increase. As climate change has become a more real and pressing issue over the past couple of years, there has been a bigger push to use renewable energy such as putting solar panels on your roof. The more specific graphs demonstrate electric generation in countries like China, India, and the U.S. I noticed that China used significantly more electricity than India even though they have the same population. China also generates most of its electricity through coal. This makes sense considering how industrialized China is and how many factories it needs to upkeep. I can infer this is why China has such bad air quality and pollution. The graph of the U.S. concerns me because while our population is much less than India's, we still use more electricity than them. I wonder what other innovations we will develop to limit fossil electricity generation.\n\"The Future is Clean!\"",
