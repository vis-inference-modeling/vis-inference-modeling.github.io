  "raw_comment": "1. I noticed the graph's overall increasing tendency, as well as the significant increase in energy consumption since 2000. Yet, clean energy has accounted for the vast majority of this energy increase, while coal, gas, and oil have remained relatively stable over the last two decades.\n2. I'm curious why China has had such a significant rise in electricity compared to the United States and India. I also wonder what will motivate the entire world to utilize more clean energy than fossil fuels to create electricity.\n3. This concerns me and my community because as the world transitions to more clean and renewable energy sources, the pollution from fossil fuels is expected to reduce, which is good for the earth and will benefit all of us. \n4. Changes in Electricity Generation: Is it Changing for the Better?",
