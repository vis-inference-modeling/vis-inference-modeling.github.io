  "raw_comment": "I  notice that over time the electricity in the world has increased in both the clean energy areas and the fossil fuels areas. I wonder why India generates less electricity than the US even though they have a bigger population. This can relate to my community because I live in the US and it makes me curious to see how much clean energy and fossil fuels my country uses in comparison to others. A catchy headline would be: \"On the road to cleaner energy?\"",
