  "raw_comment": "The first thing that I noticed was that the United States' energy usage was about half of China's despite the United States having a population less than a fourth of China's population. This means that per person, we use more than twice the amount of energy than China does. This only true for the most recent years too, as in earlier parts of the graph our energy usage per person is even greater compared to China's.\nAnother thing I noticed was how the type of energy the United States uses changed. We can see a gradual increase in both oil and wind and solar starting around 2010, with a decrease in coal around that same time. While it is good that  the United States is using more wind/solar energy and using less coal energy, I wonder if that will be offset by the increased usage in oil. These shifts in the graph are something that I can connect back to own community. My hometown is a suburban area in California, where over the past 10 years I have observed many households add solar panels to their houses, including my own. So that increase in the graph I can definitely reflect. However, on the other hand, the suburban landscape also dictates the necessitiy for a car, which increases the use of oil. So that is something in the graph that I can also unfortunately reflect in my hometown. What this graph should tell us is that we should limit our oil use, whether it's walking to places or using public transit. A title would be \"3 largest countries in the world, how they use energy\"",
