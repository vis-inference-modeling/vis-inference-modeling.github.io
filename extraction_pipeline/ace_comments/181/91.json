  "raw_comment": "Compared to the US and India, I've seen that China's rise in power generation has been far greater. Globally, there has been a consistent rise in the production of energy, with wind and solar power growing in importance since 2010. \n\nI find it hard to understand why there has been a rise in the use of fossil fuels when there are so many businesses fighting to reduce the use of these fuels and campaigners pushing for the switch to renewable energy.\n\nThis has an effect since it raises awareness among my community and myself about the source of our electricity and may encourage lobbying for a greater emphasis on the generation of clean energy.\n\nHow Is the Global Electricity Supply Changing?",
