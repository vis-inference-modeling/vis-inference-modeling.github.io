  "raw_comment": "In these four graphs presented to us I notice the differences in exports and imports of Electricity generation. Notice how each Nuclear energy is at the top of each graph and coal is at the least amount. I wonder if these countries partnered up, would the exports and imports double to produce for both countries, or would it decrease due to the fact of it being harder to produce and keep stable for two countries. Well I live in the United States so this tells me were only making enough in my country just to get by for 330 million people, this also tells me our environment is being harmed in the process of creating these oils. My headline would be: Differences in Countries' Electricity.",
