  "raw_comment": "We evaluated a 2022 graph titled “World electricity generation” by Ember. We noticed that it displayed the types and amounts of energy used throughout the world as a whole from 2000 to the 2020s. There were also separate graphs that specifically documented the energy usage of the United States, China, and India over the same time period. We noted that the overall energy usage worldwide for all types is going up, and that nuclear is the most prominent energy source while coal is the least prominent. We also noticed that there were “dips” in worldwide energy usage around 2008 and 2020, which probably correspond with the economic hardships caused by the 2008 housing crisis and the coronavirus pandemic. \n\n \n\nWe wonder what the data looked like before 2000, as “clean” energy seems to be a relatively new phenomenon. We also wonder why India’s energy usage is so low when compared to the United States and China.\n\n \n\nThis topic is important because we all use energy every day, and it is useful to know the main types of energy being used. It also gives more insight into how different countries operate.\n\n \n\nOur title for the graph is “Ember’s Evaluation of the Evolution of Electricity.”",
