  "raw_comment": "What do you notice about how electricity generation around the world is changing? What do you wonder? \nOver the past 20 years the electricity has increased. I wonder if any of these resources will ever run out and we won’t have any resources to rely on anymore. Nuclear energy has always been high but it has climaxed.  Coal has been steady throughout the past 20 years though. In the 4charts it seems that China uses the most energy and surprisingly Chins uses more energy than the United states. I already know that India is going to have the lowest in resources because they have to reserve theirs because it is limited.",
