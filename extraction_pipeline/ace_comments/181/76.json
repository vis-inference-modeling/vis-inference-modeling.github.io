  "raw_comment": "I noticed how dips in energy production (2008 and 2020) seem to follow years with an economic recession. Additionally, nuclear energy seems to generate the most electricity but the differences between each type are not overwhelmingly different. I enjoyed the gradient with the energy type color coding. Thinking about the use of this graph in a broader sense, it could be tied to climate change. While there is an upward trend within all the energy sources, sources colored “clean” have a more dramatic slope in their trend line.  This impacts me and my community because it provides hope for the future and suggests we are headed in a good direction to work on taking better care of our planet. A catchy title for this graph would be Ticking Towards a Cleaner Future: World Electricity Generation (2000-2024).",
