  "raw_comment": "Second comment:\n In the second set of graphs, I notice that China's use of clean sources of power has significantly increased whereas the U.S.'s use of clean power sources has remained relatively the same over the past twenty years. I also noticed that India uses incredibly less power than both the U.S. and China. I wonder why India uses such little power and why China uses so much power even though their populations are both 1.4 billion. I wonder why the U.S. uses more power than India although their population is so much larger than that of the U.S. This relates to myself and my community as the fate of our environment is dependent on the U.S.'s choice to either pursue using cleaner sources of power in the future or to continue to rely so heavily upon fossil fuels.\n\nEnergy & the Environment:",
