  "raw_comment": "I noticed that out of China, the United States, and India, China appears to use the most clean energy but all of them mainly use fossil fuels. I wonder what will be the breaking point to cause more places to switch to clean energy. I know that places are trying to switch to just clean energy, but the cost of it can be expensive. This impacts my community because if the U.S. starts to run out of fossil fuels or is unable to purchase fossil fuels from other countries, people may start to struggle to afford using clean energy all the time. A  catchy headline would be \"The future towards clean energy.\"",
