  "raw_comment": "The four graphs shown depict energy and electricity use in China, the United States, India, and the worldwide average. The first thing I found interesting about this graph was that the majority of energy being used comes from fossil fuels, which are extremely harmful to the environment. It's also extremely interesting to me how India has such a large population but uses very little energy compared to China and the U.S, and I wonder why that is. India also has continued to use mainly fossil fuels for energy, while China and the U.S seem to be using more renewable resources as time goes on. Out of the three counties, the U.S seems to be the only one cutting back on unsustainable resources like gas and oil. I wonder why other countries continue to use so much fossil fuels to fuel their energy system although its harm to the environment is widely known.",
