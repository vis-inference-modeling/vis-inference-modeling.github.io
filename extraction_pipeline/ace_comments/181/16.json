  "raw_comment": "The world's electricity generation has been steadily climbing for the past 25 years, with a particular increase in clean energy. China produces the more energy than the US, with India producing less than both.\nI wonder why India produces so much less energy than China despite the vast population living in both countries. Maybe China is more urbanized and industrialized than India. I also find it interesting that the United States has a small amount of people compared to both China and India, yet produces so much energy.\nAs someone who lives on Earth during the current climate crisis, it is somewhat relieving to see the amount of clean energy being produced. This data gives me some comfort that people are working together to find new ways to mobilize society in a safe and clean way.\nHeadline: RISE AND SHINE, WORLD",
