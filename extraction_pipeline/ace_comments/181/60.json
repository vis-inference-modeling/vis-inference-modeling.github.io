  "raw_comment": "I notice that even though India has roughly four times the population compared to the United States, its electricity generation is less than half. Also, China and India have roughly the same number of citizens, yet China's electricity generation is more than four times India's. I also notice that nuclear power usage has almost doubled over the past 24 years. This makes me wonder why such large countries vary so much in their need for electricity. I also wonder if, or when, India will hop on the boat of using cleaner power. Lastly, I wonder what is seen as a \"good\" amount of electricity generation. Is China doing too much? Is India doing too little? Where does the U.S. fall into the mix? This doesn't necessarily relate to me and my community other than showing how much electricity my country uses. A headline that could describe this graph could be, \"The Modern 'Goldilocks.' How Much is Too Much?\"",
