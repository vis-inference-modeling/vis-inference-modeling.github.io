  "raw_comment": "Its shocking to see that the US has such a low energy usage increase, especially with how much energy is used now in days I would've expected it to be much higher. \n\nI wonder what factors play into the fact that India's energy usage is so low compared to China and the united states', I would expect it to be lower compared to those two but that low?\n\nThis relates to my community and to my own house specifically because we use so much energy everyday in my house, we can't function without it and looking at the united states' together its like wow, its not as high as I thought, I wonder what increases chinas usage of energy so much.\n\n\"Which country uses the most energy?\"",
