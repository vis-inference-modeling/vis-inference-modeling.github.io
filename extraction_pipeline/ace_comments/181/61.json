However, as coal, gas, and oil have essentially stagnated over the past 20 years, the majority of this energy growth is coming from renewable energy.\n2-It is surprising to me that China and the US produce more electricity than India considering that both countries have about the same population. How do they provide over a billion people in their population with electricity?\n3-This worries me and my neighborhood because it is anticipated that pollution from fossil fuels will decline as the globe switches to more renewable and clean energy sources, which is helpful for the environment and will help all living things. \n4-Energizing the Future: Re-purposing Our Energy",
