  "raw_comment": "I notice that world electricity generation has increased since 2000, and that clean energy has become more prevalent (rising from 5 to 15 million GWh). I also notice that China had a dramatic increase in electricity use, though the use of coal (a fossil fuel) is the predominant source of power. In contrast, the United States has used less coal since 2000 (2 to 0.4 million GWh). India has generated far less electricity than China or the US--- only around 2 million GWh in 2020.\n\nI wonder why world electricity generation has become increasingly clean. Is it due to international legislation, or because the cleaner resources have become cheaper? I also wonder if the electricity generation in China is increasing because they are a developing nation. I am very surprised that India has such low electricity generation being such a large nation, but I am curious if China's graph was similar prior to 2000.\n\nThis relates to me and my community because electricity generation will either pollute or conserve the environment. Fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal spur environmental degradation. Therefore, it is important that world electricity generation becomes increasingly clean so that increased worldwide development does not make climate change worse.\n\n\"CURRENT News: World Electricity Generation Changes\"",
