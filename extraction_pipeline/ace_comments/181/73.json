  "raw_comment": "I noticed a general upward trend in electricity generation with China having the greatest rate of change, and the US staying somewhat constant. It also seems that for all countries, cleaner energy is dominant. \n\n I wonder why the US has not seen a significant shift in electricity generation. I also wonder why China has seen a significant upward shift in Electricity generation. I also wonder why the US is the only country that has seen a decrease in coal electricity production. Additionally, I wonder what other countries graphs look like.\n\nThis relates to me and the community as the US is on a trend to eliminate non-clean electricity generation. When I'm older, It is likely that the US will phase out non-clean electricity generation. However, I wonder if the constant trend indicates that the US economy is not growing as fast. \n \nA title could be \"Electricity generation of 2000s: A path toward cleaner energy\"",
