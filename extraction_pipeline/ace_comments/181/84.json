  "raw_comment": "I noticed that the graph's general increasing trend and the significant increase in energy consumption starting in 2000. China's growth in electricity generation over time has been the steepest when compared to India and the US. In general, the bulk of this energy growth is coming from clean energy, since coal, gas, and oil have essentially stagnated over the past 20 years. \nI wonder what factors caused China to have a big increase in electricity generated compared to the US and India.\nThis relates because I use a lot of electricity and gas. Also, now awareness can be raised so that it is detectable how renewable energy sources can generate more electricity. \nCountry Power and Energy!",
