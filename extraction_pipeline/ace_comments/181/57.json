  "raw_comment": "I notice that every category is rapidly increasing over the years. The clean category also seems to be outweighing the fossil category. I also noticed in the other graphs that China has a significantly larger increase in the graph than the United states and India, which is significantly low. I wonder what they can do to end up with only clean power. I'm sure in the long run that would be the goal because it is so much better for our planet. I wonder what it would take to get there though because countries like China have such large amounts of fossil electricity. I think this can relate to money. Like in countries like China, some people have a lot of money and are very wealthy but misuse that money. China is granted large amounts of electricity but still uses a lot of unclean sources. This can be similar to people with a lot of money in our world today and choose not to spend it on anything useful or to help out other people. If I had to make a headline I would make it, “The unfair and uneven spread of resources around our world”.",
