  "raw_comment": "From looking at these 4 graphs, I am noticing that as the years increase, electricity generated from clean energy sources is increasing faster than electricity generated from fossil fuels. This makes sense due to new technology such as solar panels that has been introduced to produce cleaner energy in more recent years. I also wonder if the growing movement to protect the environment has had any effect, as more and more people are realizing how much these fossil fuels harm the planet. If the switch from fossil fuels to clean energy sources continues, this would have a very positive impact on our planet, as fossil fuels are big contributors to global issues such as global warming. I think that a catchy headline for this graph could be “Where does our Electricity really come from?”",
