  "raw_comment": "I noticed that India's energy consumption was the lowest over all years, while the US's was the largest until around ‘10 when it was passed by China. Additionally, clean power has increased in all countries, with wind and solar energy becoming more popular recently.\n\nI wonder why the United States' energy consumption has remained about the same despite the population becoming larger.\n\nThis allows me to see the energy I am likely consuming. It is difficult to know exactly where one's energy is coming from; however, this graph gives some context of the United States' and likely my own energy consumption.\n\nChange of type and amount of energy",
