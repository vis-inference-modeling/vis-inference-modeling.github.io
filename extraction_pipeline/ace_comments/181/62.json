Those resources being shown include nuclear, gas, coal, wind, solar, oil, hydroelectric, and others. The second graph shows how much of those resources are being used in various countries. Overall, the world has seen a steady increase in the use of the noted resources to power electricity.  Mostly so in nuclear power which was used around 15 million gigawatt hours in 2000 and jumped to surpassing 25 million gigawatt hours in 2020. Out of the country graphs, China is seen to have the biggest jump in use. Nuclear alone jumped over 8 million gigawatt hours in 20 years. India has the slowest incline while America has remained rather stagnant in the amount of resources and energy being produced since 2000. I wonder why America has not seen a drastic increase in the use of resources the way countries like China have. I wonder if there will be a noticeable increase in oil use with the Willow Project being pursued. This relates to my community because we are all affected by the different uses of electrical power. Both clean power and fossil fuels have their pros and cons for communities. For example, clean power is better for the environment but can be less efficient and more cost-effective. Not every community has the privilege of being able to use better, cleaner energy sources. \n\n“What Lights Up The World? Our Energy Sources Since the 2000s”",
