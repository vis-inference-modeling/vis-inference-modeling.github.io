  "raw_comment": "These graphs show the universal and individually national use of clean and fossil fuels. In the universal graph, I notice that there is a definite spike in the use of clean energy, which is probably due to growing environmental awareness and research. In the graph depicting China's energy use, it seems that although clean fuel is increasing, fossil fuels are too, and to a much larger extent, especially with the use of coal. The United States seems to be significantly improving on their use of fossil fuels. I notice that India uses very little energy at all. I wonder why this is, especially since India is an extremely large country with a large population. This relates to me and my community because if we don't start caring for our planet more, we will have a much dirtier and unhealthy world to live in and leave for future generations. I hope that government leaders everywhere understand the impact of using such detrimental fossil fuels and understand the benefit of using cleaner energy sources. \n\"Reaching a Cleaner Future: Energy Sources Around the World\"",
