  "raw_comment": "1.  The rate of wind and solar have been becoming higher since 2000, but fossil fuels occupies more than half of materials. In fact, the situation is seen as a problem, so the governments of various countries are promoting renewable energy. I had an opportunity to think about a solution to improve the situations when I was a junior high school student. \n2. I wonder why the electric power generation in the world decreased in around 2008 and 2021. I think that the Lehman shock in 2008 and the spreading of coronavirus relate to the result. Indeed, the economy was in a slump because of them, so demand of electric power generation decreased. \n3. If the rate of fossil fuels remains steady, the global warming and the air pollution will worsen. So, the precious natural environment in Akita, where I live, could be negatively affected. For instance, the growth of Akita cedars may deteriorate. \n4. Catchy headline : What is the Solution to Increase the Rate of Clean Energy?",
