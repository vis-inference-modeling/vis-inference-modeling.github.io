I also noticed that clean, renewable power tends to be used over fossil fuels.\n\n2) I wonder why China and the U.S. have more electrical generation than India when India has the same population as China. How are they supplying electricity to their over 1 billion population?\n\n3) As the world turns to more clean & renewable sources for electricity, the pollution of fossil fuels will likely decrease, which is beneficial to the planet we live in. In addition the overall increase in the world's total electrical generation reflects the rapid advancements in technology and other things that require electricity to power.\n\n4) Electric Boom",
