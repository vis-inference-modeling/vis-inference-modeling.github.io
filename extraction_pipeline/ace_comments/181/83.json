  "raw_comment": "1) I notice that overall electricity generation has increased over the years. It is seen that in all the graphs, there is more fossil-sourced generation than clean globally. Coal seems to be the main source, as it's the biggest category across all graphs. As the years pass cleaner sources are also increasing. When looking at particular countries, in China it is constantly growing, with the U.S. having a rather constant electricity generation and a rather slow increase in India. \n\n2) How do China's, the U.S.'s, and India's societies contrast each other considering their electricity generation?  May there be a decrease in fossil fuels and more clean power in years to come? \n\n3) As electricity generation only seems to generally increase, while fossil fuels seem to be the main sources, there are also cleaner options. As the years pass and more modern inventions are made, it is expected electricity generation will only increase, however cleaner and healthier methods shall be considered as they also affect the environment. The U.S. seems to be trying to make this change.\n\n4)  The Rise of Electricity Generation: Fossil vs Clean Energy",
