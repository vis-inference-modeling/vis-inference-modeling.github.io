  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\n\nLooking at the global scale, the production of electricity has been continuously increasing. This increase is also followed by the rise in the consumption of resources. Despite clean electricity sources having the ability to produce more electricity than fossil fuels, it seems that fossil fuels are more popular in terms of consumption. Coal, for instance, is the most consumed, but generates the least amount of electricity\n\nWind and solar energy began to receive more traction around 2010 and produces a significant amount of electricity.\n\nUnlike China and India, the fossil fuel consumption in the United States began to decrease around 2010.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\n\nWhy do China and India continue to consume fossil fuels?\n\nDespite having a smaller population, why does India produce less electricity and consume fewer resources than the United States?\n\nWhat does the steady trend in clean electricity production and the decrease in fossil fuel electricity production say about electricity production in the United States?\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\n\nThis is relevant to me and my community because we can see how much renewable energy sources can generate more electricity. Knowing how much fossil fuels cause pollution, I wonder how much I contribute to the consumption of these resources and how my community and I can avoid it.\n\nCatchy Headline:\n\n\"Clean Energy: More Power, Less Consumption - But why?\"",
