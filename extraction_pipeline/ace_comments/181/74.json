  "raw_comment": "Switching fully to clean energy is crucial to mitigating environmental damage. The 'World Electricity Generation' graph shows energy trends over 20+ years, revealing a concerning global reliance on coal and gas, despite advances in renewable energy technology. It's alarming that, globally, these non-renewables dominate, even as the US shifts from coal to natural gas—ironic, given America's role in clean energy innovation. This data prompts questions about the fossil fuel industry's influence in maintaining this imbalance, despite its known environmental costs. I hope that eye-opening statistics like this help influence my local policymakers to make better, more environmentally conscious decisions regarding the continued use of fossil fuels. My personal suggested headline for this graph is, “Capturing the Disproportionality Between Renewable and Fossil Fuel Energy Sources - 2000 to 2022.”",
