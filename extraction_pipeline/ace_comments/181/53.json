  "raw_comment": "This graph charts the source of the world’s electricity supply based on the method of its production--that is, whether the electricity was produced via fossil fuel consumption in the form of oil, gas, and coal; or, if clean sources like hydroelectric, wind, solar, and nuclear power were used in production. The lion’s share of global power production, as the graph indicates, originates in the burning of coal, and, more broadly, other fossil fuels. This is despite an evident recent uptick in reliance on clean energy sources, perhaps spurred on by recent ecocentric movements and such measures as the Paris Accords. Indeed, the pressures to which such a move responds seem pressing, so much so that the global predominance of coal energy sources--which produce the greatest amount of and therefore most harmful greenhouse emissions--incites no little concern. This concerning trend finds further grounding in the subsequent graphs included below, wherein the global energy consumption is broken apart into a few constituent countries’. The graph evinces that China, one of the world’s foremost economic and industrial superpowers, remains largely dependent on coal energy for its massive energy consumption, around twice that of the United States. The unfortunate truth of such statistics is that overreliance on coal does not only affect the country producing it, but has devastating environmental ramifications for the entire world.",
