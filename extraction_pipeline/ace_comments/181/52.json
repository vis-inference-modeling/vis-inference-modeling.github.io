  "raw_comment": "In the graph, the three countries presented are the three most populated in the world. China and the U.S. produce the most energy, while China and India have the greatest demand for it. I also noticed that China and India rely most heavily on energy produced by coal, while the U.S. is primarily oil and nuclear. I wondered why that is. I presume it is because coal is cheap so it is more affordable for China and India to produce energy for such large populations. An additional thought comes to my mind as well. Why does the U.S. go almost fully nuclear, and build more nuclear plants around the country. It is currently the largest energy producer while also being the cleanest. China, for example, has begun construction of 22 power plants, so why don't we construct more? With the overall cost of living increasing everywhere, it would be more beneficial for the U.S. to construct more nuclear power plants to provide cheaper electricity.",
