  "raw_comment": "I notice that clean energy has been taking up more and more of a fraction, but every single method of electricity has increased over the years, likely because of an increase of population and an increase of areas with electricity over the years.  I wonder if there's going to be a bigger shift towards clean energy in the future that will shift the ratios of energy usage.  This relates to my community because we use a lot of gas, but we also have wind farms and solar farms here as well.  A headline could be \"What Kind Of Energy Does The World Use?\"",
