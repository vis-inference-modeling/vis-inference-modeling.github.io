Indonesia has the highest population out of all the countries. Brazil and Mali are the lowest in each category. We wonder what makes younger people think more postively about the world and why the older generation thinks so negatively. Also, we wonder what the older people see as the negatives about the world and what the youngers see so postive. The impact we think affects us is because we, ourselves, are apart of the 15-24 year olds.",
