  "raw_comment": "What I find both interesting and predictable is that in most countries, there are more 15-24-year-olds than 40+-year-olds who think that the world is getting better with each generation. It took me a second to recognize, but the countries on the top left side of the line (positive residual) have higher percentages of younger adults than older adults who believe that the world is getting better, while on the bottom right (negative residual) show that the older adults think that the world is getting better more than, the younger adults. It makes sense that older people wouldn't believe that the world is improving since there are more progressive young adults and conservative older adults. This leads me to wonder, how would these statistics change as time continues to progress and younger adults become older adults? Since new concepts are built each generation, it makes sense that those older than the latest generation would have a hard time understanding how the world is changing and thus not want it to change. This is important to remember to ensure that the world truly continues to get better and that all generations can be excited and confident about those changes.",
