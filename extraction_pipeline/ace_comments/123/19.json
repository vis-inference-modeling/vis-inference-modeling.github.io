This is much more than the 40+ year old. \nI wonder why the younger generation thinks the world is getting better and the older generation doesn't. What do the younger generation think and see?\nThis relates to my community because some people in my community think it's getting better and some think it's not. \nA catchy headline- Good V.S. Bad",
