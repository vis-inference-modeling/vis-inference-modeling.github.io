  "raw_comment": "The graph compares the younger vs older generations faith in future generations to better the world.  I notice the younger group of people have a more positive outlook on the future of the world and the impact new generations have than the older generations. Infact, with the exception of India, Nigeria, and Moroco every group of younger people have more faith than their older counterparts. I wonder if this disparity in faith is simply old people being pessimistic, or if it is a result of an overconfident younger generation that lack the wisdom to realistically look into the future. This doesn’t really relate to my community, regardless of our faith in future generations both current generations young and old will strive to better the world, thus this comparison is no more than an insightful insight into our faith in the future.",
