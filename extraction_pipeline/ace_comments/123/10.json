  "raw_comment": "I notice that the younger groups are optimistic on how they view different generations. There's various countries with no similar political or economic agenda that have participated in this survey.\n\nI wonder why the older generations don't think the world is getting better ? What is causing them to believe that ? What cause the newer generation to have views of a better future and will the older generation and new ever see eye to eye ?\n\nThis relates to me and my community because there's adults in the community that think the younger generation is disruptive, uneducated and very ignorant but lots of the newer ones think they're making a big piracy because they know to speak up , attend protests and allow fort themselves to be heard.\n\nA title for this could be \"Same Age Once ; Difference in Views\"",
