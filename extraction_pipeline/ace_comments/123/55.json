  "raw_comment": "I’ve noticed on this graph that generally more people aged 15-24 believe the world is becoming better with each generation compared to people 40  years old believing the world is becoming better with new generations. This graph confuses me because it doesn’t really send a message or show a general trend for different country types, the only thing I really noticed was that there were more African and Asian countries that both had higher group percentages compared to European and South American countries. I’m curious as to why the author of this graph has chosen to only choose 21 countries and didn’t include a lot of age groups- because 15 year olds and 24 year olds are very very different people. It’s a very small data set too, with only 21,000 people taken in all of the countries. This graph relates to my community because there’s a stigma in my community and my country that more recent generations are “more lazy” than older generations, which might be the cause of the very low percentage of 40  year olds thinking the generations have been getting better. \n\nDoes geography change the different generation’s views on each other?",
