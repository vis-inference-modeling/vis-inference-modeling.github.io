  "raw_comment": "[2/5] Overall, the number of global and regional crises did not fall but rather got bigger after the Cold War ended in 1991 when a new world order originally endowed with hope was established. Adults who are aged more than 40 have had enough of these havocs, and they have been hoping that things will gradually settle down when the U.S.S.R. collapsed. However, the exact opposite has happened. The disappointment is huge, and so did the hope of having a nonviolent world drop. This should happen to be the answer to why adults aged more than 40 are generally more pessimistic about the current world than young adults aged between 15 to 24 in the poll. These young adults grew up in the best of times with pervasive high-end technologies and democracies, so they have no idea what the quadragenerians have lived through in their childhood and adolescence, which was an era dominated by political animosity between Western democracies and Eastern communist dictatorships, giving rise to a myriad of global conflicts. That explains why younger adults have generally more positive thoughts on the world’s status quo.",
