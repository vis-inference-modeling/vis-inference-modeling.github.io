  "raw_comment": "I noticed that a larger portion of the younger generation has more optimism than the older generation. I wonder why everyone in Indonesia is so optimistic while the people in Mali are the most pessimistic. This relates to my community because we are the next generation and our optimism could be the thing keeping us from giving up on the Earth. If we think that this is going nowhere, we won't try to save our planet. I think this graph is trying to show us that the younger generations are more prepared to deal with the turmoil we are enduring currently because they have more optimism. I'd call this graph Optimism V. Age",
