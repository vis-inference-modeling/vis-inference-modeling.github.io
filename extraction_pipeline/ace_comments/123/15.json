  "raw_comment": "I noticed that more people ages 15-24 said that the world is getting better with each generation whereas less people ages 40+ said that the world is getting better with each generation. Additionally, I noticed that there are many different countries with ranging economic, social and political statuses that participated in this survey.\n\nI wonder how much the graph would change if every country in the world was included. Has the economic status affected these results? What was the reason for Indonesia and Mali having the highest/lowest results? What was the reason for young adults believing that the world is getting better with each generation?\n\nThis relates to me and my community because my age group is included in this graph. It’s interesting to see how optimistic the 15-24 age group is compared to the 40+ age group.\n\nThe graph depicts people ages 15-24 and 40+ and how they responded to the question that the world is becoming better/worse with each generation. A catchy headline I came up with was “How Optimistic is Your Generation?”",
