  "raw_comment": "According to this graph, in most countries the younger generation are much more optimistic to the future in comparison to the older generations. People that are 40+ are more likely to have experienced hardships and trauma in their lives, which can make them less optimistic because they see the dark side of the society. Younger generations are more likely to have more hopes and dreams with the development of the society and with their careers. We can see that many countries in Africa show that they both the older and the younger generation are very optimistic. The graph is aimed towards both teens and older generations so they can think about why the graph produces such results. This graph shows a comparison of views, explicitly between different generations and different countries. The scatter plot can compare relationships between the variables, in this case the older and newer generation and the countries. We can use this graph to see the line that has been created to divide the overall optimism of the generations. We can also reflect on the factors that is behind the data.",
