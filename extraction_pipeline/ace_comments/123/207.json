Another point to be made is within the 15-24-year-olds category there are many more countries and many of them are more developed compared to the countries in the 40+ year-olds category. This leaves me wondering why these countries have the response they do and why these questions were targeted specifically towards these generations. As a member of the 15-24-year-old category, I am exposed to many online sources for me to access information on the latest political and social news happening in all parts of the world. I feel as if this access to daily events gives me an advantage and a more open-minded opinion on this matter. 40+ year-olds come from a very different generation and have been raised differently and would most likely not have the knowledge or access to the internet as other generations who use it in their daily lives. Many 40+ year-olds do have the knowledge and are also exposed to the media but in a different way to how we use it. As to what is happening in the graph I believe a majority of 15-24-year-olds said that the world is getting better with each generation because we are the ones who will be living in it for a longer time and molding it into our own world. I trust the results of this graph even though I may disagree with them however, I support UNICEF so I am interested in discovering the reason behind these results.",
