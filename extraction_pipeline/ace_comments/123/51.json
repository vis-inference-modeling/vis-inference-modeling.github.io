I wonder what is going on outside of the world that some people aren’t discovering and why some people think the world is getting better or worse. I feel like in my community everyone is very nice and it portrays a good part onto the world, personally I would say the world is good. Shows country’s and how some say the world is getting better and there are some that are below the line saying that its getting worse. A catchy headline I would say for this would be Good or Evil.",
