  "raw_comment": "[5/5] This graph provides survey data about the percentage of young adults aged between 15 to 24 and the percentage of adults aged 40+ who think the world is becoming a better place with each generation. Although not covering an ample sample size, it can serve as a possible answer to questions we might have about changes in the world over the past quarter of a century. Based on this piece of data and our knowledge of what’s happening around the globe right now, we can take a rough guess at the status quos of each country on the survey list. This can help us to understand the world better through the voice of citizens of each country, while we should leave our doubts on the accuracy of the survey results since insignificant sample size is not very convincing for us to come to a definitive conclusion.\n\nBased off of the topic of the survey and the graph, a catchy headline could be:\n\nSURVEY SHOWS PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE IN 21 COUNTRIES WHO EXPRESS OPTIMISM ABOUT THE WORLD",
