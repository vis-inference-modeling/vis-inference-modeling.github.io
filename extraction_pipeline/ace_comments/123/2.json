I wonder what makes the younger generation of Indonesians so optimistic about the future of the world. Maybe they have an idea for something that they think can affect the world significantly in the future? This affects my community because it shows how much different people of my generation are compared to people who are older and how we feel about the direction the world is heading into.",
