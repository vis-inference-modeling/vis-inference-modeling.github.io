  "raw_comment": "I noticed that there are way more countries with a higher percentage of younger people that are saying that the world is getting better each generation. I also noticed that Indonesia has such a high percentage of people that think in both directions. It's important to know that younger people are more optimistic about future generations rather than the old people. I think that old people just think younger generations are annoying and unpatriotic, while younger people read history books and see how there were wars and bad things going on previously to their generation. I wonder why some countries are not very optimistic and some are. Is it the number of old people in a country, the economic stability, or is it something else? This relates to me and my community because being optimistic about our future generations is very important, and in the U.S. we are pretty optimistic mainly in the younger ages. A catchy title could be \"Excited for the future, maybe not.\"",
