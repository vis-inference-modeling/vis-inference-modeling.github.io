  "raw_comment": "The first thing I notice is that almost all countries surveyed that more younger people believe the world is getting better with each generation than older people. This could be due to the life-cycle effect that younger people have a more optimistic view of the world because to lack of experience. I also noticed that South American countries like Peru, Brazil, and Argentina are less optimistic overall than other countries. Meanwhile, many African countries like Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Kenya are more optimistic in general. One thing I wonder is why Indonesia is the strongest believer by in this graph by a large amount that the world is getter better with each generation. My title for this graph is \"Percentage of believers that the world is improving generationally\".",
