  "raw_comment": "Graph Name: \"The generational views on the future of our planet\"\n\nWe notice how the 15 to 24-year-old age range upholds more optimism in society and views the progress in the world in a more positive way. The slim percentage of people 40+ who view the world in an optimistic way were most commonly from African countries with a slim percentage coming from India. We wonder why the younger age group is more optimistic than the older age group and how the development of each country voting may/may not play an impact on how they view the world as well. As students who all fall into the 15-24 age range, it’s interesting to see how people like us view the world. It’s impactful to see that there is hope and optimism in our generation and in the future generations to come, even through all of the hardships the world is currently facing.",
