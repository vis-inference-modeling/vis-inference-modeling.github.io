  "raw_comment": "What I notice:\nIt is apparent that in most of the countries, 15-to 24-year-olds people are more likely to satisfy with the progress of improving the world than 40+year-olds people. The countries located close to the black line like Indonesia, India, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Morocco, and Mali have relatively less difference in thoughts between generations. Overall, relatively fewer people in Brazil, and Mali are satisfied with the world, and have a hopeful view of the future, whereas people in Indonesia are more hopeful about the progress for the past few years no matter which generation they’re in. Also, the countries possessing a higher percentage of satisfaction regardless of generation are not fully developed countries. The developed countries that lead the world’s economy are mostly located in the middle part like the US, Germany, the UK.\n \nWhat I wonder: \nI wonder about the specific structure or environment of a country that impacts people to build the view of the society. For example, I wonder how the society in the United States influences the younger generation to get a positive view of the world, whereas the older generation tends to view the future negatively though they’re living at the same time.\n\nRelation to my community:\nAs the graph shows, the society that I spent most of my lives in had a more positive view of the world among the younger generation, rather than 40+.\n\n A catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea:\nIs the world indeed getting better?",
