When one as an individual is conscious about the significance of the world's past, present and future situation and the possible outcomes of the passing of time onto one's life, sufficient and concise data is one of the most precise ways of determining if one's opinion can be supported or reevaluated. From my personal interpretation, the graph's aim is to establish a clear comparison between two significantly different but undoubtedly related age ranges opinions regarding an important and especially relevant topic nowadays in order to make further discussions about the data. The topic being discussed is no other than the effectiveness of a perceived completion and overall accomplishment thought of the world's situation getting better with each generation. Data is presented in a scatter plot format with a progression line and pattern enhancing a positive correlation; however, from the data dispersion I am able to identify that the correlation is not strong and that it is more likely for the data to have a higher standard deviation perhaps effecting a prompt but erroneous conclusion of the determination of unreliable data.
