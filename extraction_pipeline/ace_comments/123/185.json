  "raw_comment": "I notice that older people tend to say that the world isn't getting better and most of the people who say this are younger. I wonder why most young people say that the world is getting better. I think this is because they like easier things and every generation to come, their life is easier. My parents didn't have phones, TVs, or video games. If they grew up like this they would know the truth. This relates to me because I see a lot of kids and young adults who are living in a lap of luxury. They would say the world is getting better (easier).  Is the world actually getting better?",
