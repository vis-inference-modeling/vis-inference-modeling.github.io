  "raw_comment": "I have noticed that this graph is a stacked scatter plot, which consists of participants from 7 African countries, 6 Asian countries, 4 American countries, and 4 European countries. The survey was fairly distributed (based on diversity) in these aspirations of generations bettering the world as time progresses. I have also noticed the lack of 40+ year-old participants, which I perceive as a sign that their opinion is rather less significant in this topic, because their generation has fundamentally passed. I believe that 15–24-year old’s are more reliable in this survey, because they are the current generation and could be considered as people who still have time to take new steps to better the world.  I am genuinely fascinated, and wonder how people respond to this question. What is the criteria of ‘better’? Doesn’t their environment affect the way they perceive the world? Due to this, this graph in my perspective is unreliable, these countries are in completely different circumstances (whether it’s in terms of GDP, environment, health, safety etc.). Therefore, ‘better’ is complete bias. Different standards are incompatible. Coming from myself, a citizen of the poorest country in the world, Burundi, my standards of ‘better’, definitely can’t be similar to the standards of someone from one of the richest countries in the world (USA).  One would benefit from this ‘bettering’ and another may find it as a disadvantage. \n\nMy Headline: IS THE FUTURE ‘BETTER’ FOR EVERYONE?",
