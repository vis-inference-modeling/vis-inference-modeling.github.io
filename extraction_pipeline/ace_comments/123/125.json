  "raw_comment": "I noticed that the graph displays more 15-24 year old than 40+ years old. This could lead to how the younger generation is more optimistic and believe a lot around generations being changed, compared to the 40+ year old are more stuck in the past rather than living in the future. \nThis makes me wonder if the world itself it more revolved around change or the past revolutions. How that connects to the 15-24 year old groups are more populated in rich areas. Also why is there a gap in between 25-39 years of age are they special? \n The top 50% of both sides is the representation of how the world is viewed by betterment and generations coming. \nOverall, this graph is saying that how different age groups are being viewed and how that can change the world view of different countries and vs the 40+ year old is more established. \nPossible Headline: how different age groups are changing our world ?",
