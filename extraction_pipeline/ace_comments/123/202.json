  "raw_comment": "[1/5] The first thing I noticed is the sharp variance between the percentage of adults and young adults who think the world is becoming better where the former age group has a more negative view regarding the issue than the latter age group for 18 of the 21 countries selected for the poll. In my opinion, this discrepancy happens because adults who are older than 40-year-old have more knowledge and experience about how the world has changed over the past half-century, as to young adults who have only witnessed the change over the past one or two decades, so older adults usually possess more visual and tangible opinions to whether or not the world is getting better with each generation. In the contemporary world, we are facing many crises ranging from the most urgent public health concerns such as the Ebola Outbreak, the exacerbating HIV/AIDS epidemics, and the worldwide covid-19 pandemic, to wars and unrests such as fighting and skirmishes in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Ukraine, political mayhems embroiling over Myanmar, Egypt, Hong Kong, Algeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, the United States, the United Kingdom, as well as the surging cases of terrorist attacks and hate crimes all over the world both in developing countries and developed countries, and finally to an increased number of natural disasters caused by global warming and the cumulative over-exploitation of the environment, such as forest fires in the Amazon rainforest, Australian desert, and Taiwan.",
