  "raw_comment": "In the graph, I notice lots more teens think the world is getting better but, they live in more developed counties that are wealthier and have better tech. The teens also have a more positive outlook on things than the 40+.\n\nI wonder why people think badly about how our world is going and think negatively. Could it be the long hours and days we were in lockdown from covid? The choices our leaders have made? \n\nI feel like this relates to me and my community because we all look at the world from our perspective and have different opinions than anyone else.\n\nHeadline: \"The Positive Generation Coming Up\"",
