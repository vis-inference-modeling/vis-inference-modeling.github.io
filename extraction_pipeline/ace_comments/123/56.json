  "raw_comment": "I see that more 15-24 year olds agree that they think the world is getting better and better. This leads me to see that the younger generations may be more optimistic. \n\nI wonder why younger peoples brains think that way. Have they not seen as much as older generations? \n\nThis relates especially to my school community. We are all within this range of ages so maybe we feel the same way.\n\nThis graph is showing the different between adults and teenagers/young adults and how they think differently about the world. Younger teens are say thing more often then adults that the world is getting better with each generation.\n\nA catchy headline could be: Is the world really getting better? Or, how do humans really feel about our world?",
