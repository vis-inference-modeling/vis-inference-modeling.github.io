  "raw_comment": "The scatter graph shows the comparison of generation z(15-24) and generation x(40+), clearly with the younger generation of the sample being more optimistic towards improvement in the world. This graph would help us and geographers understand some people's views, which could lead to further research into why the younger generations have a positive prospect on their generation. It's indisputable that for even the most pessimistic country, Mali, the younger generation of the sample agrees that the world is improving. Why would the younger generations be so optimistic, why would the older generation be so pessimistic? There are many plausible reasons for this, firstly, the younger generation is born into a relatively more privileged and peaceful era, the worst a gen z could go through is the SARS or COVID-19 epidemics. I would say that most gen z's aren't hit by reality yet, the capacity for a gen z to think broad and critically is inferior to a gen x, the youth has baseless ambitions for future success, or rather, hasn't been hit by reality yet. Gen x is more pessimistic as they have most likely been hit with life and given up on some, they do not have the important resource - youth, health - that gen z has. This graph does show good news, improvement of any scale requires people with ambitions, and this graph ensures us that gen z's have the confidence of creating a better world.",
