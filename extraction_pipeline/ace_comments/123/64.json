  "raw_comment": "15- to 24-year-olds tend to say the world is getting better with each generation. I notice that there doesn't seem to be too much correlation between which countries are more positive or negative towards the future. It seems there are some countries from around the world, but this graph does not include many others like China or Korea, or Norway just to name a few.\n\nI wonder if the older generation is generally less positive towards the future because they have lived longer and seen what the past was like and the present and future as less good. For example, a 50-year-old who has probably lived their childhood and adolescence without phones and computers and the internet might be more opposed to it than a 15-year-old who has probably lived most of their life with phones and the internet. I also wonder if older generations are generally more pessimistic or if they are just pessimistic towards the future of the world. In addition, I wonder what would this graph look like if it were taken 20 years ago, or 50, or 100? \n\nThis relates to me and my community because I have noticed that my friends who fall in the 15- to 24-year-olds category do seem to be more open to change and more readily positive towards the future. However, adults around me are more neutral or slightly negative towards what the future holds. \n\n\"The World is Getting Better, But for Who?\"",
