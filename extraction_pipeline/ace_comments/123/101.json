  "raw_comment": "Young adults have optimism for the future.\nWe noticed that 15-24-year-olds have more hope for the future. The countries that the 40+ age group has the most optimism is India, Indonesia, and Nigeria. It is obvious that the younger generations have more optimism about the future of our society. \nSomething that we were wondering about is why do these young adults think the world is getting better. We wonder why countries like Brazil and Mali have little to no optimism about the future. We think it might be because they are living a poor life right now so why would they have hope for the future. We also wonder about what people are thinking when they answer this question. For example, do they think that the world will become more peaceful or will their singular life get better?\nThis topic impacts us because we are a part of the 15-24-year-old group and it is interesting to see that a lot of people our age have hope for the future. It is also fascinating to see what the 40+ group thinks of the future.",
