  "raw_comment": "I wonder... Since the survey gathered their results by telephone, are the results skewed? The type of survey forces a voluntarily response, as people will only share their thoughts about whether or not they believe the world is becoming a better place, if they are up to answering the phone. So do people willing to answer the phone have a different and more collective opinion as opposed to people who aren't willing to respond? \n\nI noticed... A majority of the responses of the younger generation fall between the 25% and 75% range. Though it may indicate that people are collectively thinking the world is getting better, it also shows a range of responses. This raises questions as to what factors makes the certain countries opinion at a specific point. \n\nCommunity... The U.S is higher on the graph than I would expect, as I always hear people my age saying \"I wish we lived in our parents or grandparents era.\" \n\nTitle: The Ages of Optimism",
