  "raw_comment": "I notice that for most countries the older generation has a lower percentage of people who think the world is getting better and the younger generations is often at a higher percentage. The US younger generation is at a much higher percentage than the younger generation. Only 3 countries have 40 year olds that think the world is getting better.  I wonder what they mean by the world is getting better and in what ways. I also wonder why they didn't take data from the 25-40 age group. This relates to me and my community because I am a part of the younger generation. \n\nHeadline: Whose More Optimistic?",
