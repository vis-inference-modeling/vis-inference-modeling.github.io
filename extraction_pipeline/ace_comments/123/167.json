  "raw_comment": "i notice how more optimistic the younger generations are in terms of thinking their generations are getting better. only morocco, nigeria, and india have older people being more optimistic than the youth.\n\ni wonder why the youth in countries like indonesia and zimbabwe are more optimistic than nigeria and india. regardless of the fact that the youth are still relatively optimistic, why are the older people less optimistic in these?\n\nthis relates to me as i fit this demographic, i am a 16 year old from the US and i believe the world gets better as generations go by, so even if my beliefs weren’t survey’d, i still apply.\n\nmy title would be “youthful optimism: how country’s youths see the future”",
