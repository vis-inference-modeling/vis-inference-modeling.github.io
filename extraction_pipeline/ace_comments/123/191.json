  "raw_comment": "I noticed that 15 to 24 year olds  typically have a better outlook on the world than 40+ year olds. Morocco, Nigeria, and India are the only countries whose 40+ year olds think the world is getting better more than the 15-24 year olds. \nI wonder which generation/s gave the 40+ generation such a pessimistic view. I also wonder how the 15-24 year olds feel about the 40+ year olds, and what each generation thinks about the others that aren't represented here.\nThis relates to my community because I live in an area that is rapidly expanding, and this also shows what the young vs. old think. \n\"The Future: Optimistic Or Pessimistic? Depends On Who You Ask\"",
