  "raw_comment": "I noticed that, the graph shows a scatter plot of ages 15-24 years old who think the world is getting better with each generation and ages 40+ who think otherwise. I also notice that the survey did not include responses from other countries. \nI wonder if as times goes on, the people who are between the ages of 15-24 will have a change of mindset on their opinion since the world keeps changing as we are progressively moving forward. \nThis relates to my community in the sense that everyone is entitled to their own opinion and many people who find themselves between ages 15-24 may also feel the same about the world being a better place with each generation.\n\"Different Opinions About The World\" would be a title I would give to this data.",
