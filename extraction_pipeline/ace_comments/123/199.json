  "raw_comment": "[4/5] I wonder if the poll is deemed adequately convincing since the 1,000 respondents on average from each country represent only a tiny portion of the countries’ total population. One thousand people out of the U.K.’s 67 million people is a mere 0.0015%, which cannot precisely tell what the people of the U.K. generally think about this question. In addition, these interviews are not done in person or through video chats, but through telephone calls, which means that respondents don't have to take it seriously. This further takes away the credibility of the polls. While we could argue that covering 1,000 respondents from every country is still a pretty large sample size since it’s not possible to cover everybody or interview everybody in person, we should still leave our doubts on the credibility of the polls. In addition, the poll was asking respondents to address what they think regarding the entire world, but most people might only think about their own country, because that’s what matters most to them and that’s what they care about, but what they think about their own countries do not necessarily have a relationship with whether or not the world is getting better. This potential loophole could also adulterate the authenticity and relevance of the survey results regarding the question. But despite all these accounts, this was still an interesting survey that is worthy of noting and further researching.",
