  "raw_comment": "1. I notice that the X axis is for the responses of 40+ year olds, and the Y axis is for the responses of people age 15-24. The data is from a survey in 2021 that included 21 countries. Indonesia has the highest score on this graph, and Mali has the lowest. In the US a larger percentage of people age 15-24 think the world is getting better than people age 40+.\n\n2. I wonder why people age 25-39 were not included on the graph. I wonder why this graph chose to show the difference in opinion between different age groups instead of showing the overall percent by country.\n\n3. This relates to me and my community because the US was included in this survey. I am not surprised that a larger percent of young people have a more positive outlook than people age 40 or older.\n\n4. “Are young people more optimistic about the world?”",
