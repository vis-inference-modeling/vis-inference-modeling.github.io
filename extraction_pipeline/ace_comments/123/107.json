  "raw_comment": "The graph shows if the ages between 15-24 and 40+ have optimism about future generations. I notice that the 15-24 year olds have hope for future generations in many countries. While the 40+ year olds only have hope for future generations in Morocco, India, and Nigeria. I wonder why there is such a difference and what the leading opinions for the 15-24 year olds are vs the 40+ year olds. This relates to my community because I am in the category of 15-24 year olds. I do have optimism for the future generations but I hope that the world gets it together so these next generations can thrive.  I would title this graph: \"  Optimism For Future Generations Around the World \"",
