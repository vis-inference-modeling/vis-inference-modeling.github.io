  "raw_comment": "What I noticed in this graph is that younger people, ages 15-24 year olds, are more optimistic than 40+ people when asked if the world is getting better with each generation. I wonder if younger kids tending to say that the world does get better has to do with kids tending to be more nieve or hopefully, where as older ages having more life experience and a more pessimistic view of the world because of it. This relates to me and my community because older generations seem to make generalizations of the younger generations that they’re “lazy” or “unpractical”, but the younger generations still hold hope for the world. I think “The Youth Perspective” would be a good title for this graph.",
