  "raw_comment": "1. I noticed that out of all of the countries, there were only 3 countries whose adults over 40 years old believe that the world is getting better. But even then, only 45-60% of adults in these countries actually believe this. \n\nIndonesia is the only country where over 75% of its population of 15-24 year olds things the world is getting better. The rest of the countries' percentage of believers range from anywhere between 25%-75%. \n\n2. I wonder how human development influenced these results. Around 15-24 years of age, you slowly but surely start to lose your innocence as more terrible aspects of the world become clear. That may be why so few people in that age range actually believe that the world can experience a positive change. The older you get, however, you will witness so many changes since the years you were young, especially technological and medical advancements making life more convenient for others. \n\nThe graph also shows that this works the other way. The greater abundance of countries whose 15yr-24yr population have high faith in the future may have to do with youthful thinking and hope before it gets shattered with more experience (most likely corresponding with more years of living). \n\n3. The age range of people in my town is a bit over 40 years, and this makes me intrigued to learn more about our ways of thinking and view on if future improvements are feasible. \n\n4. \"Has Hope For Our Future Decreased? Here's 40 Countries' Input for Why and Why Not\"",
