Mali has the lowest faith and Indonesia is the highest. \nWhat do you wonder?: What do millennials think? Why is Indonesia so high? What are they doing to satisfy both 15 to 24 year olds and 40+ year olds.\nHow does this affect our community? Because the 15 to 24 years old are the new generation which will bring positive change. \nTitle for the graph? Back to the Future, Faith in Humanity",
