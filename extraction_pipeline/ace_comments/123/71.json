  "raw_comment": "What do you notice\n\n     In general, the young are more optimistic than the old, they think the world is getting better with each generation much more. There are very few countries listed that go below the dividing line (India, Nigeria, Morocco), and none that deviate far right and down from the dividing line. Indonesia has high percentages on both sides, while countries like Brazil and mail have low percentages.\n\nWhat do you wonder\n\n    I wonder what causes the younger generation to think more optimistically about the future. Why is Indonesia so high in both metrics but Brazil so low? Are countries that are currently in rapid development (like India) more likely to be higher on the scale?\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community \n\n    This relates to the United States because this chart shows younger people  are much more optimistic than older people. I’m not sure where this may come from, but it shows a generational divide about what “getting better” means to someone. \n\n What’s going on in this graph? Create a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea\n\n     A catchy headline would be: Your age and Your Optimism for the World",
