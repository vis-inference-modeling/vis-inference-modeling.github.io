What do you wonder?\nI wonder what contributed the younger generations to believe that the world will get better, does their response depend on the the environment of the country they live in as well?\n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nIt relates to me since I’m part of the 15-24 year old age range, however I wouldn’t say it relates to me too much since although we live comfortably, economically and on social issues things have gotten off track per say in the world.\n\n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\nThis graph shows how different generations view the future of world. The younger generation are more optimistic about the future of world than the older generation.\n\n“Optimism of the future between the generations”",
