  "raw_comment": "This graph serves to compare adolescents (15-24) and adults (40+) and their level of optimism for the future of their country. I noticed in the graph that typically the younger generations had more optimism. This is because the majority of the 15-24 year old responses in the graph were above the line that was used to show how similar the younger and older adults' answers were for each country. For example, India's point is very close to the line, which therefore shows that India's adolescents and older adults have a very similar response. Along with this information, I also noticed that the countries with the highest optimism were countries that are still developing and are continuously growing and improving. I wonder why Brazil and Mali are so low on the graph. I also wonder what determines levels of optimism. I want to know why adults are generally less optimistic. Could this be because they have more life experience and have more realistic expectations? This relates to me and my community because I am in high school and I  live in the United States. I would say that the information in the graph accurately reflects my country. A good title for this graph could be: \"Country Optimism Through the Ages\"",
