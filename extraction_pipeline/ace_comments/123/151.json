  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\nLike many others I noticed that young people seem a lot more hopeful in terms of the future however more specifically people in what I imagine to be \"developing countries\" everyone is a lot more hopeful than the general first world countries where adults don't seem as hopeful. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nAs a child we have grown up in the age of technology meaning we are surrounded by the media. In my experience this means being surrounded with statements about the world dying due to climate change or a political debate or the earth splitting into millions of pieces. However I have never felt threatened by this so I wonder why young adults are not loosing hope about our future. How are we not more influenced by the media into losing hope for the future?\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nAlthough Australia isn't on the graph I still find myself relating to the data. I think some older people in the community are loosing hope and going further perhaps\"giving up\". They are not going of be around for all of our future therefore it is not as relevant.",
