I also noticed that there is a handful of countries that contain the younger generation and believe it's getting better.\n\n- I wonder why the older generation doesn't believe that the world is getting better or is less optimistic. As well as to why there are only a few countries that took data on 40+-year-olds.\n\n- This affects me because I am in the category of 15-24 years olds and others' outlooks on life can alter or shape yours directly.\n\n- \"Age determines optimism\"",
