  "raw_comment": "The existence of Mali at the bottom of the chart suggests that adults there generally believe that the world is getting worse with each generation. Indonesia is at the top so More than 75% of adults are positive about changing times. \n\nAs you can see in Wikipedia that Mail is not a rich country. It's a country that's not very rich and its economy is based on farming, and it's not self-sufficient in food, which is why people think times are getting worse. In 2020 GDP per capita in Mali us $914. GDP growth rate is -2.5%. The country's economy is in decline.\nMoving on to Indonesia, the world's 4th most populous country on earth. Indonesia is Asian’s largest economy. Indonesia's GDP in 2019 was about $1.11 trillion. Annual inflation in 2019 was 2.72%. The economy shrank by 1.26% in January-June 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.\nI wonder why are we tacking this activity？Why only these 21 countries were surveyed and what will this graph do to the future？\nThis chart destroys my previous influence on Indonesia. I usually thought that high happiness would be in developed countries like China and the United States.\nHead line：Does having money really make people feel happier",
