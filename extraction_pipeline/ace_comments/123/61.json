  "raw_comment": "I notice that there are few nations where lots of adults are positive about the world’s direction AND few young adults are positive about the world’s direction. Mainly there are nations where both groups are more positive about the future, neither groups are more positive about the future, or more young people are positive about the future than older people. \n\nI wonder if in general, older people are less optimistic, or if there exists a correlation between a nation’s relative wealth and how positive it is about the future. \n\nThis is relevant to me because I enjoy thinking about complex questions like these, and EVERYONE thinks about stuff like this once in a while. It is very important to our society to consider questions like these. \n\n“How Positive Are We About the World’s Future?”",
