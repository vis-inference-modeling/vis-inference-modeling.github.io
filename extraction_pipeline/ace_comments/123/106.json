  "raw_comment": "After examining the graph, I noticed that the percentage of younger generations is higher in almost every country compared to 40+ year olds when asked if the world is getting better with each generation. This is interesting because it shows how the younger generation has more optimism for themselves compared to older generations. This could be because of a bias towards themselves for both groups. The younger people have more confidence within their own generation. Whereas the older people believe that they are better at managing the world.\n\nI wonder what specifically gave the people of Indonesia the confidence in their younger generation compared to the rest of the world. With the percentage overall being much higher compared to all other countries, I wonder if there is a specific cause to this statistic.\n\nThis relates to my community because I have noticed that much of the older generation in my community is much more hesitant towards being confident in the younger generation for the future compared to the young people themselves. Whether this be due to the hope of still being young, or another cause. It is something very prevalent in my community.\n\nThis graph shows the comparison of percentage of young adults vs 40+ year olds who believe that the world is becoming better with each generation. A catchy headline could be, Do older generations have hope in new generations?",
