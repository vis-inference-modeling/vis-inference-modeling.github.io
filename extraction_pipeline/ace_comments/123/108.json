And it labels the countries on where the answers would put them, such as Indonesia, where is all the ways to the right and up top, it shows that the 15-24 year olds and the 40+ year olds in Indonesia both think that the world is getting better.\n2.  I wonder why some countries are really high in 15-24 year olds thinking the owls dis getting better but the 40+ year olds think the world isn’t getting better, why the drastic difference?\n3.  It’s relates to me because I am part of a generation and their is also the generation from the people below me, so we all expect them to help the world too,  and they should help make it so that people do think the world is getting better within each generation.\n4.  Catchy Headline “Generation Difference”.",
