  "raw_comment": "[3/5] The second thing I noticed is that there isn’t a clear cause-and-effect relationship between a country’s status quo and the percentage of people in that country who think the world is getting better. Let’s take Brazil and India, who have both been involved in unpleasant domestic situations for the past decade, where Brazil has been struggling to keep the Amazon Rainforest sustainable since the wildfire disaster occurred in 2019, and India has one of the worst covid-19 pandemic situations in the world as of 2021. While both Brazil and India seem to be going through a very rough time, there’s a surprisingly huge gap between the number of Brazilians in the poll who deems that the world has gone better and the number of Indians who deems that the world has gone better. For Brazil, less than 30% of young adults and less than 25% of adults expressed optimism about the world’s status quo, compared to poll takers from India, where more than 60% of young adults and adults expressed optimism about the world’s status quo. Not only India but also countries such as the U.S., Ukraine, and Lebanon have also undergone rough times in recent years, but have more than half of its respondents expressed positive views regarding the poll question. This is an interesting phenomenon that is worthy of further investigation.",
