It shows us that the older demographic of people see more \"ugly\" in the world and believe that this will not change as time goes on. The correlation between developed countries and their percentage of 40+-year-olds is also interesting as it gives an indication that conflict experienced in developing countries may give a reason for those in developing countries to think that the world will not get better.",
