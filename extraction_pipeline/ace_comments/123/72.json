  "raw_comment": "I can see from this chart that young people in most countries believe that the world is on a good path. But except for three countries, young people in other countries will be more optimistic about the development of the world than the elderly. But according to a psychological survey by UC Davis, 51 is the peak of optimism, but it doesn't seem to show this in this chart. This raises my question: is this data reliable enough? What is the specific age of the person who answered this question? But when we assume that the data of this questionnaire is reliable, a very interesting question arises. Can an optimistic attitude towards the development of the world really show that this person is an optimistic person? Because in my opinion, this is a very objective problem. I am in China because the epidemic protection is very strict. In China, entering shopping malls or some public areas requires a QR code to prove that they are healthy, but many middle-aged and elderly people are rejected because they don't have mobile phones or can't use them. This will make them feel abandoned, abandoned by the world. This is just a small example, but when we re-examine this chart, I believe everyone will have the answer.",
