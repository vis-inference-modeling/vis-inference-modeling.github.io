  "raw_comment": "The first thing I noticed is how 'Young' people tend to lean towards the idea of \"the world is getting better with each generation\"  more than 'older' people. As in the graph, you can see that most of the 15 - 24-year-olds in the provided countries fall between the 50-75% range, with none under 25%. However, when looking at the Y-axis for people over the age of 40, most countries fall below 50%, and have a significant amount under 25%. \n\nThere is not exactly a noticeable trend among the data, however you do notice that most of the '1st world' countries have a much higher 'optimistic' younger population than an older one. As you can see in the graph, the US, UK, Japan and Germany are all within the 50-75% range on the X-axis (younger people believing the world is getting better), meanwhile on the Y-axis (Older people believing that the world is getting better) all the previously mentioned countries fall below the 50% mark. \n\nThere is an anomaly within this result, which would be Indonesia, as both the younger and older generations agree that the world is getting better as time goes on. This is likely due to the fact that Indonesia's economy has increased by over 600% since the year 2000, this would obviously see a great increase in the quality of life and general welfare of the populace. Under such conditions, it is quite understandable why Indonesia's population generally have such 'high hopes' for the future.",
