  "raw_comment": "This graph is comparing if 15- 24 year old's and 40 and older to think the world is becoming better. Based on the graph -24 year old's are more optimistic then 40 and older's. This makes me wonder if there is some inaccuracy because I don't think people can really concept how the world was when with the older generation. The world is changing so much so fast that it would be hard to determine. Of course, you know major events that happen during history during that time but, if you didn't live through that point in time you can't really know. Also, I'm wondering if the younger people are more optimistic because they have been raised with the internet which gives them more hope and belief that the world will become better. Lastly, do more younger people think the world is becoming better based the economic situation in their country. I also wonder how the graph would look different if you surveyed the 40 and older generation when they were younger and see if their answers would differ. A catchy catch phrase: Countries Optimistic Generation",
