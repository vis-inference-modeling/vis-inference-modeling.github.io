  "raw_comment": "In this graph I notice that in most countries the percentages for 15-24 year olds are higher than those who are older than 40. I wonder what about the people who are in between the ages of 24 and 40. Did they get a say? How would the graph differ if their responses were present? I also wonder how each country is different and how this affects the responses? Like the government, does that affect the way people see the world? This relates to me and my community because there are many people in my life in both of these age groups, so I can wonder how all of them would respond. My catchy headline: \"Who has hope for the future?\"",
