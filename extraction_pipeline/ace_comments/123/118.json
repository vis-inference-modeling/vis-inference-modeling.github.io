  "raw_comment": "By looking at the graph, I noticed right away that the percentage of ages 15-24 years old are higher than those who are 40 years old. I wonder what this graph would look like if the age groups were different. There is a large difference of what the younger age groups say compared to the older as they both have had different life experiences.  Personally, if you were to ask me my thoughts about the world today compared to someone in an age group a lot older than me the answer would be a lot different. This relates to me and my community because I am within the 15-24 year old age group or the younger generation so I get to see the lives of teenagers change and see how and why they think the world is getting better as the generations continue. A catchy headline is \" what is in store for the future\"",
