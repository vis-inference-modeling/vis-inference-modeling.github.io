  "raw_comment": "In the graph data is being taken on the percentages of people that believe the world is getting better with each generation. In the graph it seems that mostly the younger generations believe that the world is getting better but the older generations don’t really think the same. In the graph we can see the percentages in each country separated by ages 15-24 and 40+. There are only 3 countries that the older generations believe the world is improving which leads me to believe that in the countries not mentioned they believe it is not improving at all. Due to percentages being counted it's clear that there is not even a low percentage of older people that have faith in where this world is going.",
