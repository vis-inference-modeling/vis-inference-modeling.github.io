  "raw_comment": "In this graph, I see that significantly more amount of young people, 15-24-year-olds, believe the world is getting better with each generation.  Two countries that I immediately notice have large differences between the opinions of the younger and older groups surveyed are the United States and Japan. For the United States, almost 65% of the younger generation believes the world is getting better with each generation while about 35% of the 40+ group believes this. For Japan, about 60% of the 15-24-year-old group believes the world is getting better with each generation while about 25% of the older group believes the prompt. Both countries have such vast changes with the younger groups' beliefs compared to the older. I wonder why these specific two countries have the largest differences. I also wonder why Indonesia's percentages are so high up for both groups, having over 75% for both. This relates to me and my community because my country, the U.S is part of this poll taken and my age is also considered in the graph, so it's interesting to see how my own generations view our progress of bettering the world. A title appropriate for this graph would be \"Each Generations' Thoughts on the Bettering of the World.\"",
