  "raw_comment": "1) I notice that younger people in “first world countries” like US and France tend to have a more positive outlook on the world whereas older people in the same countries have a more negative perception. In “third world countries” like Zimbabwe and Ethiopia, both adults and young people alike have a positive outlook on the world.\n\n\n2) It makes me wonder if privilege and quality of life affects your outlook on life and hopefulness for the future.\n\n\n3) This relates to me and my community because as someone who grew up in America, I have a level of privilege that others unfortunately don’t. This affects my worldview and it’s important to take into account other peoples experiences and perspectives.\n\n\n4) How People From Different Countries View Our Future",
