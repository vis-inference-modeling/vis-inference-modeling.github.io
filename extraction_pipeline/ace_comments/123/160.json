  "raw_comment": "1. What do you notice?\n\nIt seems that generally young people are more optimistic than the elderly. It could be because of the rapid development that happened these years. For the age between 15 to 24 years old, they were both born in the year around 2000 and experience an extreme pace of development. Could you imagine that 15 years ago most of us are using little smarts and only have the function of communication and now we are using the latest version of the iPhone, Huawei, Samsung with a lot of different functions?  I don't need to explain the convenience that smartphones bring to people's lives, do I? Everyone can see it. With the ability to connect all over the world and share their lives, play games, watch videos......at any time and anywhere, which young people can imagine what life was like before the popularity of the Internet and smartphones decades ago?\nThis may be a big reason for this phenomenon.\n2. What do you wonder?\n\nA 21,000-people survey is relatively small. People aged 25-40 who are neglected should also have the right to express their thoughts. \n\n3. How does this relate to you and your community? \nObviously, people in our country did not participate in this survey. Under the great convenience brought to me by the intelligent society, I don't want to give up this change or imagine how inconvenient life seemed 20 or 30 years ago.\n\n4. Make a headline\n Optimistic About the Future?",
