  "raw_comment": "I noticed that the number of younger people who are from various countries are higher than the optimism from older people. However, there are outlier countries such as Indonesia and India. I wonder about the future leaders of America, if younger generation has higher hopes for the future of the world how will programs to decrease global warming and other issues such as preservation of habitats will have greater momentum because of the hope of younger generation is greater. This relates to my community because I am surrounded by future leaders, the more he have hope for the future the more we will be motivated to change it for the better. A catchy headline for this graph would be, \"The Hope of Humanity Lies With the Young\".",
