  "raw_comment": "I noticed that Indonesia had the highest percentage that said the world is getting better while Brazil and Mali were the lowest. I also noticed that far more 15 to 24 year old's said the world is getting better than those who are +40 years old. I wonder if the reason Mali and Brazil percentage is low because of the areas where they live and that influences their decisions. This relates to me because knowing what people from other countries and ages what they think is very important. A catchy header could be \"New Generation vs Old Generation\"",
