  "raw_comment": "I notice that the younger ages have a higher percentage rate of stating the world is getting better per generation, but with that in mind, older adults have stated the world isn’t getting better each generation. If we keep this thought process in mind, the older you get (in a way) the more knowledge or background you have upon your reasoning. I wonder why the European states are below the u.s within their answers depicting on the same reasonings. I would’ve expected the u.s to be lower, no offense. This relates to the community rather than self only because the community is contributing to the answer and reasoning compared to just ones self inferring their own opinion by themselves.",
