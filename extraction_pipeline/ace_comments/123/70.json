  "raw_comment": "I've noticed that most countries that think the world is becoming a better place with each coming generation tend to be less wealthy than countries that think the world is becoming a worse place like Spain, France, and the United Kingdom. And I also noticed that Indonesia is a pretty big outlier, standing out from the rest by a decent amount. I wonder if that the reason many wealthier countries elder generation don't think that the world is becoming better with every generation is because of the wealth of that country or perhaps it is much deeper than that and is maybe due to how the older generation was raised and that they may fear change or think of change as a negative thing. In my community most teens including me think that yes the world is becoming a better place with every generation, but i couldn't really speak for the older generation.",
