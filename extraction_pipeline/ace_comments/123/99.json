  "raw_comment": "This graph shows how different generations and age groups view the future of world. The younger generation (ages 15-24) are more optimistic about the future of world and believe that the world is getting better with each generation. I noticed that in Indonesia both young adults and older adults are optimistic for the future of the world. I wonder what caused the older generations to lose their faith for the future in the world. I also wonder if the younger adults are biased since they are considered to be the future of the world. This affects my community because I am in the younger generation. I think the future of the world will be bright.\nName for Graph: \"Age VS Optimism\"",
