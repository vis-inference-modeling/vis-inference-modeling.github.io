  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\nI notice the large division line separating the percentage of 15 to 24 year olds who say the world is getting better with each generation versus the percentage of 40+ year olds.  There is stark contrast between the generations portraying the difference in their optimism or hope. I also notice that they surveyed about 1,000 people from each of the countries listed.\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder how accurate this graph truly is. Considering that they are using 1,000 people to represent countries filled with millions upon millions of people, the margin of error has to be pretty large. I also wonder how much the generational effect holds true. This graph would go to prove how people that have seen more have less optimism, but I wonder why there are so many 15-24 year olds that are hopeless for the future generations. \nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to me and my community for I fit into the 15-24 year old category and am a member of Gen Z. If I were asked the same question, I would likely say that the world is not getting better with each generation because of certain things I have learned over the years. With that being said, I also do not think it has gotten worse. Almost the same, per say. \nWhat's going on in this graph?\n\"Gen Z: The Hopeful or Hopeless?\"",
