  "raw_comment": "I notice that most countries surveyed tend to have more 15-25 year olds that say the world is improving and less 40  year olds. I do notice however that primarily Indonesia has high percentages for both categories. I wonder why people specifically in Indonesia are very optimistic about the future. This relates to me because it shows what percentage of people don’t support my generation and what percentage does. When there are big percentage differences that can cause conflict in my life with others who share different views. A catchy headline could be “Older Generations Have Little Faith for the New Generation”.",
