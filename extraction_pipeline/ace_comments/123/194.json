  "raw_comment": "I notice that the poorer countries are saying that the world is getting better every generation and the wealthier countries such as France, Germany, the U.S, and the U.K have less than 75% of 15 to 24-year-olds are saying the world is getting better. I wonder if because more technology is being developed in the wealthier countries it is making life less enjoyable. I also wonder why Indonesia has such a percentage. This relates to my community because I live in one of the countries on the chart.\nTitle - World Question: Is the World Getting Better, Or Worse",
