  "raw_comment": "I noticed that the younger age groups are typically the more optimistic ones when it comes to their views on how the state of the world is heading. This is particularly present in developed countries like the U.S and Japan. Indonesia, however, seems to be optimistic across all age groups, well ahead of the rest of the countries in the graph. \n\nI wonder what leads to the optimistic outlook when it comes to Indonesia. Why exactly do all age groups think the world is getting better with each generation? I also wonder why most people 40+ don't think this way. Is it some sort of bias because THEY aren't the new generation and people 15-24 are biased BECAUSE they are the new generation?\n\nThis relates to me and my community because as someone who is apart of this 'new generation', this is about my future and the state of the world as I grow up and live my life as an adult. World issues and mechanics like the economy, healthcare, and politics are going to be strongly influenced by this 'new generation' as I grow up.\n\nA catchy headline would be \"New Generations Breed New Hope\"\n\nOne clarification I got from the reveal is that optimism in new generations is based on how people think childhood is changing and how newer generation grew up.",
