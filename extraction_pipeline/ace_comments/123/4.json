  "raw_comment": "I notice that the younger people are, the more optimistic they are, and there aren't as many countries where older people say things are getting worse.\n\nI wonder if each country itself has an impact on the percentages. Is it population age? Is it how well that singular country is doing?\n\nThis relates to my community somehow, I guess. I myself am pretty pessimistic on this issue but to be fair I am on most things. It is interesting how different countries have different outlooks though.\n\nA \"catchy\" headline could be \"Pessimistic percentages: Why are young peoples so optimistic?\"",
