  "raw_comment": "I notice that poor countries such as Nigeria, India, Ethiopia, and Bangladesh have a higher percentage of the population that thinks optimistically. On the contrary, more developed nations such as France and Spain have far higher levels of pessimism, especially amongst the older generations. group.  \n\nI wonder why countries such as Japan have such high levels of pessimism amongst their older generations as opposed to their younger foes. I’m also very curious about why Indonesia is such an outlier in the graph. The country is not fully developed compared to its American and European counterparts.  Also, why does the graph omit 25 to 39-year-olds?\n\nThis graph relates to me and my community because we, Americans, are listed on the graph as the US. I’m part of the younger generation meaning that statistically, we are more optimistic than other first-world countries such as Germany, Japan, and Spain.\n\nThis graph is showing the levels of optimism amongst both younger and older generations. A younger audience is denoted by someone who is from 15 to 24 years old while the older audience is denoted by someone who is older than 40 years of age. The positive line of 1 shows equal thinking of both age groups. As a country gets further and further from the line, there is a larger disparity between the thinking of younger generations vs older ones. A catchy title would be “The surprising reality of optimism around the world.”",
