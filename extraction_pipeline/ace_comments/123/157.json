  "raw_comment": "This scatter plot with a minimal pearsons correlation between the two variables (15-to-24-year-olds and adults) was made to show the contrasting attitudes whereby younger people are more optimistic than adults. Its audience could cover a wide variety of people. Because the causation for such a phenomenon could be analyzed through multiple lenses or theories. The meaning of this graph encompasses a much more sinister message for younger audiences under the age of 24. As it seems with the graph, the older you get, the more you understand how ugly the world is, and therefore why they think the world is not getting better. A relevant example is as housing prices soar, median salaries stagnate, it is easy to see why the common person can be optimistic when they are young, hoping to be millionaires, but once realizing the realities of our current economy, it can be depressing. The purpose of this graph is to explain the contrasting psychology in younger and older people and how they view the world. It could be an exploration into how we change our perceptions over time.",
