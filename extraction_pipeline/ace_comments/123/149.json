  "raw_comment": "This graph is to show the comparison of young adults (15 to 24-year-olds) and middle-aged adults (40-year-old) and their amount of optimism for the future. The results highlight that the younger generations are much more optimistic about themselves and their future world, whilst the older generation believes that there is little hope for the future. This is concerning as it is worrying that the adults are so negative about our future, possibly meaning that they see a future that younger generations cannot see. I also observed that countries that are lower in socio-economical status and rely more on religion, such as Ethiopia, India and Indonesia, have a significantly higher percentage of young and old generations of adults with beliefs of improvement for our future generations.",
