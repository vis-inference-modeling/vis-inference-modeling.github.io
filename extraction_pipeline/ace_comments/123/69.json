  "raw_comment": "1. I notice that several first world countries have over 50% of 15-24 year olds that believe that the world is getting better with each generation.\n\n2. I wonder why specifically Indonesia has such a vast amount of 15-24 year olds that believe the world is getting better with each generation.\n\n3. This relates to my community in that I am a high schooler that is consistently surrounded by people in the age range that is sampled in the graph. My generation will be responsible for changing the world for the better, so this directly relates to my life. Most often, I hear that people have a hopeful and optimistic outlook of what will become of the world when my generation goes into the work force and becomes active citizens.\n\n4. The graph displays the percentage of 15-24 year olds in different parts of the world that believe that each generation will positively impact the globe. First world counties tend to have higher percentages while second and third world countries usually have a lower percentage of people with this opinion. A headline for the graph is, \"The Next Generation: Will They Change the World?\"",
