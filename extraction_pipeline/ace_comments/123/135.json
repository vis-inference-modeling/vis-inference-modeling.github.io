  "raw_comment": "The most evident feature of this graph is that the amount of people aged 15-24 believe that the world gets better with each generation is very large, compared to the other portion of the graph, describing 40+ year olds. The second thing that I noticed was that the countries inside of the 40+ boundary are not in Europe or the Americas, but in Africa and Asia. Does that show that middle aged adults are more confident in their successors compared to the west? Another thing that I noticed is that the younger generations feel much better about themselves versus the older generations. The disconnect between young people and older people about the future is more alarming than anything else.\n\nThe biggest thing that I wonder is how the younger generation is so optimistic, given that many of their key development years have been distorted due to the pandemic. Adults have had the privilege to go through decades of their lives without worrying the virus, so naturally shouldn't they be more hopeful that things would go back to normal?\n\nThis affects me and my community because my life has been effected because of growing up in the pandemic. As a member of the 15-24 year old group, I can say that we've been able to find hope and happiness despite all of the negative things that have been happening in the world. I think it's important for the older generations to find some too.\n\nHeadline: \"Are teens and young adults better than their predecessors?\"",
