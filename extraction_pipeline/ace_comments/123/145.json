One thing that I notice is that countries near to the top right corner of the graph (where both more adults and young adults agree that the world is getting better with each generation) are mostly third world and developing countries. I inferred that people are likely more satisfied with the newer generations in devloping and third world countries as these types of countries grow faster compared to devloped countries because they are starting at a lower point. The faster the devlopment, the more satisfied the people are with the newer generations. \n2) I wonder what other factors about the count ries are majorly impacting the data distribution \n3) This relates to me as I am a part of the 15-24 year old range. I personally believe that the world is getting better with each generation. The data also supports my claim as most of the data point are above the solid black line. This indicates that more people in my age range agree with me than people in the 40+ age range. This data also relates to my community as a lot of people my age which I have asked also agree with me.\n4) The graph is basically comparing adults and young adult's opinions on the new generation compared to the old generations. The heading which I would create for this graph would be“What does the present think about the future?”",
