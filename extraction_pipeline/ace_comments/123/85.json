  "raw_comment": "1. I noticed a lot of things in this graph. Particularly how the younger generation is much more optimistic about the world than the older generation. Which is shown in the graph because only 6 countries are above 50% in the older generation and 12 countries are above 50% in the younger generation.\n2. I wonder why Indonesia has such a high percentage of people in both the younger generation and older generation that say the world is getting better with each generation.\n3. This relates to me and my community because the majority of people from 15 to 24 in the world think that the world is getting better with each generation and those are the people who are choosing jobs and starting to impact the world. I think it affects my community and I because those people have a positive mindset and think that they’re generation can improve the world. That affects me because I’m part of that generation that is trying to help the world.\n4. The graph is a scatter plot with a line of best fit that shows how the age of people and what country they live in affects their views on if the world is getting better with each generation. A catchy headline is “Is the younger generation too optimistic or is older generation just realistic?”",
