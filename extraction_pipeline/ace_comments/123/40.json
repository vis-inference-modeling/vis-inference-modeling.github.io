Being that COVID has come around which definitely took a toll on / killed a lot of people.\nIn my opinion this graph doesn’t really relate to my community. As the years went on the City of Poughkeepsie has gotten worse. There's no community center / YMCA that us teens can go to, of course there was violence back then but nowadays nobody can put down the guns. \nAre These New Generations For The Better or Worse?",
