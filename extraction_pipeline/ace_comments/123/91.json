  "raw_comment": "The first thing I notice is that the 15-24 year-olds in the majority of the countries surveyed responded in greater numbers that the world is getting better with every generation in comparison to people who are 40+ in their country. I also noticed that Indonesia overall has a much higher rating of people saying the world gets better with every generation and this was across the board for ages surveyed. I also observed that the closer each country's dot was to the black line, the more the two age groups agreed with the other. For example, Morocco, Nigeria, and India all show that these two groups have the relative same consensus. I saw that about 21,000 and up people have been interviewed in each country by phone. I wonder if certain areas of these countries have different overall opinions and if they contrast from those in different areas. Also, if the survey was conducted only by telephone it could impact the results of the people being surveyed if many people in a country do not have access to a phone. I think a good name for the graph would be: \"The Older and Younger Generations Hope for the World\"",
