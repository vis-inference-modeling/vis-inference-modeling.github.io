  "raw_comment": "I notice that overall more of the younger generations say the world is getting better over the older generations. I wonder why these countries were used over other countries. I also wonder what's different in Indonesia compared to Mali that causes such diverse responses from all their citizens. This connects to my community because I am considered a young adult so it makes me think what I would answer to this survery. Would I be in the 60% of young adults in the US that think the world is getting better? My catchy headline would be, \"Do you believe in the future\"",
