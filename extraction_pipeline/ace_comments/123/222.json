  "raw_comment": "I notice that this graph is showing two different age groups. I notice that from all the countries surveyed, younger people believed that the world does get better with new generations. I wonder if age has to do with the results. I wonder why countries like Brazil and Mali are less optimistic than countries like Indonesia. This graph relates to me because I fall into the younger age group and I do believe that new generations do better the world especially when you think about how much people fought for their rights. Young people's optimism!",
