  "raw_comment": "In this graph I notice that there are more percentages of 15 to 24 year olds that say that the world gets better with each generation. I also notice that there is a higher percentage of 40 year olds and older that say that the world is getting better in India, Nigeria, and Morocco. There are more young people saying that the world is getting better than older people. I notice that there are more dots on the younger people's side than the older people's side. I wonder why people think the world is getting better when it seems like history is repeating itself? I wonder why the different age groups have different opinions? This relates to me and my community because there are different opinions if the world is getting better with every generation and it helps us see how we can help the world be better.",
