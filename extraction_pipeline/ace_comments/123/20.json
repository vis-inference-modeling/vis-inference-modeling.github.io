  "raw_comment": "I noticed that among the older generations there is a mindset of that the world is the way it is and any hope for it becoming better is slim. Whereas the younger population have this idea that they could make the world a better place and that it's not a far fetched idea. I wonder why there is this difference between the older and younger people of the world. It relates to us or at least me because I am a part of the younger population and have a full life ahead of me and so the chance is that I think that there is a while for me and my generation to truly make a difference in our world. A catchy headline would be, \"Hope or Nope\".",
