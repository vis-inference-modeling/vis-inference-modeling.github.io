We noticed Indonesia has the highest number of younger people that think the world is getting better. Based on this graph, there seems to be no correlation between wealth and the perception that the world is getting better. This can be seen by the USA being high and next to poorer countries. Some wealthier countries are higher up on the graph.\n\n2. We wonder why countries with larger populations are not on the graph.\n\n3. We are all in the same age range as these people on the graph.\n\n4. International opinion on where the world is going.",
