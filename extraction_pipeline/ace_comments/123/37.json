  "raw_comment": "In this graph I noticed that there were dots labeled with different countries and I also noticed that there were more people on the 15-24 year olds side than on the 40+ years old side and there are a lot of people who agree that the world is getting better. I wonder why there were less people at the age 40+ who didn't participate as much as the younger adults. This shows that there are people actually believing the world is becoming better even when we still face things like global warming, deforestation, extinction of wildlife, etc. A catchy name for this graph would be “What people think about the world today? Is it better or worse?”",
