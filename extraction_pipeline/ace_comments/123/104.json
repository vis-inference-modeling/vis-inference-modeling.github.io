  "raw_comment": "As a team, we noticed that there is an upward trend in the graph. It seems that 15-24 year olds tend to be more optimistic than 40+ year olds. Additionally, there is not a strong correlation between how developed a country is and their positivity; some developed countries are quite pessimistic, and some developing countries are very optimistic. \nWe wondered why people in the 15-24 year old range were so much more optimistic than 40+ year olds on average? We also wondered what would make people in some of the developing countries so much more optimistic than the people in some of the developed countries, and if it might be because the people in developing countries were seeing positive change and an improvement in the quality of life, while the people in developing countries are not seeing as drastic and noticeable positive changes. \nWe thought that a catchy title could be “Is The World Improving? 15-24 Year Olds Think So.”",
