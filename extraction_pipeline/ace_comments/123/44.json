  "raw_comment": "I notice that in general, more younger people ages 15-24 think that the world is getting better with each generation rather than older people ages 40+ do. I find this really interesting because often people think of younger generations as being especially pessimistic and negative, whereas this graph says otherwise.  The US is one of the farthest points away from the line, with a positive residual, meaning that more young people think the world is getting better, and less older people do. I wonder if what the world was like as the older people were growing up shaped how they feel about future generations - they might be negative because newer ideas and concepts that they are not used to are surfacing, and many people do not like change.\nI wonder what other countries' data looks like - is there a specific reason that they chose to only survey/include these countries? If they included other countries, this graph might look completely different. I also wonder about the ages in between - how do 25-39 year olds feel about the world?\nThis relates to me and my community because I am in the younger generation, and I'm surprised at how positive so many young people are, because it often feels like the opposite.\n\nTitle: The World - Half Full or Half Empty?",
