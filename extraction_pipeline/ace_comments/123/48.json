  "raw_comment": "In nearly all of the countries surveyed, more young people (aged 15-24) believed the world was getting better than middle aged to older people (ages 40 ). There were no significant outliers that had the opposite relationship. I also noticed that the differential between the two was greatest in countries that had relatively low population growth rates, like the United States and Japan. I learned in my human geography class that relationships like that can end out exacerbating issues for the older dependent population. I wonder if potentially that is one of the reasons why older people tend to have a more pessimistic viewpoint on where society is headed. I also wonder why some countries, like Indonesia, were so overwhelmingly positive in their views across the board, but some countries were overall very negative. I think it likely is influenced by the situation of internal affairs within that country. I’m not familiar with the political systems of each country here, but I think it’s also plausible for that to have a significant impact on people’s world views. This graph could be titled “Is the world improving with the new generation? They think so.”",
