  "raw_comment": "The graph clearly shows a larger percentage of people aged 15-24 think the world is getting better. Third world countries have greater optimism with the world getting better hopefully meaning that these countries are receiving more support or are developing at a faster rate. The older you get the less optimistic you get about the world which shows that experiences have a lot to say about the way that you view the earth. The more experiences you have, the more negative your thoughts are which can show that the world isn't actually getting better and you could conclude that people aged 15-24 have less leverage due to their lack of experience and existence on the face of the earth. Younger generations have not seen the world change as much as older people which means that people aged 40+ are able to make a clearer judgement when it comes to the world getting better. However, there is no single generation that conclusively thinks the world is getting better which clearly shows that personal experiences (that do not relate to the world as a whole) have a massive effect on your judgement of the question. \n\nI wonder whether we can ever say that the world is getting better. Will there ever be a time when that statement is true?\n\nGrowing up as Gen Z, I have seen the personalities of other peers and I can say that Gen Z is a forward-thinking generation that is inclusive of all people. This can help the world be better to a certain extent.",
