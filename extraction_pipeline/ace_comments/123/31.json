  "raw_comment": "A majority of the dots are situated in the higher percentile that believes that the world is getting better. These dots are indicative of the younger generation, 15-24 year old, who are in agreement, while there is scarce support for 40+ year old. I wonder why the younger generation believes this. I think they do because this world today is typically more accepting than it was then. They might also be living an easier and better life than their parents and they are challenging authorities more etc and fighting change. I think older people might think the world is becoming worse because they don't like how the younger generation is handling the world today and they might be more traditional, or it just could be that's how they generally feel. It is understandable to say the world is getting worse because today we have more opportunities to make a difference. Back then things were cruel and there were harder situations to avoid. However, times have changed now and a lot of things that are happening don't have to, people are just choosing to and the world will never change for that reason.",
