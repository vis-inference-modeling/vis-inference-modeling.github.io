  "raw_comment": "According to the graph, a higher percentage of people aged 15-24 believe the world is getting better. Third-world nations are more optimistic with regards to the world improving, which means they are receiving more support or are developing faster. I've noticed that the older you get, the less optimistic you become about the world; this shows that experiences have a tremendous impact on the way we view the world. I wondered why some countries appear to be more optimistic than others. I and most of the communities are affected by this because I belong to this younger generation, and the world will basically change over time due to the younger generation. \n\nTitle: “Which Generations Believe in the Future?”",
