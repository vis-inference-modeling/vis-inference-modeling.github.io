  "raw_comment": "The graph showing plots of multiple countries and their older and younger population answering one question is the world getter better with each generation. I immediately noticed that the younger generations are a lot more optimistic than the older generation. The US for example has more than 50 percent of their 15-24 year olds believing that the world is getting better with each generation while less than 50 percent of the 40  year old believe the same thing. I am wondering based on this data could the political swing of one generation also be affecting their ideas about the future. In addition, could there be a discrepancy in what the older versus what younger populations believe is better for the world. This data is important and affects both my community and I due to the fact that the optimism in a community is really important when trying to advocate for anything. The large gap presented in the graph indicates that there are major differences between what the older and younger generations believe is better for the world. That is going to cause some tensions in a community such as mine if the discussion of differences is not addressed properly. A name I would give to this graph would be: Are the Kids Ruining Everything?",
