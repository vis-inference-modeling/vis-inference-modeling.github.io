  "raw_comment": "This graph is a scatter plot graph with a dividing line. The graph showed a comparison between the response from the younger and the older generations. The majority of the younger generation from the 21 countries thinks that the world is getting better, whereas the majority of the older generation thinks that the world is barely getting better. This graph is used to show how different generations view the world differently, mainly because of the different experiences that they went through and the changes they see that happened to the country they currently live in. In general, people who lives in Africa are more optimistic (India and Nigeria have a high percentage of optimism and a higher percentage from older generation than younger generation) because the shift in living condition and economic growth that the people have witnessed. The audience of the graph may be people from a wide range of countries and ages.",
