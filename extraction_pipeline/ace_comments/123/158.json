  "raw_comment": "\"The extent of optimism of each generation\"\n\nThe first thing that I noticed is there is no generation that thinks the world is getting better. In addition, the graph shows that younger people are more optimistic about the world than older people. There are some points that show that old generation is positive, however, when looking at the average figure, this is usually the case for the younger generation. \n\nI wondered what factors made the distribution different among countries. The figures are not concentrated on one side and vary widely throughout all generations. \n\nThis relates to me and most of the communities, because I belong to this younger generation and the world will basically change over time by younger generation.",
