  "raw_comment": "I can first notice that both 15-24 years olds and 40 years olds think Indonesida as the highest developing generation and Mali as the lowest developing generation. This graph is showing how different ages think about the future. Their optimism about which country will develop the most. I was able to guess that US would be popular among the young people, the ages between 15-24 years old, because US is known to the younger generation as a free country, so there is not many limited things, so this is what 15-24 years old younger generations think is good, but for 40 years old, who are already are adult, they might think no limitation  on younger people is not a good think. The 40 years olds, who are adult , they are more into religious countries and I think this is because when we get old we think more about our family and most people who has religions there practice of religion is to pray good for individuals, families, states, and the nation. They also think it might also improve health, learning, economic well-being, self-control, self-esteem, and empathy.\nI wonder what in Indonesia makes the younger generations and the adults to think Indonesia might be a better country in the future. \nThis impact me a lot because I am 15-24 years old and I think my homecountry, South Korea is also one of the country that is getting better as a generation. \nI recommend 'Which country might develop the most in the future? ' as the catchy headline for this graph.",
