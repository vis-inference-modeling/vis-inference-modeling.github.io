  "raw_comment": "This graph compares the percentages of 15-24 year old adults to 40+ year old adults on their view point on if the world is getting better. There are two different generations with two different perspectives on the world. I noticed that within this graph, the generation of 15-24 year olds in almost every country thinks that the world is getting better more than the generation of 40 year olds. I wonder what factors come in to play to have Indonesia presented as an outlier. Are there environmental factors or lifestyle factor choices that make both age groups think the world is getting better? Were there any life changing events that occurred in Indonesia that would make it an outlier? This relates to our community because everything in our world advances on the daily and people are coming up with new things and ways to make our world better. Are these new ways of life actually making our world better or do these younger generations just assume and think the world is better than what it was?",
