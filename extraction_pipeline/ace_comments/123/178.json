I noticed that countries with high poverty rates have people who think the world is getting better.I also noticed that more young people think that the world is getting better, while only a few older people think the same thing.\n2. I wonder why this is true. Because older people live longer they must have experienced worse things. So I am confused why not many older people thought that the world is getting better.\n3. This relates to my community because there are a lot of controversial topics and people can't agree on things. This creates hate within the country. Since older people have lived longer they must think that they had it better before.\n4. \"Countries with higher poverty rates believe that the world is getting better\"",
