  "raw_comment": "This graph is able to show the varying mindsets of relatively young people compared to relatively older people. It shows how younger people, on average, have a more positive mindset towards the way that the world has turned out.\nThe style of this graph is a scatter plot. The variables are the responses of the younger people and the responses of the older people. It shows a moderate correlation between young people and more positive responses towards the world's growing conditions. \nI feel that the audience intended for this graph are sociocultural and brain development professionals. From a psychological standpoint, this audience may be able to use this information to see the differences that different cultures' cognitive processes, regarding optimism, differ with age.\nI think the purpose is to show the difference in cognition between different societies and ages. As younger people seem to have a more positive mindset, there may be a developmental stage during 15-24 years old that could impact your mindset. In addition, differences in culture can play a role in the differences in mental development.",
