  "raw_comment": "\"The Generation of 2021 COVID TIMES!\"\n\nFirst I think that the world is not getting better with each generation I believe because all of social media is just changing who people are in good and bad ways but I personally tend to see only the bad ways. For example people who are young tend to wear clothing that shows a lot of skin thinking that they are an adult and feeling mature. From my eyes it looks like they are trying to impress others with their riches and fame. My mom told me that when you see someone dance you can tell if they are dancing cause they love to or just dancing to impress others. When they are trying to impress others it feels desperate. Another example is body image, I feel like what you see online will make you try it, which can really hurt you physically and mentally.\n\n1. What do you notice?\n- Indonesia is the highest but I really thought that the US would be.\n\n2. What do you wonder? \n- I wonder why these specific countries were chosen and how that affects people and there ego.\n\n3. How does this relate to you and your community?\n- Being apart of the 15 to 24 years old group I find this graph odd and a bit confusing but it makes me really reflect about my past and how it can help me in the future.\n\n4. What’s going on in this graph? \n- I feel like the graph is showing different opinions that people in different countries have about life and also similar opinions that people have with each other. I feel like that this can really affect people and their life.",
