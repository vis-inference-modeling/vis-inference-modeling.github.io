  "raw_comment": "I notice that the younger generation believes more that the world is getting better than their older counterparts. Countries like the United States and Japan have a large amount of disagreement across these generations. The location of each country does not seem to matter too much to the overall data, but there do seem to be clusters of European countries (Argentina, Spain, France, U.K.)  and African countries (Zimbabwe, Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria).\n\nI wonder if the data would be different if the \"older\" generation (40+) was split into two or three sections.  What about people younger than 15 and people from 25 to 39 years old? Are we missing important information? I wonder how this data would contrast with a graph of how each country is doing economically. I wonder how it would contrast with a graph of which countries have different politics and ways of controlling society. How would it be different compared to news coverage and access to resources? This data is probably heavily influenced by the bias of each generation for themselves. I wonder if this data will increase or decrease in the future or if biases are the only factor.\n\nThis relates to me because I am in the younger generation and I hope that the world is getting better.\n\nAn article title could be: A Generational Divide: Are we really getting better?",
