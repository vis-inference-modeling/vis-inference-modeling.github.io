What would the graph look like 20, 40, or 60 years in the past? What will it look like in the future? Also, how does Indonesia manage to give happiness to both young and old?\n3. This relates to myself and my community because I can see, from this graph, how the coming generations see the world compared to the past generations.\n4. Are there better days ahead for the young and old?",
