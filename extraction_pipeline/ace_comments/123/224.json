There are a few places where - by a narrow margin - older people are more positive, but it is more common for young people to be substantially more optimistic.  Japan and the US stand out as having round about a 40% gap between proportions of young and old saying the world is getting better.  This is an interesting counterpoint to many discourses around generational attitudes: especially the notion that GenZ is somehow more 'cynical', and also the evidence that the younger generation has a much worse time than the baby boomers when it comes to job security and home ownership prospects.",
