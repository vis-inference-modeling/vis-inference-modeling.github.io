  "raw_comment": "I noticed that most countries seem to have more teenagers/young adults who think the world is getting better than people over 40. I wonder what reason this is for, is it more confidence in one’s own race, or is there another reason for this trend? This relates to my community because I am in the age range for that first group, being a teenager. A good headline could be “most young adults have more confidence in newer generations that older adults.” I know it’s long, but this is a strange graph to find a headline for.",
