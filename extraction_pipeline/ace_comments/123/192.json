I also notice that Indonesia has the highest percentage of people, while Mali has the lowest. I also notice that Japan has the highest difference between the percentages of adults 40+ and the 15 to 24 year-olds. \n\nWonder- I wonder what the common thread is between the countries and the way they are presented on this graph. Is this because of their government? Their location? What other factors play a role? I am also curious about what the results of this graph would be 100 years ago. \n\n-This relates too me because this is key to understanding the way that the people around me view the world. \n\nHeadline- The Generations of Countries Have Different Outlooks on the World.",
