  "raw_comment": "The first thing I notice is the clear lean in the graph that favors towards most countries having a higher percentage of 15-24-year-olds who are optimistic about the future of our world. I also notice that Morocco, Nigeria, and India are the only countries where this is not true, and the 40+-year-olds are most optimistic.\n\nI wonder why this might be the case for these 3 countries. A generational change in world view? Is it politically, economically, or culturally based? The US and Ukraine have similar outlooks; however, they are very different counties. What might be common between these two countries that causes similar percentages?\n\nThis relates to my community and I through the idea that we are a data point on this graph. This graph can help us understand not only where we as a generation stand in terms out the future outlook, but where we as a country stand in respect to other countries. This may be able to shorten a generational gap, allowing us to put ourselves in our elders shoes and better understand their point of view.\n\nThis graph compares each countries percentage of 15-24 year olds who have an optimistic outlook on the future of our world, and the percentage of 40+ year olds who don't. A catchy title for this graph might be \"The Generational Divide\"",
