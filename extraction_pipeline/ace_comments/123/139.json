  "raw_comment": "This scatter plot, representing the data between two discrete variables with moderate positive correlation, shows how young adults (ages 15-24 years old) are more optimistic than 40+ years old adults. The audience can be psychologists, therapists, counselors, or anyone concerned about mental health, directing them towards pessimistic adults and offering help. The meaning of this plot can mean the world is becoming a better place because present young adults didn’t have to experience as much pain or suffering the 40+ years old adults did when they were younger. Another takeaway could be that older people have learned the negativity in our world through life experiences; hence, they are less optimistic. For instance, young adults could have big or unrealistic dreams and hopes for their future career, lifestyle, income, etc. But as they age, realizing the realities of how the real world works, it's easy to see why the older adults are less optimistic. The purpose of this plot is to compare and contrast how two different groups of people view our world, providing data for anyone interested.",
