  "raw_comment": "1. I notice that there is a linear pattern for this data, meaning that overall, the two age groups for each country share similar opinions for the future. For instance, in Indonesia, both age groups are the most optimistic of the others. On the other hand, Brazil and Mali are the two countries with the lowest percentages for both groups.\n2. I wonder the factors that affected these countries’ views. How are the two age group so coordinated when it comes to their views on this topic? Also, I wonder how the younger generations (younger than 15) would respond to this study.\n3. This reminds me of a lesson we had in Psychology, about the happiest countries in the world (I’m pretty sure Denmark came in first). I tend to find these psychology-related statistics interesting.\n4. Looking on the Bright Side – Generational Optimism by Country",
