  "raw_comment": "I noted that the percentage of younger generations is more significant in practically every country when compared to over 40-year-olds. This is intriguing because it demonstrates how the younger generation is more optimistic about their future than previous generations. I wonder if this might be due to both groups' prejudice towards themselves. Within their age, younger individuals are more confident. On the other hand, older adults feel they are better at controlling the world. This relates to my community because we are around these regions. A title could be Optimistic generations of young adults.",
