What do you notice?\n- I notice that the country called Mali has the lowest percentage, but Indonesia has the highest percentage of the questions like \"Do you think the world is becoming a better or worse place with each generation? \". \n- Also, I notice that some big country such as India and US, and Brazil doesn't have a high percentage of thinking that the world is getting better with each generation. \n\n2. What do you wonder?\n- I wonder why they don't have not that high percentage of the getting better with each generation, and I'm also wondering about another country's thinking and the percentage \n- I also wonder the standard that why they choose these countries? \n\n3. How does this related to you and your community? \n- This can be related to me because my country is not on this list, and I've never thought about this question, but I think we can make a better world with each generation. \n\n4. Make a headline\n-  Can all generations make a better world?",
