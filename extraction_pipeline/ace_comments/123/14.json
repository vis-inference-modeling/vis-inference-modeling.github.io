  "raw_comment": "I noticed a generational divide between youths and adults. When asked if the world is getting better with each generation, youth ages 15-24 seemed more optimistic than the 40+ especially within ‘first world' countries such as the US, UK, Japan and Germany. Only 3 of 20 countries have older generations who believe the world is improving which leads me to wonder if countries not mentioned believe it’s not improving at all. I wonder if people between ages 15-24 will have a different mindset as time goes on since the world keeps changing and what factors contribute to the populace’s perception on whether the world is becoming a better place. This relates to me and my community since I’m part of the youth and am surrounded by my age group at school but also have older cultured parents and family so I can see the different mindsets first hand between the youth and the older generation. I have noticed that older generations seem to make generalizations about the younger generations and that there is a common agreement among each side with many people between ages 15-24 finding themselves in line with each other about feeling the world being a better place as we progressively move forward with each generation. The Battle Between Generations: Where Is The World Headed?",
