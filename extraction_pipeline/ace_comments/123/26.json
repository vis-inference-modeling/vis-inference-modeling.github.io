  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\nI noticed that a lot of people from throughout the world are saying that the world is getting better. There isn't an extremely low percentage in any place of the world.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why the people who have lower percentages think the way to do, and same for the people with high percentages.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nIt relates to me and my community because the US has some of the highest percentages for young adults that believe the world is getting better. It shows we are a positive country.\n\nWhat’s going on in this graph? Create a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\n\"The World is Getting Better, Day by Day\"",
