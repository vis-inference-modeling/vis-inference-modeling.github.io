  "raw_comment": "I notice that the older that people get the less hope they have for the world to be a better place. I wonder what must happen in people's lives that can change their views so drastically as they get older and experience more in the world. This relates to me because I see my own view and the view of those around me changing the older we get and can therefore resonate with people on this chart. A catchy title for this article would be \"Is there hope for this world?\"",
