  "raw_comment": "1) As others have already mentioned, I too noticed that younger generations tend to be more optimistic concerning the future of their country, while adults generally held more negative views. \nIn twelve of the twenty one countries surveyed, more than 50% of youths (ages 15-24) believed that the world was becoming a better place. The majority of adults (ages 40 and older) who were surveyed, demonstrated an overall positive mindset in only six of the twenty one countries. Obviously there is a disparity in world view between older and younger generations. \n\n2) The glaring question is, why do older generations have generally negative outlooks on life while younger generations perceive a brighter future? I wonder what factors contribute to the attitudes of a country’s populace? Bie B. Sea, from Taihu Lake, cited recent economic growth as a potential cause for Indonesia’s largely positive mindset. Others have pointed to societal pressures (for example stresses of the education system) as a reason for more negative mindsets.",
