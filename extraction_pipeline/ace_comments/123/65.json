  "raw_comment": "I notice that many countries have a higher percentage of young people who are more optimistic about our world’s development, with elderly people showing less optimism. Especially in countries like the US, there is a huge difference, with about 70% of young people believing the world is getting better and only about 30% of the elderly believe it’s getting better. However there are some countries like Indonesia, India, and Nigeria who have relatively even numbers of people, young and old, who think that the world is getting better. I wonder why higher percentages of people in less developed countries say the world is getting better. Does it have anything to do with the fact that they see their own lack of development and then they see how the world around them has many improvements, and perceive improvements from around the world as much greater things than people from more developed countries might perceive them? This graph poses many questions about perspective, especially with the topic of improvement being very perspective based. This relates to my community because I am part of the younger generation, so it is very uplifting to see that large amounts of young people have very positive outlooks on the world. I would title this graph “Optimism: the new divide between generations”.",
