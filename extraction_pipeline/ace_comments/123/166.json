  "raw_comment": "I notice that the young adults of first world countries like the US, Japan, and Germany believe that the world is becoming a better place than 40+ year olds in that country. Countries like Indonesia, India, and Nigeria which are not as developed as the US, Japan, or Germany have an equal and high on percentage mix of each generation believing that the world is becoming a better place. \n\nI wonder why Indonesia is such an optimistic country with the population saying the world is getting better with each generation. I also wonder why the older generations of first world countries don’t believe that the world is becoming a better place than the adults in less developed countries. \n\nThis relates to me because I’m a part of the 15-24 year old generation. I believe that the world is getting better with each generation as many people are learning new ideas and are being exposed to more concepts throughout the world through social media and etc.\n\nHeadline: Am I The Reason For The World’s Progress?",
