I wonder if their location impacted their results. I also wonder if these results will change in the future or how these results would have compared to the past. \n3. This is an interesting counterpoint to many discourses around generational attitudes: especially the notion that GenZ is somehow more 'cynical', and also the evidence that the younger generation has a much worse time than the baby boomers when it comes to job security and home ownership prospects.\n4. In this graph, we see a graph that displays how different aged people think whether or not the world is getting better with each generation. A catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea would be “Will younger generations help make the world a better place in the future?”",
