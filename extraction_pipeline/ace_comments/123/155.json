  "raw_comment": "1. What do you notice?\nI noticed that this graph breaks down peoples ages and surveys whether or not they think that generations to come will make the world a better place or not. I also noticed that people aged 25-39 were not surveyed. \n2. What do you wonder?\nI wonder why Indonesia’s results are so high and why Brazil and Mali's results are so low. I wonder if their location impacted their results. I also wonder if these results will change in the future or how these results would have compared to the past. \n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis impacts me because I am in the 15-24 year old category and I think that the world is getting better with each generation. Also, I think that my community is very optimistic so they will do everything in  their power to make changes so the world can be a better place. \n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\nIn this graph, we see a graph that displays how different aged people think whether or not the world is getting better with each generation. Headline: “Will the world get better with time? Or will the younger generations be our downfall?",
