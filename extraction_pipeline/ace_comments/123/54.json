After stating the first impressions of the data collected in the graph my primary observation is that the overall mean percentage of the 15- to 24-year-olds who say that the world is getting better with each generation is higher than 50% whereas the mean percentage of the 40+ year-olds who say that the world is getting better is lower than 50%. The analysis of this data can bring to the spotlight the fact that older generations may have already felt that their contribution towards a more developed and \"brighter\" future wasn't enough or that more recent generations would not be able to receive better life conditions when comparing themselves with the newer generations. This type of feeling could increase depression rates and a more rather negative outlook towards humanities's future. On the other hand, the data expresses and illustrates how the younger generations are more optimistic about the world's situation heading to future generations as well. Younger perspectives when discussing the future can surely extract more hope and greater future aspirations to bring to the world in order to expand aspect in which the human race can improve upon. Indonesia is a clear example of this, as it is the most optimistic country with both age ranges assuming that the world is getting better with each generation. However, it is also important to mention that Mali is the most",
