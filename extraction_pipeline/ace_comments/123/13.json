  "raw_comment": "I notice the 15 to 24 year olds are more optimistic than wise and see that they think that each generation is getting better. I also notice older people in Brazil and Mali are saying that the new generation is not getting better and that things are worsening, and that Indonesia’s older group are saying that each generation is getting better and better.\n\nI wonder why the older people have such low hopes for the newer generation and why they think it is getting worse. I wonder why a lot of the newer generation thinks they are going to be better and I wonder what would happen if the younger people and older people talked and see why the newer generation would do better and worse.\n\nThis relates to my community because it could mean many things like politics, economy and just health and life in general. Do the older people see something the newer generation does not and are we too optimistic? It is really hard to see both sides and there might be a lot of valid reasoning and meanings for each side.\n\nReveal: The graph is a scatter plot with a line which shows how the age of the people in a country see themselves and how they think future generations will be; better or worse.\n\nA catchy headline I came up with is “Wisdom breaks reality and optimism is hope.”",
