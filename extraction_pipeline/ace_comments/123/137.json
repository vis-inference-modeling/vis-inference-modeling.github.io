  "raw_comment": "This graph depicts the comparison between the 2 age groups (15-24 yr olds) and (40+ yr olds) optimism towards the future of the earth. I notice that the younger generation is more likely to believe that the world is getting better. However, 40+ year olds are not as likely to hold the same belief. I also notice that the 25-40 age group was not included in this graph, I wonder why this was. I wonder why the adults have such a negative outlook on the future, or if it is because they have lived longer and seen more.",
