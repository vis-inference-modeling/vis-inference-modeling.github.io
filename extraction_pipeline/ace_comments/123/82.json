  "raw_comment": "1. I notice that the current generation has high hopes that the world is becoming a better place, but people 40 and up don’t have the same positive attitude towards the situation. I also notice that Indonesia has the highest rate of those who believe the world is becoming a better place with each generation. \n2. I wonder why Indonesia has the highest rate. What about their population or perspective makes them feel this way? I also wonder why the younger population believes this statement more than the older population.\n3. This relates to me because I am part of the younger population so knowing that my views are similar to those of close age is reassuring. This relates to my community because I know many people who are 40 or older, and I would say their views differ than the graph because many parents I know have negative thoughts about todays generation. \n4. A catchy headline for this graph that would catch attention is “Will the younger generation lead the world better than last generations?”",
