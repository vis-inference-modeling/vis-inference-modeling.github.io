I notice that the countries where the majority of 40+ year olds think the world is getting better with each generation are all in Africa and Asia (specifically south Asia). I wonder what factors the people surveyed considered when answering the question. I wonder if people in different countries considered different things based on the economic, social, or political situations of their countries. This relates to me and my community because my generation is making a lot of change (or trying to) for future generations.\n\nHeadline: How wonderful is the world? Two generations weigh in",
