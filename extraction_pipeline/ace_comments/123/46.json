  "raw_comment": "The first thing I noticed was that people 15-24 years old believe that the world is getting better significantly more than 40+ year olds. I also immediately noticed that Indonesia is by far the most optimistic country.\n\n\nHow come the age groups have such a different opinion? Also, why are people in Indonesia so optimistic? \n\nI feel like my community is pretty happy, and I personally haven't noticed any people saying that the world is getting worse every generation. \n\nFor a catchy headline I’d probably say: “Is the world getting worse?”",
