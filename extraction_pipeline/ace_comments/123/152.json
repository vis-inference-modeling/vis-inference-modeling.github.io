  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\nFrom looking at the graph, you can see that often young adults are more hopeful about the future in comparison to people aged over 40. I also see that it is not extremely dependent on the geographical location of the country as the dots are all mixed and range a lot. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI am curious about what these people thought about as they answered these questions. I wonder what they thought defined \"the world getting better\". I wonder if they thought about their own individual lives or more deeply about the world as a whole. \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nFrom this graph, we are able to learn about individuals across the world as well as their views about how the world is changing. This can make it clearer as to how young adults and older adults are viewing the world, and even suggest why the world is changing in such ways. I can learn about my community and how it may want to change the world or keep it the same. This graph can suggest how my community, and many others, want to change the world or suggest how young adults may make choices that are varying to older adults. \n\nWhat’s going on in this graph? Create a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\nYouth waiting to change the world",
