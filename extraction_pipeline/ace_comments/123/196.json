I also notice that the stricter countries have a less positive outlook.\n2. I wonder how many people from each country were asked this question. Was it enough to say that this is an accurate experiment\n3. This relates to me because I am a part of that 15-24 year olds living in the United States. My voice is represented by the dot thats from the US.\n4. My catchy headline is Is the world a better place?",
