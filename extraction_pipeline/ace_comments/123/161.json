The percentages of young adults and adults in Brazil are possibly 31% and 12% and in Mali maybe 28% and 24%.\nThe highest point is in Indonesia, which means people (two age groups) in Indonesia all think the world is getting better.\nOverall, young adults are more optimistic than adults.\n\nRelating to the community:\nAdults may have more experiences, they saw the questions more clearly and may think the world is not getting better.\n\nWhat’s going on in this graph? Create a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea:\nDoes each generation have a good or bad view of the world?",
