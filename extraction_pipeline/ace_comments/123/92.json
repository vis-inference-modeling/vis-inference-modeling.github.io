To analyze this graph, the X-axis is represented for more than 40 years old, and the Y-axis is represented for the age of 15 to 24. This graph is including 21 different countries. According to the data, Indonesia has the highest score, and Mali has the lowest score. Indonesia is the only country in which more than 75% aged 15 to 24, population believes the world is improving.The countries which optimistic in both age groups are usually LICs such as Nigeria and Ethiopia. The countries with higher HDI have a higher percentage of younger generations which the world is getting better than more than 40+ generations. Besides, people aged 25 to 39 were not involved in this survey.\n\n2.\tI wonder why they excluded the age group of 25-39 in this survey and why did Mali get the lowest point? Why older people are less optimistic than younger people? \n\n3.\tI believe this graph is relevant because since my nation is not included in this survey and I haven’t thought about whether the world is becoming a better or worse place compared with generation. However, in my opinion among each generation, we could make a better future. This graph pleases my interest in learning more about our thought processes and determining whether further developments are achievable.\n\n4. \"Is our future getting better or worse?\"",
