  "raw_comment": "We noticed that younger groups are more optimistic and the older group is less optimistic. We noticed that there is a diagonal line separating adolescents and adults. We know this because there are more dots on the younger side. We wonder why the country selection is seemingly random. Does the country's wealth affect optimism? How accurate is the data perceived in the graph? If the data is accurate that means it's good that the younger people are more optimistic because they are the leading generation. What determines how far a dot is on the x-axis? We wonder why there is such a difference and what the leading opinions for the 15-24 year-olds are vs the 40+ year-olds. What makes other countries less optimistic than others? How does the younger generation's impact and involvement in society affect how they and others view the world? If we were to rename this graph we would name it \"The Optimism of the Younger Generation.\" \n\n Max, Grace, Mac, and Cierra - \"Wordle Gods\"",
