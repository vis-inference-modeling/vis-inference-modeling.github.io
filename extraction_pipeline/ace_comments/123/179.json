Maybe this is because they don't have as much greed and want as the wealthier people. \n\nWhat I wonder-\nI wonder why the poorer countries think the world is becoming a better place, and the wealthier people think the world is a bad place. \n\nHow does this relate to me- \nThis graph doesn't relate to me because I am not in that age group.",
