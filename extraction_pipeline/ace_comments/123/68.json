  "raw_comment": "In this graph I notice that there is a common theme in which most countries seem to have a higher percentage of 15-24 year olds that believe that the generations get better as they go on where as with the 40 and above age group, they don’t believe that generations get better as they go on. This makes me wonder if the younger age group believes this because they are closer in age to the younger newer generations and grew up in a similar fashion. Rather the older groups have the opposite opinion of the younger generations not being better because they grew up much differently then the older generation. Meaning, they might have different morals or beliefs than the other generation therefore making it difficult for them to understand how the younger generation is being raised. This relates to my community because we are currently living in a generation that is much different than my grandparents generation. A new headline for this graph could be “ New vs. Old”",
