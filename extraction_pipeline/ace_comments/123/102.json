  "raw_comment": "The top left of the graph is labeled on if 15-24-year-olds think the world is getting better with each generation and it states 40 year olds’ opinions on just if the world is getting better. We also noticed that country’s socioeconomic condition didn’t determine its belief on if the world is getting better. There was great variation across all countries with different socioeconomic conditions. Why were these countries chosen when some of them are really small and some of them are very big? Why did they choose certain age groups from certain countries but not evaluate both age groups in the countries? The graph displays that about 65% of the US views each generation is improving. About 35% wouldn’t believe that though in the U.S.. Our societal issues drive the beliefs whether or not the generations are getting better. Additionally, the US is a first world country which can allow for a more positive outlook. Our catchy headline for this statistics set would be: World for Better or Worse?",
