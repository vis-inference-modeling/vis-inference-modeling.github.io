  "raw_comment": "More people ages 15-24 years old believe that the world is becoming a better place; whereas, less people who are age 40 or older believe the world is becoming a better place. This means that the younger generations are more optimistic than the older generations. I also noticed that less developed countries are more optimistic than some developed countries. \n\nI wonder if the less developed countries are more optimistic because their quality of life is increasing and they have different point of view than people in developed countries? I also wonder what the definition of \"the world is getting better with each generation\" because that could be different in people's opinion. \n\nThis relates to the community around me because I am in the 15-24 year old age group and I could relate to them. It also shows me what my generation thinks of the world compared to my parents generations. \n\n\"Is the World Becoming a Better Place?\"",
