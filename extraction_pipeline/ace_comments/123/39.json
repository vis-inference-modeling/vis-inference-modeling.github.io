  "raw_comment": "1) As others have already pointed out, there seems to be a generational divide between youths and adults. In twelve of the twenty one surveyed countries, over 50% of youths (ages 15-24) demonstrated optimistic views. Adults, on the other hand, reported positive attitudes towards the future in only six countries. 2) The glaring question is why do older generations have a generally more negative mindset, while younger generations envision brighter futures? I wonder what factors contribute to the populace’s perception on wether the world is becoming a better place? Bie B. Sea from Taihu lake cited significant economic growth in Indonesia to account for its overall positivity. Nicky from Wuxi, China conjectured that societal pressures (for example the stresses of the education system) lead to negative outlooks. 3) I believe this information is very relevant to my community. In my speculation, growth mindsets are fundamental to progress. Positivity is an essential part of any healthy society, helping to motivate, inspire, and encourage its populace. I hope that my community and country will work towards improving the world for future generations, irrespective of their view of the future. 4) I would title this graph, “Age and Attitude: How Different Generations Perceive the Future”",
