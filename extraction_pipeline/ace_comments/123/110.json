  "raw_comment": "This graph offers incite about how different generations view the future of the world. It asks 15-24 and 40+ year olds is the world is getting better with each generations. This graph depicts many more countries such as Brazil, Japan, the US and Zimbabwe showing 15-24 year olds saying the world gets better with each generation. On the opposing side, few countries such as Nigeria, India and Morocco have adults over the age of 40 agreeing the world gets better with each generation. Within theses graphs you can also see the percentage of people that are in agreement. Mali and Brazil, for example, both had a little more than 25% agree the world is getting better. I wonder why these countries are so low and why countries like Ethiopia and Zimbabwe are much more in favor of this question. Being in the 15-24 year old generation I think me and my friends have more faith in the younger generations than my parents generation, who still have more than my grandparents generation. It causes me wonder about if your lack of faith in the next generation lowers over time. \n\nCatchy Headline: \"Generational Effect\"",
