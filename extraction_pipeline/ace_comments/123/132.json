  "raw_comment": "This graph illustrates the response of 15-24-year-olds and 40-year-olds from different countries when asked the question: is the world getting better with each generation? It is apparent from the graph that the group of 15-24-year-olds are much more optimistic and hopeful for the future of the world. Additionally, the wealth of each country that is optimistic is equally spread out among countries that are optimistic for the future. I wonder why the difference in optimism for the future is so distinct between the different age groups. This graph relates to me and my community because today, you often hear that we (my generation) need to start making changes, specifically regarding the environment, to have any hope for our future. A title for this graph could be: The Youth is Hopeful for the Future of the World",
