Another thing I see is that the countries that are less developed are having a worse outlook on the future then places that are more developed.\n2. I wonder where in these places they asked people, did they ask more upper class people in suburbs or did they ask lower class people in slums, it really is important that they would cover all of the demographics of people.\n3. This relates to me because I am in the U.S. population and I do not believe this study to be helpful because most older people will say things are getting  worse and the younger generations think that they are better.\n4. Catchy Headline,\"Is the World Getting Worse?\"",
