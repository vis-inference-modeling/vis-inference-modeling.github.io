  "raw_comment": "Ignorance is Bliss?\n\n **What do you notice?**\n\nI notice that in general, young people, aged 15-24 are more optimistic about the future than older people aged over 40. In developed countries of greater wealth, the divide between the youth and over 40s is more significant compared to the difference in less wealthy countries. Surprisingly, the quality of life in the countries doesn’t seem to have a clear relationship with the optimism of its people, with several countries that have a large percentage of its people in poverty or in conflict ranking higher than that of the USA, Germany, Japan and France. \n\n- **What do you wonder?**\n\nI wonder why Indonesian youth adults are so positive about the future in comparison to other countries and whether this has to do with their quality of life, culture and government system. I also wonder what causes people, in general, to become less hopeful for the future when they are older, and whether the hopes of young people are misplaced and a result of naive idealism and the belief that they have the power to change the future for the better. Is it because older people have less faith in the younger generations that they believe that things will get worse?",
