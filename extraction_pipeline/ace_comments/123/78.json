  "raw_comment": "It seems as if the views of the 15-24 year olds say the world is getting better with each generation while less 40+ year olds say it is. I wonder as to why Brazil and Indonesia have such opposing views about this topic. This relates to my community because my family always says that times were better back when they were young but they always realize how far the world has truly come in certain aspects but also how much it hasn’t changed. In this graph each country will be at a certain point that’ll depict the percentage of 15-24 y/o’s and 40+ y/o’s view on if the world is getting better with each generation. A headline can be “Do the next generations have more hope for the world?”",
