  "raw_comment": "This graph compares the percentages of 15-24-year-old and 40+-year-olds on their view of whether the world is getting better with each generation. The younger generation is far more optimistic and most believe that the world is getting better with each generation. However, the older generation is not as confident in whether or not the world is getting better with each generation. The world is so crazy right now, and so people would hope that everyone is at least wishing that the world is getting better with each generation. I wonder what the younger generations have to do to help persuade the older generation into thinking that they can make the world better. I also wonder how these percentages are going to change as the years go on. This relates to my community because I am a part of the younger generation and many teenagers believe that the world is getting better with each generation. A catchy headline is \"Is Each Generation Making The World Better?\"",
