Why isn’t their range + opinions included?\n* Why is Indonesia so optimistic? Is it because of their belief, or their schooling, or something else?\n* How did they decide which countries to interview? Why wasn’t some countries on the graph, like Thailand or China?\n* How come the young adults tend to be more optimistic than adults? Is it because the adults have been there to witness and contribute to the damage of the Earth? Or do the young adults have a more open mind set? Or something else?\n\nThe adults in the US are not very optimistic, compared to some other countries. However, the young adults in the US are rather optimistic. I wonder why?\n\nA headline could be: Optimistic or Not About the Future?",
