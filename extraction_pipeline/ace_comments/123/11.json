  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\nI noticed that there is more buoyancy in the youth group compared to the elder group. Most first world countries are in the 50% column while third world countries are in the top portion of the graph which can show a better value for life.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why there are more youth than elders, why don't elder think the world is getting better? Where else is the data coming from for the elders? It seems like there is only data for 3 countries, why isn't there more data for the elders? This could be the only explanation for why it seems there are more youth being optimistic.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to me a lot as I am part of a new and upcoming generation. What we do dictates the future of the world. If less elders believe in the betterment of the world, we must be able to find out what for the betterment of our own future.\n\nWhat’s going on in this graph? Create a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\n\nDifferences in Generations and the Future",
