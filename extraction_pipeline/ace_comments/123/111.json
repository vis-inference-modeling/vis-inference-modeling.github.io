  "raw_comment": "The graph compares outlook on the future between age groups of 15-20 year old and people 40 and over. It is apparent that the younger generation is significantly more optimistic about the future of society. I wonder what factors influence these results. Do responsibilities or lack of certain responsibilities influence viewpoints? Maybe generational norms or clashing viewpoints of the generations could be an influence if the older group feels uncomfortable with the progression of the younger generation. I wonder if environmental issues may be a factor as well. This related to my community as I am a part of the younger generation and the U.S. A headline I would suggest would be, \"The Opposing Futures in the Eyes of Different Generations\"",
