  "raw_comment": "I notice that in this graph, Indonesia has the highest percentage of older and younger people both agreeing that the world is getting better with each generation. I also notice that my country, the u.s. Has lower than 50% for older people and more than 50% percent for younger people. I was surprised to see that more people than I expected in my country were optimistic when interviewed, seeing as how the U.S. To me feels like one of the most socially divided countries in the world. I wonder why the countries in the lower half have the lowest numbers. Could it be that the living situations for these people are worsening, or are they worried about things like global warming and pollution affecting the world? This relates to me and my community because the u.s. Has surprising statistics. And i personally believe the world is getting worse because of the newer and older generations trying their hardest to separate themselves from each other. A good headline for this graph would be: opinions divided",
