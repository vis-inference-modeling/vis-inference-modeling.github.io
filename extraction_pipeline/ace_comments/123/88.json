  "raw_comment": "For the most part the graph is pretty linear. However in some places it is definitely one sided. For example in the US more people age 15-24 think optimistically while the older generation does not. Now this leaves me to wonder. Is the older generation not as optimistic because their life is closer to being over. Or is the younger generation just not realistic. This relates directly to my community in regards to my grandparents. They always say they are scared for the future of our country. A headline could be, “Optimism or Unrealism?”",
