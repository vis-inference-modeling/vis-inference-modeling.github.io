  "raw_comment": "1) There is a much higher overall percentage of players of color then there are of head coaches of color. And these variables don’t seem to be directly correlated with one another. Major League Soccer has the second lowest percentage of players of color (60%) but also has the highest percentage of lead coaches of color (41%). So “most diverse league” is a hard title to give. But “least diverse league” is pretty easy. With the lowest percentage of players of color (40%) and the second lowest percentage of lead coaches of color (20%), the MLB is, in my opinion, the least diverse league. That being said, even in the MLB, there is a clear gap between the percentage of players of color and the percentage of lead coaches of color.\n2) I wonder why Major League Soccer is one of the least diverse for players but the most diverse for head coaches.\n3) I come from one of the least diverse states in the country. When there is racial bias, it is easy for many in my community to ignore it because it doesn’t affect them personally. I have seen this happen as a person of color, and it's frustrating. I think it is important for people, especially in less diverse communities, to be aware of racial injustice.\n4) The main idea of this display is to show that there is a large gap between the percentage of players of color and the percentage of lead coaches of color. One potential headline is “When it comes to team leadership, are we telling people of color to sit on the sidelines?”",
