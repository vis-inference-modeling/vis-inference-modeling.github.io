The population of America is majority white but almost every sport is a majority black. \n\nThis really doesn’t have that much of an impact on my community besides the fact that I ( a white person) probably have less a chance at becoming a professional athlete. \n\nHeadline: Graph shows race disparity between Pro athletes and coaches",
