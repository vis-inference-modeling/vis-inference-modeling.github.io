  "raw_comment": "In all four of the graphs, I notice that the majority of all the players in every league are playing of color. Every league is above 60% players of color to be exact. However, I also noticed that in the managerial spots for each league, there was not a single league with more than 50% coaches/managers of color.\nI wonder why teams and leagues are not focusing on racial diversity at the coaching positions? (However, I feel that in the coach’s role one shouldn’t argue someone’s skin color rather how their team does with he/her as a coach.)\nI wonder why it varies so drastically per league with people of color in the managerial roles?\nI wonder if the diversity of people of color in the managerial role has anything to do with the sport? \nThis unfortunately has little impact on my community because very few of my family friends and friends in general focus on sports and more specifically the color of the coaches/players’ skin. I feel that there needs to be more awareness in smaller towns etc. However, it is hard because we all live in a predominately white state so there is never really forced racism or on the other hand diversity on sports teams. When I do watch sports I am not focusing on who is white vs who is a player of color I am simply focusing on if my team is winning or losing. \nNew Headline - “Racial inequality is at the top of many of our sports organizations.”",
