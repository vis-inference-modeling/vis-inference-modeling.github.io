  "raw_comment": "I notice that across each of the five sports leagues represented in the graph, there is disproportionately fewer coaches of color compared to players of color. In particular, in the National Football League, only 13% of head coaches are people of color whilst 74% of players are people of color. This means that there are nearly six players of color per one coach of color in the National Football League. In addition, there are approximately 3 players of color for every coach of color for both the Women's National Basketball Association and the National Basketball Association. \n\nI wonder what causes there to be a disproportionately few amount of coaches of color compared to players of color. In addition, I wonder what each of these sports leagues is currently doing to try to combat these disparities. \n\nThis has an impact on my community because it reflects how people of color have disproportionately few opportunities to be in leadership positions or positions of power.\n\nA catchy headline I would use to describe this graph would be: Disproportionately Few Head Coaching Opportunities for People of Color in Major Sports Leagues",
