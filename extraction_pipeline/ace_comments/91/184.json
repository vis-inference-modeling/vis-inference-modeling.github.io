  "raw_comment": "I notice that the MLB has the least amount of players that are people of color but, the men's NBA has the most amount of players and coaches that are persons of color. I wonder if any of the coaches with different sports have higher amounts of athletes with people of color. This impacts my community because many people of color are not able to look up to people of color in their sports of choice. After all, the percentage of people that coach and play are very low.  This graph shows the percentage of coaches and players of color who participate in the major sports leagues. \nAre people of color equally represented in professional sports?",
