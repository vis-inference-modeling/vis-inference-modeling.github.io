  "raw_comment": "I notice that majority of the coaches in all four recorded sports are those that are not of color. Even so, majority of the players in all the sports except Baseball have a majority of players of color.\n\nI wonder what the cause of the ratio between the percentage of the coaches of color and the percentage of the players of color. I also wonder how diverse the races are within those of color. Are they all the same race?\n\nThis has a negative impact on not just my community, but society a whole. The lack of diversity among head coaches discourages those of younger generations that are of color to pursue passions to be head coaches because they have no idol to relate to. \n\nMy title would be \"Diversity In Professional Sports: Players vs. Coaches\" as is captures the main idea of the graph and it's purpose to show diversity among players and coaches in various professional sports leagues.",
