I thing I wondered is why soccer has the most color coaches. I don’t think it impacts or changes my perspective on things because I don’t see the color of someone’s skin a difference from all of us. I don’t think it impacts our community except for the people who think differently and have there opinions for people of color. So I don’t think it makes a big impact at all on my life or anyone’s.",
