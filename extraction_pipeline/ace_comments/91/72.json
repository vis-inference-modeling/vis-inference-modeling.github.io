  "raw_comment": "I notice how in men's and women's basketball, they seem to have the highest amount of diversity in players at around 83%, and a fair amount of coaches at around 1/3 and 1/4. I notice how National football has a high amount of players of color at around 74%, but the lowest amount of coaches of color at 13%. Lastly, Baseball seems to be low in both areas, lacking players of color and coaches below the 50% mark.\n\nI wonder what these graphs would look like in maybe 10 years' time. Generally, we would expect all of these numbers to keep increasing, as a more diverse community is crucial to advancing as a whole. I also wonder what is the current status of other predominantly white sports such as golf, or tennis.\n\nMy community is definitely affected since New Hampshire is one of the whitest states in the country. My community is definitely trying to push for more diversity in sports, and really in anything we do. It's important to get people from all walks of life involved, to better lift our community upwards.\n\nTitle:   \"The need to overcome adversity, the answer lies in diversity\"",
