  "raw_comment": "I notice that these segmented bar graphs show a significant disparity between the percentage of players of color and head coaches of color in major sports leagues. This is most apparent in the NFL, where 74% of players are POC while only 13% of coaches are—a difference of 61%. The gap is apparent in all five sports shown, which indicates that the phenomenon is not likely to be due to random chance. \nI wonder why the gap in percentages varies across different types of sports. For example, there is only a 20% gap in baseball compared to the 61% gap in football. I also wonder why there is such a large discrepancy between the percentage of players and head coaches of color in the first place. \nThis graph makes me reflect on how we seem to be reluctant to have people of color in leadership positions, and how we can do better in the future. In my community, I am reminded that it is essential to uplift and empower people of color to give them equal leadership opportunities. \nThis graph shows a clear pattern: the percentage of lead coaches of color is significantly lower than players of color across major sports. A headline could be “Diversity in Team Leadership: Are We Truly Equal?”",
