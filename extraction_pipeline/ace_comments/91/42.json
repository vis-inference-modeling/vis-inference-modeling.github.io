  "raw_comment": "I notice that MLB has the least amount of players of color (40%), and the second least amount of managers/head coaches who are people of color (20%). MLS has the highest amount of head coaches of color (41%), while the NBA and WNBA have the highest amount (tied at 83%) of players who are people of color. Over 70% of NFL players are people of color, but only 13% of the coaches are.\n\nI wonder why MLB has so few coaches of color -- 2 in 5 players are people of color, but only 1 in 5 coaches are people of color. I wonder why 13% of NFL coaches are people of color, but 74% -- almost 3 in 4! -- of players are people of color.\n\nIf people don't see themselves in their idols -- like if a person of color wants to grow up and become a NFL coach, but they never see a person of color be an NFL coach -- it's harder for them to believe they could become ____[whatever they want to be]____. If someone wants to be a MLB player, but they only see certain players, who don't look like them, they'll probably feel discouraged and might not go after their dream.\n\nPercentage of People of Color in Professional Sports.",
