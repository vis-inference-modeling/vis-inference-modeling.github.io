I notice that the MLB is the lowest in terms of players of colour and the NFL is lowest for coaches of colour. \n\nWhat do you wonder? \nI wonder how this compares to the general population and why there is a significantly low percentage of coloured coaches. \n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community? \nI think this impacts our communities in a good way, because it shows that diversity in sports is growing. \n\nWhat is going on in this graph? \nThe majority of the sports are dominated by players of color (ie. 83% NBA). However, most of coaches are white. This shows that poc get less higher management positions which is a bad impact on our community. \n\nCatchy title: Behind the screen. Is it really diverse in the front office?",
