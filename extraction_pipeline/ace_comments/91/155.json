That major league soccer has the most head coaches of color and that national football league has the least. I also noticed that the women's national basketball association has the most players of color while the major league baseball has the least.\n\nI wonder why the number of colored players almost always outnumbers the colored coaches by 3 times. I wonder why soccer players have so many more coaches of color compared to every single other sport. I wonder why the NFL a sports league with a very high percentage of colored players has the lowest percentage of colored coaches, especially compared to the MLB with such a low percentage of colored players but a high percentage of colored coaches. \n\nWhen I look at these statistics, It makes me wonder if people of color are getting the same opportunities in the community when it comes to different roles in sports. It looks like they get great opportunities to play the sports but not as many opportunities to be managers or coaches in the sports. We should be looking at giving people of color more opportunities to be in management positions at a younger age, so that when they grow up we will have more of them managing sports teams professionally.",
