  "raw_comment": "I notice that the Major Baseball League has the least players of color and that both basketball associations have the greatest amount of players of color. I wonder if there are other sports that also have colored players and coaches. This impacts my community because there has been situations where people of color are treated differently than others. These graphs show that more than half of the leagues people are people of color and this shows that no matter what skin color you have. How diverse are these sports?",
