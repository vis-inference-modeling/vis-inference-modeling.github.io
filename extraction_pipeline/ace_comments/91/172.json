  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\nI notice that the percentage of head coaches of color is less than 50% in all the listed sports. There is a big gap between the  representation of players of color to the head coaches of color.\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why the percentages of head coaches of color are so low.\nWhat Impact does this have on you and your community?\nThese graphs impact me by making me realize that head coaches of color don't really have a huge representation in various sports like the players themselves. These graphs impact my community by not allowing many players of color aspire or feel connected to their coaches. This is because the coaches are not exactly people like them.\nWhat's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\nIn this graph players of color are shown to have larger representation than head coaches of colors in listed sports.\nHeadline: Are teams as a whole really as diverse as they could be?",
