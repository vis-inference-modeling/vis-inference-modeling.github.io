  "raw_comment": "1. What I noticed about this graph was that basketball had the most players of color while baseball had the least.  I also noticed that soccer had the most coaches of color as well.  Both women's and men's basketball have the same number of players of color.  Finally, I noticed that football had the least coaches of color with the third highest players of color\n\n2. Some things I wonder is why basketball has the most players of color and why baseball has the least amount of players of color.  Another thing I wonder is why football has the least amount of coaches of color and why soccer has the most coaches of color.\n\n3. The impact this has on me isn't that great.  Although I play basketball and is a man of color, it still doesn't affect me in any way just because of my skin color.  \n\n4. What's going on in the graph is that it's showing the percentage of people of color who play professional sports.  A catchy title or headline for this graph would be, \"Percentages of colored people in professional sports\"",
