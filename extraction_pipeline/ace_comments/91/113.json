  "raw_comment": "1. What do you notice?\nI notice that all of the leagues depicted, except Major League Baseball, have a majority of players of color. I also notice that the percentage of head coaches of color are all under 50% in all these graphs.\n2. What do you wonder?\nI wonder why there aren’t more head coaches of color in these leagues. I also wonder why there isn't more diversity in Major League Baseball.\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nI certainly didn’t know about the lack of diversity in head coaches of color in sports leagues. I now feel like I’m a little more aware of racism in sports. I feel inclined to do more research to further educate myself.\n4. What’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\n“Is Diversity Out of Our League?”",
