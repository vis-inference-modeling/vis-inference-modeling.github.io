  "raw_comment": "I notice that a majority of the players are of color but very few coaches are of color. \nI wonder What stops these women to become coaches after their sporting careers. I wonder if many of the people paying for these sports to happen do not want to see people of color in charge. \nThis impacts my community because While I get to see representation of myself, there is still not enough representation of coaches that are people of color.\nThis graph shows the disparities of people of color in higher positions in sports legues. \nA catchy headline could be “Women of Color Need More Representation High Up in Sports leagues.”",
