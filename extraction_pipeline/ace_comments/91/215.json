The highest of which being the mls with 41% of coaches being someone of color.\n2) I wonder why there is such a lack of coaches of color in certain leagues, I also wonder how many( the actual number, not the percentage) there are and if any of them are woman( mainly talking about the coaches)\n3)This has no impact on me. Except that I am happy to see an increase in diversity.\n4) Players and Coaches of color, know the percent.",
