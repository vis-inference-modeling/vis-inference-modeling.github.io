  "raw_comment": "I notice in every sport listed there is more people of color than the white coaches. There is approximately 50 percent or more people of color in every sport category except  for major league soccer. I wonder why major league soccer is almost 50/50 for people of color and the white coaches but the rest of the sports are 50 percent or more different. This doesn't impact my community in a bad way me being a person of color there are more Hispanics, African, Asians, than more white people in our world.  In sports more people of color, than the other!",
