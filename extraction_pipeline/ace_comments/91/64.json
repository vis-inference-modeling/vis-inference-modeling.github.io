Since players in these categories have lower years played in the field than coaches because playing takes a giant toll on your body compared to coaching.\n\nThis impacts my community because New Hampshire is not a very diverse place. This impacts the judgment of us and how we view sports. There are some teams with a few people of color but it is mostly white.\n\n“Diversity, seen on the field but not the sidelines.”",
