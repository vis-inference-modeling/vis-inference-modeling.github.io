  "raw_comment": "We notice that the national basketball associations have the highest percentages of players of color of all the sports. After the basketball associations, the national football league has the second highest percentage of players of color. I also notice that the head coaches of color don't even come close to the percentage of players of color. Soccer has the highest percentage of coaches of color which makes sense since it is a more worldly sport. The more “American” sports tend to have lower diversity in coaching staff. These sports would be football and baseball. We wonder why there are less coaches of color overall compared to players of color. Is it because there are simply more players of color or is it due to discrimination amongst coaches in those specific sports/leagues. Also, what could be the criteria/standards for being a coach? Maybe there’s a specific reason why there are more players of color rather than pursuing a head coach career. This graph impacts our community by highlighting the lack of coaches and even people of color in leadership positions throughout school sports. This puts emphasis on the issue of racial inequality in the sports system. We think that if there were more coaches of color there would be more kids of color that would feel comfortable participating in these activities and that kids of color would also get more opportunities in the sport they chose to participate in. \nCatchy Headline: The lack of diversity in sports leadership",
