  "raw_comment": "I notice that in the most recent year (only one given) for each of these major sports leagues, those with the largest disparity between the percentage of players of color and leadership of color are the NFL (61% gap), followed by the WNBA (58% gap) and then the NBA (50% gap). It’s interesting that the leagues with the smallest gaps (MLB & MLS) have fewer players of color also.\n\nI wonder how these percentages compare to those from previous years. What are these initiatives referenced? Have the leagues shown progress? How are the players within these leagues affected by these gaps and are their concerns being addressed?\n\nAs a high school teacher, I think of how data like this affects my students. While those within the POC community could be encouraged by the percentage of players of color within the leagues, what difficult thoughts/questions come when they see the lack of representation in the leadership percentages. When seeing this data, would my students be motivated to dig deeper, asking themselves “Are others concerned about this?” or “What is being done about it?” My hope is that, despite their initial reaction, they would find their voice to ask the questions troubling them and their power to research and advocate further!\n\nDespite progress or initiatives that have been implemented to address the discrepancies seen above, more work needs to be done. Catchy headline? “Commissioners: Mind the Gap!”",
