  "raw_comment": "I notice that these graphs separately display the percentages of players of color and coaches of color across different sports leagues of the nation. Along with this, the athletes of color seem to be well represented, in some circumstances even being the majority, however, in all of the leagues there seems to be an inequality for white coaches compared to coaches of color.\n\nI wonder how these graphs have shifted over time since the beginning of integration in sports. Obviously, at one point there was a time that people of color weren’t even allowed in the American leagues. I wonder if once the ban was lifted, the levels of diversity in athletes slowly increased or if there was a certain point where they skyrocketed.\n \nThis does not affect me directly, however it affects the people around me and in my community as it shows the representation of people of color in sports across America. It shows that athletes are extremely diverse, and in some cases, the majority of athletes are people of color, however, regarding coaches, there is not as much of a representation. This shows some employment opportunities could still have segregation involved, and there’s room to improve going forward.\n\nThis graph depicts the level of diversity in both athletes and coaches across 5 sports leagues of America.\n \nCatchy Headline: The Diversity and Disparity of American Sports",
