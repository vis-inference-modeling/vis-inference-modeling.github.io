  "raw_comment": "“The Never Ending Game Against Racism, but is the Game Even Fair?” \n\nI noticed that there is a higher percentage of players of color than head coaches of color. This speaks volumes in that it is less so lack of opportunity but lack of ability for POC to move up in the industries that our society lives off of. The fact of the matter is that there is so much more that goes into the earnings of leadership roles, like coaching as opposed to roles such as players, that stretches beyond talent and ability and starts to fall into the unwarranted areas of politics and duplicity.  \n\nI wonder why the number of colored players almost always outnumbers the colored coaches by 3 times. I wonder why this is even an occurring issue. How could we eliminate the obstacles present in the sports industry that people of color face that enable them from achieving the same positions as caucasians?\n\nThe impact this issue has on my community is ever so present and relevant, and has been for the last 400 years. Although I live in a predominately white community, this issue is still present. If this is occurring on such page platforms such as the professional sport industry, it is indubitably present in smaller proportions.\n\nThe graph clearly displays the discrepancy between the percentage of lead coaches of color and the percentage of players who are of color in the major league sports industry. It clearly shows that the amount of colored players is much higher than the amount of coaches of color.",
