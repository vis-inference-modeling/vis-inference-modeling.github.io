  "raw_comment": "This graph displays the racial disparity in different major sports leagues. It shows the percent players of color and the percent coaches of color. Both the womens and mens NBA have the highest percentage of players of color at 83% and the MLB has the smallest at 40% of players.\nI wonder why they chose to only incorporate one women's sport association. I also wonder what these graphs have looked like in previous years, how much have they changed throughout the years?\nOur community is predominantly white and seeing this data impacts us by giving us a better understanding of the diversity of sports across the US. It also implies that people of color are not represented enough in the coaching community and may not be given as many opportunities.",
