  "raw_comment": "I notice that the visual shows the percentages of POC players as well as POC coaches in different professional sports. The only sport listed which has majority white players is Major League Baseball. The rest of the sports listed have majority POC players. Every sport listed has a fairly low number of POC coaches. The majority of coaches seem to be white. I wonder if racism embedded into the sports industry prevents people of minoritized ethnicities from becoming coaches. I also wonder why such a large percentage of baseball players are white. Do former sports players become coaches? If so, why are the racial demographics of coaches so different from the racial demographics of players?\n\nThis impacts my community because my city has several sports teams (a basketball team, a baseball team, and a soccer team). My city also has a majority Black population. It is very possible that African American coaches in my city are discriminated against and have trouble finding jobs coaching major teams.\n\nHeadline: Where are the coaches of color?",
