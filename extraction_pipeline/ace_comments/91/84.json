  "raw_comment": "I notice that soccer has the highest number of colored coaches, yet the player diversity ratio is the second-lowest: standing at 60%.  To compare, the NBA and WNBA have the highest listed colored players. Also, there is a larger amount of diversity for players and not coaches.\n\nI wonder why the diversity percentage is so much bigger for players rather than the coaches? Is there a specific reason, like how many teams are in the sport, or is it because there are more players than coaches. I am also curious as to how each sport differs based on color.",
