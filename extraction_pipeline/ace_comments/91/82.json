  "raw_comment": "After examining each graph, I noticed that four of the five sports listed have done a great job of diversifying their players. However, all are rather lacking in the diversification of those in leadership positions. I also noticed that in sports like Basketball, a sport dominated by people of color, the number of head coaches of color is rather low. The percentage of head coaches of color is even beaten out by soccer, which has 23% less players of color. I wonder why sports like football and basketball, which are dominated by people of color, have so few people of color in leadership positions. I also wonder why baseball, when compared to the other sports given, has such a low number of players of color. This impacts myself and my community as I live in New Hampshire, one of the whitest states in the country. I would imagine that if you were to explore these statistics for highschool or college sports in New Hampshire that the results would be even more profound. While it is clear from the graph that people of color now have a well deserved place in the player base, it also shows that work can be done amongst coaches. Therefore, this graph provides possible insight into what these numbers could look like within New Hampshire.\n\nPossible Headline-“Leadership positions fall behind in diversity”",
