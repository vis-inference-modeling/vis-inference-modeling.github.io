  "raw_comment": "I notice that for all of the professional sports there are more players than coaches that are people of color. Also the sport with the highest number of colored coaches is soccer but they have the second lowest percentage of players of color out of the five sports.\n\nI wonder why Major League Baseball is so much lower in their percentage of players of color than the rest of the sports?\n\nThis has an impact on my community because it may influence younger players, that are joining sports, decisions to play or not based off of pressure and expectations \n\n“Have Professional Sports Ever Been Equal to All and Will They Ever Be?”",
