  "raw_comment": "I noticed that there is a higher percentage of colored players than colored coaches on any one of these major sports. However, baseball has the lowest percentage of colored individuals on the team. \n\nI wonder why people of color are not hired to higher positions in the sports industry. This could be because they are coincidentally not qualified enough or just because of racism. \n\nThis graph tells me that people of color from my generation can play sports without feeling left out or underrepresented. The issue here is that the coaches' data is not showing as much diversity as the player data. This could be discouraging to individuals of color- showing that it's not possible for them to accomplish more than just playing the sport. \n\nMy headline for this graph would be \"Is Diversity Balanced Between Coaches and Players?\"",
