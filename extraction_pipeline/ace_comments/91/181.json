  "raw_comment": "1. What do you notice?\nI notice that the percentage of players of color in the NBA and WNBA is the same (83%). The League(s) with the highest percentage of players of color are the NBA and the WNBA, while the league with the lowest percentage of players of color is the MLB. In all five of the leagues shown, there is a higher proportion of players of color than there are head coaches of color.\n \n2. What do you wonder?\nI wonder if we would get results like these with data from other leagues around the world such as the English Premier League, or the CBA. \n  \n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis shows me that coaching staffs are often not as diverse as the teams themselves. With less diverse coaching staffs, there are not as many people of color in coaching positions to look up to.\n \n4. Headline: “Are Sports Really as Diverse as we think?”",
