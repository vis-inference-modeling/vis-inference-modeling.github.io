  "raw_comment": "When glancing at the graphs, I notice that the NFL has the 3rd highest percentage of athletes of color, however, it has the lowest percentage of coaches of color. This contrasts with the MLS, in which 60% of players are of color, but 41% of coaches are of color, which is easily the highest percentage out of all American major league sports.\n\nI wonder what history has to do with this.  Do certain sports have a lower or higher player/coach percentage of color because of its history, or is there no relationship.  In addition to this, why does MLS have the best ratio of player to coach?\n\nSports is one of the if not the most popular pastime in America. Millions attend and watch games from either the stands, or more likely during our current situation, over television.  The graphs given show America's history, and the inequality that has existed between those of color and those not.  \n\n“America’s history is hidden within our favorite sports.”",
