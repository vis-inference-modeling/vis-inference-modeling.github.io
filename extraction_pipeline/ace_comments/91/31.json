  "raw_comment": "I noticed that in basketball and football the majority of players are people of color with around 80% being people of color. In soccer around 60% are people of color and in baseball only about 40% are people of color. I also noticed that the majority of head coaches are not people of color. I wonder why football, basketball, and soccer have a majority of players being people of color but not baseball. Our community is impacted because it shows that people of color have an equal opportunity to be a player in some sports. It also impacts our community by showing that people of color have a lower chance to be in positions of power as shown in statistics for head coaches. I would title the graph \"How Diverse are Major League Sports?\"",
