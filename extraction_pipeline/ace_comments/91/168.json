  "raw_comment": "I notice that the data all comes from 2020 except for the WNBA, which used 2019. This data could have been used since the percentage of player of color (83%) matched the NBA percentage of 2020. I also notice how the MLB's players of color (40%) equal less than half of the NBA or WNBA (83%). \n\nI wonder why the data of the WNBA was not available for the 2020 season. I also wonder why overall there are much less head coaches of color per team than players of color. Could this be because there are just more players, or are head coaches discriminated against in these leagues.\n\nThis data may impact my community by discouraging people of color in pursuing a coaching career due to its lack of diversity. On the other hand, this data may encourage people of color to continue working at their sport (besides MLB which is 40% players of color) in order to make a career.\n\nDiversity in Professional Teams",
