  "raw_comment": "I've noticed that there aren't as many players of color in the MLB than any other league, I think this is due to the years of race and context behind the sport. I also noticed the NFL has the smallest proportion of coaches of color. That surprises me because a lot of people of color play football.\n\nI wonder how in the future if these stats will go up or down for people with color, and I also wonder if it will only be certain ones that go up or down. it looks like these numbers have gone up for colored people so I expect them to keep going up for them still.\n\nI think this impacts me and my community because it goes to show that we are all equal and want to end racism. Also it shows us that this world isn't so bad after all.\n\nwhat going ronin this graph is that people of color are starting to have more and more rule over sports and they are starting to have more and more people in there doing the things that they love and proving they can.",
