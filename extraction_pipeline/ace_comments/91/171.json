  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\nThe ratio of players of color in each sport is significantly larger than the percentage of coaches. NFL has the largest gap with 61% and MLS has the smallest with 19%. The MLS actually has the largest percentage of head coaches of color. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder if other leagues, especially the European leagues have similar numbers. \n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nYoung people can look up to the many athletes in the different sports. The athletes do not have many coaches to look up to, from similar background that understands them. Coaching is not diverse.\n\nWhat’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\n\nYou can became a professional player but not a head coach based on your skin color.",
