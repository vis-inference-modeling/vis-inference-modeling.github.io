  "raw_comment": "- I notice that the majority of players (at least 60%) are people of color in all sports leagues except for Baseball. Another observation I made was that a much smaller percentage (maximum of 41%) of head coaches are people of color. \n- I wonder why there are so few colored head coaches despite there being a diverse league of players. I also question why the graph specified \"Women\" in the National Basketball Association, but not for the other leagues.\n- This impacts our community because the major sports leagues fail to have a diverse set of head coaches. The data indicates that people of color have a disadvantage in becoming a head coach compared to non-colored people. \n- A catchy headline for this graph would be \"Racial Diversity in Sports: What are the Percentages of Players and Coaches of Color in Major Sports Leagues?\"",
