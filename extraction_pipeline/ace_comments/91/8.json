  "raw_comment": "What I noticed: I noticed that baseball has the lowest percentage of colored players.  The players have higher rates of colored players than that of the coaches, and only baseball has less than 50% of their payers identify as colored.  The Women's National Basketball Association and the National Basketball Association both have the same percentage of colored players, and similar percentages of colored coaches.\n\nWhat I wonder:  Why are the coaches so much less diverse than the players?  What may have caused this? Does the time at which the data was recorded affect the amount of diversity?\n\nImpact: This graph has the potential to impact our community both positively and negatively.  Although it does promote racial equality in sports by encouraging the fact that people of color are able to be treated equally, it also shows that there is a lack of diversity among the coaches, which could potentially spread the message that people of color are less worthy of leading than those not of color.\n\nHeading: Are Sports Teams Really as Diverse as We Think?",
