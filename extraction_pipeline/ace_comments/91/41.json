  "raw_comment": "I noticed that in the NFL, WNBA, NBA, and MLS, majority of the players are people of color. In the MLB, 40% of the players are people of color. Additionally, majority of the head coaches are not people of colors. The NFL has the least number of colored head coachers, at 13%, while the MLS has the largest number of colored head coaches, at 41%. I wonder why in some sports, there are so many players of color, and less coaches of color. Since I am a person of color, this has an impact on me, as it proves to me that there is diversity in sports, and that race isn't a deciding factor when joining a sports team. This graph shows the percentage of colored sports players and the percentage of colored head coaches on sports teams. A good name for this graph would be \"The Percentage of Diversity in Sports Leagues.\"",
