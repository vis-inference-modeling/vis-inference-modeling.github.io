  "raw_comment": "1. I noticed that this graph shows the players and coaches of color for major sports leagues. \n2. I wonder why the baseball league doesn't have as high of a percentage of players of color as the other leagues. I wonder how many league members are not included in these results, since the data is self-reported.  \n3. This shows how open my community is in making sports leagues more diverse. It impacts the way diversity is shown through sports. \n4. The graph is basically demonstrating the percentage of players and coaches of color in major sports leagues. A catchy headline would be \"Diversity: High or Low Percentage in Major Sports Leagues\"",
