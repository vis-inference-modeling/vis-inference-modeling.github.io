Unlike the coaches, with the majority being mostly white. \nWhat do you Wonder?\nI wonder if the year that the data was taken affected the results because of the world diversifying. \nWhat is the impact on my community?\nSports slowly becoming more diverse helps my community because of the idolization of different races to inspire some young people of color to strive for being a professional athlete or coach.\n\nDiversity is quickly escalating in the recent years of professional sports.",
