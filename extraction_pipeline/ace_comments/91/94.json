I wonder how the players feel when being led by someone who they can't relate to or have had the same experiences? \n\n3) It could have a big impact on the way we see ourselves. Living in an area filled with people of color  we see the lack of representation in the higher-up positions. The graph would make others around me believe that they wouldn't be able to coach or have a better job.\n\n4) Headline: Difference in positions for people of color on the sports field.",
