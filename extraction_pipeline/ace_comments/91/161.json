  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\nI noticed that there are different percentages between the players of color and the head coaches of color. For player of color, they have a higher percentage then the head coaches of color.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why head coaches of color have a low percentage?\n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis impacts on me because this shows to me that there is still racism going on. There should be a reason as to why head coaches of color have such a low percentage. This impacts the community because not so many head coaches of color have the opportunity to be involved in the major sports leagues. Which is unfair. \n\nWhat’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\nThe Diversity in Sports",
