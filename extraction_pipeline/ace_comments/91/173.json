The players of color has more percentage than the head coaches of color. I also notice that there are only 4 graphs from 2020 and 1 graph from 2019 and that’s from the Women’s National Basketball Association. \n\n2. What do you wonder? \nI wonder if there is a reason why there are more players of color than head coaches of color.\n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nSince my community is more diverse and has a lot of people of color, I think the percentage in them becoming players is high but maybe the amount of coaches that they could relate to would be difficult for them. \n\n4. What’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graphs main idea.\nThis graph shows the difference in players of color and head coaches of color overall. A headline would be: “The difference in players of color and head coaches of color in sports.”",
