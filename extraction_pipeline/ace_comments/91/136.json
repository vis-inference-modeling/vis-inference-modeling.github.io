  "raw_comment": "What do you notice? I noticed that there are not that many head coaches of color.\nWhat do you wonder? I wonder if they are being discriminated against because of their color or it’s just coincidence. But there's also way more people of color that are actually playing in the leagues I don't think everything has to do with race.\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?  None. I think if u work hard to get to where you are you can do anything doesn’t matter what race you are and if it does now days then that is so stupid.\nWhat’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea. Why is it that more people of color are player in sports but head coaches are mostly  white people?",
