  "raw_comment": "1. What do you notice?\nI notice that the percentage of colored players is always greater than the percentage of head coaches of color. Also, that the WNBA and the NBA have the highest percentage of colored players out of all the sports (83%).\n\n2. What do you wonder?\nI wonder why there seems to be a lack of colored coaches in these sports in comparison to the number of colored players. \n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nWith the lack of diverse coaches in these sporting leagues, there is also a lack of coaches that minorities can look up to and relate to.\n\n4. What’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\nThis graph shows us the percentage of colored players and coaches in multiple sporting leagues. A catchy headline that would capture the graph's main idea is \"The Gap Between Players of Color and Coaches of Color\"",
