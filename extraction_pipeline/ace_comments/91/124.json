  "raw_comment": "CATCHY TITLE// Racial Diversity: Sideline Statistics \n\nlooking at these graphs I notice that there are higher percentages of players of color than there are coaches of color for every sport listed. I know that coaches stay in the league longer than players do and that there are more players than coaches. it just makes me wonder why POC don't get the representation that they deserve in higher positions, not just in sports but in any white-dominated industry. The impact that this could have on people in my community is devastating. I myself have watched sports my whole life and I used to dream of being a basketball coach in the WNBA. I never thought that I couldn't reach my goal because I always saw people who looked just like me doing it. Now I have come to realize that my fellow teammates, classmates, and friends had doubts as children because they never saw people who looked like them doing what they dreamed of, so they thought that they weren't allowed or that they didn't want people who looked like them to be in those positions. I can only imagine what it would feel like to have a dream but believe you couldn't reach it because of the skin color that you were born with. I think that these sats are a prime example of the argument that there should be more representation and equality in sports and positions of high regard.",
