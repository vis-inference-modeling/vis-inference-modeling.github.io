  "raw_comment": "I notice that the majority of coaches no matter the sport are Caucasian, but the majority of players are people of color except for major league baseball. The average percentage of players of color in these sports is 68% whereas the percentage of people of color who are coaches is 25.8%.\n\nI wonder why major league baseball is the only sport where the majority of players are Caucasian.\n\nI’m not sure how this impacts me personally since I don’t watch or play any sports. My community is mostly Caucasian so I feel that it doesn’t impact them much either.\n\nMy headline would be: “Diversity of Major Sports”",
