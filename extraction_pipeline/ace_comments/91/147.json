What do you notice?\nWe notice that the majority of players throughout the NFL, NBA, WNBA, MLS, and MLB are people of colour, whereas the majority of head coaches throughout these leagues are not people of colour. The NFL has the lowest percentage of head coaches of colour, and the MLS has the highest percentage of head coaches of colour.\n\n2. What do you wonder?\nWe wonder why the percentage of head coaches of colour is very low, especially in the MLB. Is it more difficult for a person of colour to be a head coach?\n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis demonstrates how racism is evident in the world of major league sports, and people of colour who want to be head coaches may not have the opportunities to in the future; \n\n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea\nThis graph uses bar graphs to depict the percentage of players of colour, versus the percentage of coaches of colour across multiple leagues, including the NFL, MBA, WNBA, MLB, and MLS, demonstrating how while many players are of colour, the percentage of coaches of colour is low.\n\n\"diversity in Major League Sports: the percentage of POC players and head coaches\"",
