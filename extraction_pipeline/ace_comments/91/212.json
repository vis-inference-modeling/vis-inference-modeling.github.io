I also notice that all of the professional sports teams have less than 50% head coaches of color.\nI wonder why there is such a significant difference between players of color and head coaches of color. \nThis impacts the types of players in my community that want to play professionally later in life. \nThese bar graphs show the diversity of each sport in comparison to the players and the head coaches. A name could be \"Diversity On the Court and Field.\"",
