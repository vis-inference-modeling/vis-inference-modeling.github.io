  "raw_comment": "I notice that the National Football league has the smallest percentage of head coaches of color compared to all the other graphs. I wonder why there aren’t many head coaches of color in sports. This impacts the poc community because people who want to coach a sports team will be discouraged by the graph and think that they won’t be able to coach any sport team. This graph shows the amount of players and head coaches who are of color. A headline for this graph would be ¨Are sports really diverse?¨.",
