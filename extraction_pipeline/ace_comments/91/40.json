  "raw_comment": "I noticed that both of the Basketball Associations have high percentages which means that people of color would have a better chance playing or coaching basketball. The NFL has also done a pretty good job at keeping their players diverse, however not as much for their coaches. The MLS has done a pretty decent job at keeping their players diverse at 60% as well as having the highest percentage for head coaches of color at 40%. On the other hand, the MLB has less than 50% of their players of color so they haven't done as well of a job at keeping their players diverse. I wonder why the MLS has a lower percentage than the NFL, WNBA, and the NBA for their players, yet have a higher percentage for the coaches. It's odd that their players/coaches ratio of color is somewhat proportionate but then the MLS has a different ratio than the rest. This doesn't really have an impact on me unless I wanted to play professionally in the WNBA, however I'm more interested in soccer (NWSL) which is the women's version of MLS who's data isn't in this data set. On the other hand, this probably impacts the community in a way that they would be more concerned for the MLB seeing that their percentages are lower than 50%. In the graph, the data shows the diversity of players and coaches within different sports leagues. As for the title/main idea of the data, I would name it \"Modern Professional Sports Leagues Diversities\".",
