  "raw_comment": "1. After looking over the graphs, I noticed that less than half of the coaches and managers are of color, compared to the players of color, holding a higher percentage.\n\n2. I wonder why there's a higher percentage of colored coaches than there are of players.\n\n3.  Just like players, kids also look up to coaches, and because of the lack of diverse coaches in these sports, there are fewer coaches that minorities can not only look up to but also relate to.\n\n4. The graph is showing the percentage of players, managers, and coaches of color in the N.F.L, W.N.B.A., N.B.A., M.L.B, and M.L.S.\nHeadline: \"The Gap Between Players of Color and Coaches of color.\"",
