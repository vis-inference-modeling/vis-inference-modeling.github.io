In baseball, most of the players don't identify as colored. \n\nWonder: I wonder why there aren't many people of color in higher levels of the sports industry. Maybe the non-colored coaches are more qualified? It could also be that they still don't hire people of color to hold high positions. \n\nImpact: This graph shows our generation that people of color are able to play sports with others that look like them, without being uncomfortable. But, the issue here is that we also don't see coaches of color- this is sending the message that people of color are not fit to be in higher positions. \n\nHeadline: Is it truly diverse? Analyzing sports norms in teams and coaches.",
