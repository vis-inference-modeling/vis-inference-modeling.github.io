  "raw_comment": "I notice that there are more players of color in major sports leagues than there are head coaches of color. The Women’s National Basketball Association and the National Basketball Association have the highest percentage of players of color at 83 percent. Major League Baseball has the lowest percentage of players of color at only 40 percent. The National Football League has the lowest percentage of head coaches of color, 13 percent, and Major League Soccer has the highest percentage of coaches of color at 41 percent. \nI wonder why there is a higher percentage of players of color than coaches of color in the five major league sports? Does this reflect the number of players on each sports team or the number of coaching positions? Why does the National Football League have such a high percentage of players of color but such a low coaches of color percentage?\nThese graphs demonstrate to me and my community that systemic racism and obstacles exist for people of color. It seems that more barriers prevent people of color from becoming coaching staff instead of players. I believe this reflects a systemic preference for non-people of color to obtain leadership positions, which needs to be abolished. \n\"Leadership Diversity Eludes Major League Sports\"",
