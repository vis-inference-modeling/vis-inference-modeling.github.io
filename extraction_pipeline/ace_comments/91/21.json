  "raw_comment": "What I noticed: I noticed that all the sports listed have more players of color compared to the head coaches of color. The head coaches of color percentages for all the sports range between 13%-41%, not even reaching 50%. To add, baseball is the only sport where colored players aren’t the majority. \n\nWhat I wonder: I wonder why the colored baseball players aren’t the majority when colored players in football, basketball, and soccer are the majority. What may have caused this? could it be because of how the sport is presented to the public?\n\nImpact on me and my community: Our community is impacted both positively and negatively by this graph. It impacts us positively because the diversity among the players can encourage other sports fans to play and shows that in some sports, colored people have the opportunity to be treated equally. It also impacts us negatively because the lack of diversity among the head coaches shows us how people of color might not have the opportunity to lead and could possibly reinforce the stereotypical job types present in society.\n\nMy title:  “Colored individuals aren’t getting equal opportunities on both sides of the major sports leagues, study says.”",
