Why is it that Caucasians are mostly coaching - why isn’t there diversity in the spectrum of sports? Is money and maybe racial bias to be honest the reason this is so? (Are African Americans gifted with sports, or are they Bid upon or played like puppets behind the scenes by the people that run everything which just so happen to be whites in power, in the sport industry.)\n\nThe impact goes heavily upon African Americans. Yes, if you aspire to iconic in sports or whatever then execute the process of achieving that dream! I just want you to know the real game, again behind the scenes, and if these racial statistics help prove my stance in that. This does not so much affect anyone else really - unless they are obsessed with sports, or believes that everything needs to generally be diverse.",
