  "raw_comment": "I notice the red percentage represents the players of color and the lighter red represents the head coaches of color. The percentages of the Women's National Basketball Association and National Basketball Association of players of color are the same. The number of players who are colored is less in MLP than the rest of the associations. I also noticed that the NBA and the WNBA have the highest percentage out of all of them. It seems that soccer is the least diverse sport.",
