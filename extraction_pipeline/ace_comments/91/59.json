  "raw_comment": "1. What do you notice?\nBased on the graphs displayed,I notice that there are far more players of color than head coaches of color in all the sports represented by graphs here. I also notice that both mens and women's basketball have an 83% rate of racial disparity which are the top sports with players of color. I also notice that major league soccer has a 41% head coach of color which is the highest of the represented sports. The National Football League has a 13% head coach of color rate. \n \n2. What do you wonder?\nI wonder what these graphs would have looked like in previous years to be able to compare then and now. I wonder how they choose which sports to graph. \n \n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nWe live in a predominantly white community with a majority of New Hampshire being white. Because of this we don’t see racism first hand but we are very much aware of it. \n\n4. What’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\n\"Racism on the Fields\"",
