  "raw_comment": "I notice that compared to players of color, there are far less head coaches of color. Especially in football where 74% of the NFL is made up of player of color and only 13% of the NFL head coaches are people of color.\n\nI wonder what percent of the staff on these major sports leagues such as assistant managers, coaches, nutritionist, etc. are people of color?\n\nThis impacts my community because for awhile now we've seen people of color excel at sports. However, it is just as important people of color have the opportunity to be coaching staff and be involved in more ways than just being players. If teams utilize people of color to play for their teams and win games, they should have just as much respect for people of color when it comes to hiring coaching staff.\n\nDiversity in major sports leagues off the field.",
