  "raw_comment": "I notice that football the sport with the least amount of coaches that are POC has more than 50 percent of the players being POC. I wonder if that makes it harder for for the players knowing that their coaches can´t relate to one of their biggest life challenges outside of the sport they play. This makes me question of the impact it might have on future coaches that are POC they must find this discourging knowing that although the athletes they will be coaching are like them their peers are not, leading them to have to face the challenges of being a pioneer in their profession. The diversty of the athletes in the sports should be the same or close to the same amount as those leading the athletes.",
