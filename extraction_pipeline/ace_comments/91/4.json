Also that the peak of amount of Head coaches of color is in 2020 for the Major League Soccer.\nWhat do you wonder?\nWhat is the data regarding this in 2021 so far? \nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nIt shows the diversity in our national sports teams. And should make us wonder why is there less Head coaches of color than players?\nWhat’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\nDoes the Sport determine the diversity of a team and coach?",
