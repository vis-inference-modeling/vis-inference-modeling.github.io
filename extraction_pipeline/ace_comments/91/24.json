  "raw_comment": "What do you notice? I notice that all of the head coaches in the sports listed are below 50%. Another thing to point out is that players have a much more diverse number. Most players of the sports listed are above 50%. Excluding MLB which is 40%.\n\nWhat do you wonder? I wonder why the percentage of players of color is so high but the percentage of coaches are significantly lower. Why does this disparity occur? Another interesting occurrence is that in all sports but MLS, the percentage of colored players is twice the amount of the percentage of colored coaches. Why does MLS stick out in that respect?\n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?  This affects those of color who aspire to be coaches of these major sports leagues. A possible explanation is racial prejudice. As coaches are in a state of greater power and responsibility over a team, which represents their community. This, unfortunately, gives those of color an extremely hard journey to become a coach compared to other races.  This should not be the case and this graph clearly points this fact out. This is a probable reason for the disparity of race.\n\nWhat’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea. The graph shows the disparity for players of color compared to head coaches of color. \nHeadline: Racial disparity in sports, diversity for players, the opposite for coaches, why is this the case?",
