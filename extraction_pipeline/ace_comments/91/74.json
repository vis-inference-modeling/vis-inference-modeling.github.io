  "raw_comment": "I notice that overall, there seems to be more players of color than white players, but more white coaches than coaches of color. I also notice that for both mens and womens basketball, the percentage of players of color is the highest of all five sports leagues, while baseball has the least number of players of color by about 43%. I wonder why there are so many more players of color compared to non colored players, but the opposite for coaches. I feel like the ratios should be closer to each other, because then it would keep the same percentage of colored people in these five sports leagues.\n\tThe effect this has on my community is that these graphs show how much of an outlier we are. From my experience playing sports my whole life, I have noticed that there are a lot more white players than players of color, and the same for coaches. This fact must arise because of how many white people, and people of color live in our community. If there were more people of color living in our community, we would see more players of color. But since our community is heavily white, the number of white players outnumbers that of the colored players.\n\tI would title the name of these graphs, “Racial Diversity in Professional Sports”",
