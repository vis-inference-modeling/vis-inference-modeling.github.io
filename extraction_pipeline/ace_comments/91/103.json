  "raw_comment": "I noticed that the NFL has the largest percent difference between head coaches of color and players of color (61%). The MLS has the smallest percent difference (19%). The NFL only has 13% of coaches of color. On the other hand, the WBNA and NBA have 83% of coaches as people of color. Although the MLB only has a 20% gap between coaches of color and players of color, they only have 20% of coaches as minorities and 40% of players as minorities. The percent of colored players is the least out of all the leagues. I also noticed that the data for the WBNA was taken from 2019 whereas the rest of was taken in 2020. \n\nI wonder how these percentages compare to say a decade ago. Did the percent difference between coaches of color and players of color grow or shrink? I also wonder how they would compare a decade into the future. Would the numbers drastically change or stay relatively the same? I'm also curious how diversity graphs would look internationally (i.e. European and Asian sports). Is this graph indicative of how people of color are treated in professional sports? \n\nThis impacts my community because while diversity has grown very much in sports, discrimination still takes place. While I think discrimination has lessened for players, I think it still poses challenges and obstacles for staff and personnel of color. Even though the US has made progress, there's still a long way to go. \n\nA headline could be, \"Diversity in Professional Sports: Staff vs. Players\".",
