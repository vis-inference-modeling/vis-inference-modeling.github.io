  "raw_comment": "1. What do you notice?\nI notice the red percentage represents the players of color and the lighter red represents the head coaches of color.\n2. What do you wonder?\nI wonder if this is just a local issue or is this the same problem all around the world?\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis tells me that there is a discrepancy between players of colors and coaches as there isn't someone the players can relate to/ look up to.\n\n4. What’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\nThere are more players of color than there are coaches which mean that there isn't much diversity in the sports. \nHeadline: There's no \"I\" in teams anymore",
