I also notice that all these graphs are information from 2020 while the Women's National basketball association is information from 2019. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nWhy is the amount of head coaches of color is so little?\n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community? \nRacism is a big and serious issue, and by looking at the graphs I can see that national sports aren't inclusive enough. People would much rather join a sport with people like them then one without.\n\nWhat's going on in this graph?\nLack of diversity in the field",
