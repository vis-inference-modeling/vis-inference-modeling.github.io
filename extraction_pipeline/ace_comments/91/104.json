  "raw_comment": "I noticed how the percent of colored players are higher than the percentage of colored coaches. I also noticed how the percentage of color varies per different sport. For example, the highest percentage of diversity is in the NBA (83%), and the lowest is the MLB (40%). I wonder why is is not consistent, and why there are more colored players than coaches. I understand how more players come and go then coaches, but it is still a question that lingers in my head. A catchy title would be “Diversity in the Game”.",
