  "raw_comment": "I notice that the Women’s basketball league says it is from 2019. \nI wonder why managers are shown in baseball instead of the colored head coaches. I noticed that the head coaches of color had the highest percentage in soccer. I wonder what the numbers would look like this year because of Covid. I notice that the percentages for colored coaching is the lowest in the football category. I wonder why there is not a bar graph for the Women’s Basketball League for the year of 2020. I notice that there is a higher number of players of color over the coaches in all categories. I wonder why there are more colored players rather than coaches.",
