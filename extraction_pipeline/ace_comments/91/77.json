  "raw_comment": "I noticed that for all five of the sports, there is a much higher percentage of players of color, than coaches of color. Male and female basketball has the highest percentage of players of color at 83%, but the percentage of coaches of color is still fairly low. The sport with the highest percent of colored coaches is Major League Soccer at 41%, which means that 59% of the rest of the coaches are white.\n \nI wonder if these percentages would be significantly different five or ten years ago, or in five or ten years ahead. I also wonder why the National Football League has such a high number of players of color, but the numbers for the coaches of color are so low. \n \nThis impacts my community and I for many reasons. Since Portsmouth lacks diversity, we don’t necessarily see as much racism as much as it exists around the country. As displayed in the graphs, there is clear evidence that there aren’t many professional sport coaches of color, as there are players. This tells us that there is some aspect of racism, and there needs to be changes regarding this. \n\n“The Lack of Diversity in Professional Sports”",
