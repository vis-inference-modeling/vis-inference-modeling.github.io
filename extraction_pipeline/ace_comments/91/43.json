  "raw_comment": "I notice that the women of color are at quite a high percentage, which means lots of women of color get a chance to be equal players and head coaches. The National Football League are also doing well in diversifying players, and the same for the National Basketball Association. However, the Major League Baseball is lacking a little more than the others in people of color, the percentage being less than 50. Major League Soccer is also slightly less than the others, but it stays above 50 as well. The Major League Soccer also has the highest percentage of head coaches who are people of color.\nI wonder why the Major League Baseball doesn't have as much as the others. I thought every sport would have at least 50% people of color. It seems that it needs a little more diversification, because it is lacking in people of color compared to the other leagues and associations.\nThis doesn't have much impact on me, but it probably has a slight impact on my community. I'm glad that there's a lot more diversification in sports. I'm South Asian so if anyone from there is interested in any of these sports, I know race wouldn't stop them. I'm glad there's a more positive impact on sports.\nThe graph shows the percentage of players of color and head coaches of color in different sports leagues and associations. The graph's main idea would be \"The Diversification in Different Sports Leagues and Associations\". That's what I would make the title and what captures the main idea of the graph.",
