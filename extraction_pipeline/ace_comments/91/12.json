  "raw_comment": "I noticed that in all of the sports except baseball, most of the players were of color. In all the sports leagues, the headcoaches were mostly non-colored. In all the leagues, the amount of colored players was at significantly more than the amount of colored headcoaches. \n\nI wonder why the percentage of colored players is much higher than the percentage of colored head coaches. I also wonder why the percentage of colored players in the MLB is quite lower than the rest of the leagues. Is baseball a sport that colored people don't play as much? Why are colored people not able to get as many spots as a head coach versus as a player?\n\nIt impacts my community positively, because it inspires me that there are so many colored people that are able to play sports proffesionaly. However, it also impacts me and my community negatively, because the graph also tells us that not many colored people are allowed to be a head coach. \n\nMy title is: \"Colored people are mostly the majority in players, but why not as head coaches?",
