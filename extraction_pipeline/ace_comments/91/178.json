  "raw_comment": "I notice that the majority of major sports leagues are made up of players of color, except for the major league baseball. I wonder why sports leagues have decided until recent years that they want to diversify team leadership? This impacts me and my community because as a person of color myself who lives in a city with most of the population as minorities you truly get to see how far we've gotten into allowing people of color into sports leagues. Though this doesn't mean we've accomplished increasing diversity it does allow young colored children the ability to hope and see themselves as a professional athlete. In this graph were able to see the percentages of players and dead coaches of color in some of the biggest major sports leagues. A headline for the graphs may be, \"How people of colored have diversified major sports leagues.\"",
