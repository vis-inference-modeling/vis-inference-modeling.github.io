  "raw_comment": "I notice that the percentage of head coaches stays under 50%, and are lower than those percentages of players of color with the lowest percentage being for the NFL.\n\nAssuming that the grey parts of the graphs represent the people that aren't of color, I wonder why their percentages are so low. If  there's a majority of players that are of color, why can't there be more coaches of color as well?\n\nThis impacts my community and I because it demonstrates how there is a lack of support for people of color. It shows how racism is still prevalent in society even in big leagues and associations.\n\nThese graphs demonstrate the percentages of players of color compared to head coaches of color.\n\nA catchy headline: \"Sports and graphs: Diverse, but only on the field.\"",
