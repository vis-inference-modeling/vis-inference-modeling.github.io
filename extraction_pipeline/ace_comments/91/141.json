  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\nIn every type of sports league depicted in the graph, there is a larger percentage of players who are people of color than there are head coaches who are people of color. Additionally, in most leagues except Major League Baseball, the percentage of players of color exceeds the percentage of head coaches of color by a large degree. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why there is such a large gap between players of color and head coaches of color? Why is the player of color:coach of color ratio so large? \n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nThroughout my schooling years, I have met two people of color who hoped to become coaches of popular sports teams. Will these peers of mine have trouble finding jobs in this industry because of the gap that occurs between players and head coaches of color? Discrimination still exists in our world whether it is purposeful or not. It continues to affect the people of color in my community and my country. The information in this graphic might be an example of this. \n\nHeadline:\nThe Roles People of Color Hold in Sports Leagues",
