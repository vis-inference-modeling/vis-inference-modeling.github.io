  "raw_comment": "I noticed that in all the leagues except the MLB, the majority of the players were colored. I also noticed that in all the leagues, colored people were less than 50% of the total head coaches.\n\nI wonder why MLB doesn't have a majority of colored people. I also wonder why colored people aren't the majority of head coaches in any of the leagues. \n\nThis graph impacts my community and I positively, because it tells us that majority of players in most leagues are colored, so there is no discrimination in sports. However, it also impacts us negatively, because the graph implicates that colored people aren't the majority of head coaches in any of the leagues. \n\nMy title for this graph is: \"Majority of non-colored head coaches in leagues, but a majority of colored players in most leagues, is there a reason?\"",
