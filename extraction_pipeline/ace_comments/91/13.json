I also notice that basketball has the highest percentage of players of color (83% for men and women) and soccer has the highest percentage coaches of color (41%).\n\nWonder: I wonder why basketball, both women's and men's, has the highest percentage of players of color compared to the other sports. Is it because of the basketball influence for people of color, or other reasons? I also wonder why football has such a low percentage of coaches of color at 13% despite having the second largest percentage of players of color, at 74%.\n\nImpact: These numbers impact me and my community in a largely positive way because it shows that many sports players are very diverse in major sports. However, it could also be concerning, because the coaching positions are not as diverse. In fact, not a single sport listed has over 50% coaches of color.\n\nCatchy Headline: Shocking Statistics Reveal Major Discrepancies in Diversity between Playing and Coaching Positions.",
