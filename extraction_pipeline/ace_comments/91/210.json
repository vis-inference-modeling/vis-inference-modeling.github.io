I wondered compared to other sports is basketball still a popularly played sports game. The impacts that this graph has on the community is the number of players who are playing basketball and the number of people who play basketball as a real paying job.  The graph is showing several different types of basketball players who are involved in major sports leagues. A catchy headline can be players who play major sports league in basketball.",
