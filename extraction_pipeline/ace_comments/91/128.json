  "raw_comment": "I noticed that there are many more players of color than coaches of color. The length of time that a player can play is much shorter than a coaching time. Players age out of the sport, but coaches can remain in a coaching position for many years.  I wonder what the average time a coach stays with their team. This plays a big impact on our community because it shows how much our country has changed. It's weird to think that years ago people of color were separated from just using the same bathroom as white people. And now there is a big mix of different ethnicities on our national sports teams. One of the greatest baseball players, Hank Aaron, was not allowed to play with a white team until 1953. He still faced discrimination after that. This shows how much our country has grown and changed. I also wonder how hard it is to get on one of the competitive teams with your race. Many sports teams want to create diversity, so they want different races on their team. This also reminds me of colleges, many colleges look to enroll people of a different race than what the average is at that certain college.",
