  "raw_comment": "1. What do you notice?\nI noticed that more than 50% of the players in each major sports league, except for Major League Baseball, are people of color. I also noticed that the percentage of coaches of color for each major sports league was much lower than 50%.\n \n2. What do you wonder?\nI wonder why there are so few coaches of color in each major sports league. Is there something preventing more coaches of color from earning these positions? I also wonder why less than 50% of Major League Baseball is composed of players of color. I wonder how all of these percentages would compare to data from 20 years ago.\n \n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis impacts me and my community because people of color in my community who aspire to coach these leagues may not have the opportunity to, due to their race. To me, this is appalling because someone should never have a lesser opportunity because of their race. This has obviously been an ongoing issue in our world that needs to come to an end. \n \n4. What’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\nThis graph clearly shows that there are many less coaches than players of color in these major sports leagues. The graph depicts the lack of coaches of color in these leagues.\nHeadline: “Racism In The Game.”",
