  "raw_comment": "I noticed that in all the leagues except the MLB colored people were the majority of the players. I also noticed that in all the leagues, non colored people were the minority. \n\nI wonder why the percentage of colored head coaches for all the leagues are under 50%. I also wonder why baseball is the only league shown that doesn't have a colored people majority in players.\n\nThis graph impacts my community positively, because it tells us that majority of the players in most leagues are colored people. However, it also impacts me and my community negatively, because it is shown in all the leagues that colored people aren't the majority, or are a low percentage of the total head coaches. This shows that colored people are mainly the players, and not as many colored people are able to be head coaches.\n\nMy title for this graph is: \"Are most  colored people subjective to being players, and not head coaches in leagues?\"",
