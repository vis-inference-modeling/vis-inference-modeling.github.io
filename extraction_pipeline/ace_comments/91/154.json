This made us wonder why this gap in player and coaching representation exists. We also noticed that soccer and baseball have the lowest percentage of colored players. On the other side of it, Major League Soccer has the highest percentage of head coaches of color. Another thing we noticed was that all of the data is from 2020 except for one group, the Women’s National Basketball Association which is from 2019. This makes you curious as to why they would include data from a different year only for one of the groups. This also made us wonder why they would only show one women's sport out of the 5 sports showcased. Lastly, we noticed that for the MLB, managers were counted as head coaches instead of the actual coaches being counted. This made us wonder why they would have to count managers and not head coaches like they did for every other sport. From our observations and wonderings, we thought of the data’s impact on our community. For one, it makes it clear that to our community that there is a major problem with underrepresented coaches of color in professional sports. From that it makes us question what we as a community can do to lessen this issue.",
