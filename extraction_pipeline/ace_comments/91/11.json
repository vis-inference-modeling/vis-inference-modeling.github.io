  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\nI noticed that all of the categories had more players of color compared to head coaches of color.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why there are more players of color compared to head coaches of color. It could be that there are more players of color compared to coaches in the industry in general. \nI also wonder why the percentage of head coaches of color in Major League Baseball is majorly lower than the other three. Is it because of the sport itself or the association? \n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nIt shows the increase in diversity over the years and likely influences and encourages more diversity in schools, communities, and workforces. \n\nWrite a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\n\"Diversity in professional sports: high or low?\"",
