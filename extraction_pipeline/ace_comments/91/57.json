  "raw_comment": "1. What do you notice?\nI notice that there is a larger proportion of POC(people of color) that are players compared to the proportion of POC that are coaches\n \n2. What do you wonder?\nI wonder why there are more POC that are players than POC that are coaches, and will there be changes to these statistics in the future. I also wonder why other huge sports leagues weren’t included in these statistics such as the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) or the National Hockey League, I think they would’ve made a good addition to either contrast or reinforce the already included data.\n \n \n \n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nI think this has an impact on me and my community in the sense that my community and I do watch sports and that my community like many others is impacted by current racial issues such as instances of societal discrimination, and I think that the statistics we see could be caused by societal dsicrimination in the sense that Colored people may be discriminated against when trying to find higher positioned jobs in sports such as coaching.\n \n4. What’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\nThe graph is showing the contrast of the percentage of POC within coaching and playing positions.\nA catchy headline could be: “Why aren’t POC getting an equal amount of play on both ‘sides’ of the game?”",
