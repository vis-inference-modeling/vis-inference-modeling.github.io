  "raw_comment": "I notice that for about every three players of color, there’s only one person of color who is a head coach or manager. I wonder whether each team has a similar proportion of players of color or if some have close to all and some have close to none. (Although a large majority of players are people of color either way). This impacts me and my community because of the biases and expectations that come with these kinds of patterns. In the example of sports teams and coaches/managers, there are many more white people in power even though people of color are the reason they are successful. This may keep people of color from those leadership positions in the future if change isn’t actively sought. \n\nA possible headline: People of Color are the Driving Force of Major League Sports Teams… But Who’s in Charge?: Racial Disparity in Sports",
