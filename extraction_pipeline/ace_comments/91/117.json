  "raw_comment": "Part 2\n \n What do you wonder? I wonder what the term “colored” is referring to. Does this refer to everyone who is non-caucasian or does this refer to only African Americans? I am curious about this because I wonder if the numbers would change, especially in the MLS since it is more popular in Europe and South America than in the United States. Does this also lead to the fact that since soccer is not among the top three most popular sports in the U.S. and the understanding that many players are not from America, is the reason why the numbers are more equal among people of color and non-color in both players and coaches?  \n \nI also wonder why the data for the WNBA is from 2019 and not 2020 like the rest of the data. Is this not as accurate because of the Coronavirus?",
