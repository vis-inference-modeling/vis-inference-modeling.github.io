  "raw_comment": "I immediately noticed that in football and basketball most players are people of color with around 80% of players being people of color while in baseball and soccer it is more equal staying at 40% and 60%. However, another thing that is noticeable in all sports is that the head coaches are mostly not people of color. This makes me wonder why there are a lot of people of color as player but not many as coaches. Our community is impacted by this as it shows that at least in some sports people of color have an equal opportunity to succeed as players. I would name the article \"How Diverse are Major League Sports?\"",
