  "raw_comment": "Notice: I definitely notice a strong absence of head coaches that are POC. Unsurprising really that there is almost always going to be at least double the number of POC players than head coaches.\n\nWonder: I wonder how big their sample size is and what the numbers really are. I also wonder what each association plans on doing to change this because it really should be more correlated. \n\nThis may not have a great impact on my immediate community, but I am from Iowa so a couple of our college teams are kinda good I guess. It mainly has an impact on the players of color who I feel for because they are more than likely to not see a coach who is also POC during their career (throughout college athletics and throughout their career if they choose that path). \n\nPossible Headline: Broken Promises: National Athletics Associations Refuse To Level With Their Commitments to Racial Equity.",
