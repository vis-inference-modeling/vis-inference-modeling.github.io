  "raw_comment": "As I look at this graph, I notice that in every major league sport, the percentage of players of color is higher than the percentage of head coaches of color. I can’t help but wonder if this is because of the smaller sample size of the head coaches.\n\nIn the MLB’s case, there are only 30 managers total, one for each team. Each team has, at most, a 40-player expanded roster. With 30 teams in the league, there can be a maximum of 1,200 players that play for the MLB at once. The difference between the minuscule amount of managers and the much larger number of players makes me wonder how much the sample size comes into play. If each team had a 1:1 manager/player ratio, would the percentage of head coaches of color still only be 20 percent?\n\nThe issue of the small sample size also is relevant in each one of the other sports. The NFL has the highest number of head coaches, at 32. The NFL has more than 1,500 active players every year, which gives a much higher opportunity for diversity than the mere 32 coaches. When it comes down to it, I think the reason the percentages of diversity are much lower in coaches is because of availability. The average NFL player’s career only lasts 3.3 seasons, whereas the average NFL head coach’s career is nearly a full year longer, averaging out at 4.3 seasons. To me, the long career, as well as the limited availability, are very large factors in whether or not a position is diverse or not, because the positions are not being filled as quickly.",
