Furthermore, I can observe that the only women sport listed is the WNBA. The MLS is the closest in percentage between Players of color and Head Coach of Color and the WNBA and the NBA have an equal percent of players of color; there is 5% more Head Coach of Color in the NBA than the WNBA.\n\n2. I wonder why are only managers shown for the MLB? How players are recruited into the WNBA and NBA? What is the criteria for being a head coach? Why are there less Head coaches of color than players? Finally, I wonder why MLB and MLS contain fewer players of color?\n\n3.  Some possible impacts in my community is that the job market for head coaches of color is limited. Furthermore, in my community, Students are interested in being football players which means that there are more students of color with the ability to make their dreams come true. \n \n4.
