Soccer has the closest percent of coaches and players of color, however, they have fewer players of color compared to Basketball or Football.  \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder how this lack of people of color in leadership positions affect the player of color? \n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nI live in New England, where the New England Patriots have a head coach who is white, but the Red Sox have a coach who is a person of color. \n\nWhat’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\n\"Leadership lacks Diversity\"",
