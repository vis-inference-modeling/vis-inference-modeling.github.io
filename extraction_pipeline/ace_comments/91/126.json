  "raw_comment": "What do I notice? I notice that there are many more white coaches than black coaches. There is a problem with these graphs though. I can see they're trying to say that racism is still around, but this is actually pretty proportional to America. About 70% of America is made of people not of color. There's obviously going to be more non-people of color. It's silly to not think so.\n\nI wonder why the NHL was excluded from this. The NHL has very few black players at the moment, around 43, since 2020. A typical NHL roster consists of 20 players, which is about 620 players. And only 43 of them are black. There are currently NO black head coaches in the NHL. You can argue racism on this, which is partially true,\n\nRecently there have been more and more NHL coaches being fired from their position due to racist accusations, and them turning out to be true. I'd like to see the NHL in here, so people could question, why does the NHL have so few POC players?",
