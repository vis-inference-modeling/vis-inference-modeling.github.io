  "raw_comment": "Diversity in Pro Sports\nThis graph shows the number of players that are people of color on various sports teams based on the percentage of players on the team, while also showing the number of people of color that are in charge of coaching these teams. As a group, we noticed that people of color make up a very high percentage of these sports teams, despite making up a very small amount of the coaches and managers. Our group is curious about a few things in this graph. For one; which group makes up the gray portion of each bar? We also want to know why there is a noticeable lack of players of color within the MLB. The data collection process also makes us wonder, what specific teams were involved, who gathered the data? Though arguably most importantly, we wonder about the paycheck difference between coaches and players. We want to know what are some consequences of having so few people of color acting as coaches.",
