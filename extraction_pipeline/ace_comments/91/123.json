  "raw_comment": "In looking at this graph, I notice how players of color make up way over 50% besides baseball in major sports leagues. Because of this, I wonder why the number of head coaches of color are substantially lower than number of players. Is this lower number because of race or is it just that way because? This impacts my community because if coaches are mostly white because of race, that will seriously damage our country. Every person in America deserves a chance to pursue whatever career or dream they wish without race playing a role. \nNew Headline: \"Does Race Play a Role In Sports Teams?\"",
