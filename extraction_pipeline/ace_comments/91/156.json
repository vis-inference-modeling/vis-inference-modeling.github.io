  "raw_comment": "Summary:\n \nIt is a graph showing the percentage of players and coaches with color in some sports. Based on the sports and the names of the sports associations, we can assume that these are sports associations that are based in the United States.  We’ve noticed that most of the sports have a vast majority of colored players, while most of the coaches are white. Colored athletes in basketball are well represented compared to other sports. However, coaching has a much lower percentage of minorities. We wonder why the head coaches are less likely to be people of color because for each sport the percentage of color for coaches is lower than players? We also wonder why soccer has such a high percentage of coaches of color compared to the other sports, could it be because it is more widely played in other parts of the world so there’s a wider variety of coaches? This data may impact our community because it is discouraging coaches of color to pursue a coaching position on more diverse teams. However, this could influence minorities or people of color to join sports, where everybody is included. You can become a professional player of any sport no matter your skin color. \n \nOur catchy headline for this graph is “The divide in diversity: the gap between diverse athletes and coaches”",
