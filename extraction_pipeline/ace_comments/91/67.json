  "raw_comment": "What do you notice? The percentage of players of color in major sports leagues is very high. 83% of the Women's National Basketball Association's and National Basketball Association's players are people of color while 74% of players in the National Football League are people of color. This is significantly high compare to other career fields. The Head coaches percentage, however, is totally different. The majority of percentage of head coaches of color range from 13% to 30%, very low considering how people of color are everyone who is not white. The percentage of Major League Soccer is both surprising and reasonable for me. The percentage is definitely more balance when it comes to players and head coaches. This probably can be explained by the large number of countries playing soccer in the world\n\nWhat do you wonder? Why the percentage of head coaches of color is significantly less than players of color.\n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community? Looking at the percentage of head coaches who are people of color, I can see how much work needed to be done. There should be more opportunities being provided to the people of color to coach and to lead in major sports leagues\n\nHeadline: Percentage of people of color in major sports leagues - A huge milestone or still no improvement?",
