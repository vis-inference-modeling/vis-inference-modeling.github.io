There is a drastic difference between the 2 percentages and this needs to change. The Women's national Basketball Association and the National Basketball Association has the 83% of players of color which is the highest out of all shows teams. The lowest percentage of POC as coaches is 13% in the NFL.\n2. What do you wonder?\nI wonder why there is such a low percentage of Head coaches of color?\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis impacts me and my community because racism is clearly still a part of the major sports leagues. POC won't get the same opportunities as white people in regards to being head coach of teams  in the major sports leagues.\n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\nThe graphs is showing data regarding percentages of Player of color in Major sports leagues and Head coaches of color. A catchy headline would be \"Lack of Diversity in Sports\"",
