  "raw_comment": "I notice that in all of these major sports leagues, the majority of players are players of color. However, there are fewer coaches of color in these sports leagues. I wonder what causes leagues that have many players of color to have few coaches of color. The impact this has on me is that I am of color and it shows the different statistics and opportunities for people of color, like me. This impacts the community by displaying the diversity among members of sports leagues. In this graph, a common trend is that in all of the listed sports leagues, the ratio of players of color to coaches of color is, on average, around 4:1. The graph is trying to indicate the differences in race and diversity among modern sports leagues.",
