  "raw_comment": "1. What do you notice?\n\ni noticed that in all of the five sprots there is a higher percentage of colored players than colored coaches. In NBA 83 percent of their players are people of color but only 30 percent of their coaches are people of color. And the same goes for the WNBA, 83 percent of their players are people of color and only 25 percent of their coaches are people of color.\n\n2. What do you wonder?\n\nI wonder how much the percentage of people of color playing the these different sports would change in  about 5-10 years.\n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\n\nThis impacts my comunity alot because the graphs show that not alot of people of color are given the oppotunity to work in the sports field as coaches. \n\n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\n\nThis graph is showing the difference between the percentage of the colored players and the percentage of colored head coaches in the major league sports.  A catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea would be \"Is there equality in professional sports?\"",
