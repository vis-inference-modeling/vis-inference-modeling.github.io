I have also noticed that there is a greater amount of players of color than head coaches. \n \nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder, how do the percentages have a huge difference\nCan this data be applied internationally? \nHow are these scores compared to other sports, like tennis or track? \n \nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis impacts the community, as there is a lack of diversity when it comes to the coaches. Looking at the statistics, there are already many people of color who are players but not a lot when it comes to being coaches. Since there are little head coaches of color, it could make kids discouraged to achieve their dreams of becoming a head coach for these sports. \n\nWhat’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\nStatistics show the truth of the diversity in these Major League sports.",
