  "raw_comment": "1. What do you notice?\n \nI notice that in sports like basketball and football, African-American players dominate the sport. Soccer and baseball however, are much closer to the 50% mark. Also, I noticed that none of the five sports had over 50% of minority head coaches/managers. \n \n2. What do you wonder?\n \nI wonder, will there ever come a time where one of those sports eclipses the 50% of minority head coaches/managers mark?\n \n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\n \nI am somebody who eats, breathes, and sleeps sports. I’m also someone who is passionate about racial issues and equality. I think it is absolutely disgusting how minorities are and have been treated in this country. These graphs just show another example of racial inequality.\n \n4. What’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\n \nSports Need A Color-Blindness Test",
