  "raw_comment": "I notice that in all of the leagues listed but baseball, over 60% of all players are players of color. However, no league has a majority of coaches that are people of color.\n\nI wonder if the reason that there are so few coaches of color is because of racism. Racism has a long and ugly history in this country, and it would not surprise me if coaches of color were not being hired due to this.\n\nThis has a negative impact on the greater community. because while people of color will see other people of color succeeding in sports, they will not see similar idols they can look up to in the head coaching department. If people cannot relate to idols that they can look up to, they will be less likely to want to be head coaches.\n\nMy title: \"Coaches of Color Are Hired at Far Lower Rates than White Coaches\"",
