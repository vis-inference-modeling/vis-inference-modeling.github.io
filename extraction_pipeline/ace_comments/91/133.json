  "raw_comment": "What I noticed: I noticed that there is much more diversity in the player role then there is in the coaching role. Many of the sports have at least two times the percent of players of color then coaches of color, the one exception being the M.L.S. One other thing I noticed is that there are far less colored players in the M.L.B. \n\nWhat I wonder: I wonder why companies or sports corporations have not been giving out more jobs to colored people in the coaching position. With many of the players in sports now being colored I think a colored coach may end up being able to work with them better. I also wonder why there is such a lack of diversity in the M.L.B. Something just seems off when you look at all the other sports diversity compared to the M.L.B’s. \n\nImpact: This statistics show the truth about professional careers in sports being both a player and a coach. It makes me think that it must be a lot harder to be good at basketball if you are white then if you are colored. Seeing these statistics may call others to try and do something about the lack of diversity in coaching or leadership roles. I thought many sports organizations have said that they try to add diversity but this shows that they are not doing so in any leadership roles.\n\nTitle:  Lack of diversity for leadership roles. Something needs to change.\n\nI had written more but I could not fit it all in the allotted space.",
