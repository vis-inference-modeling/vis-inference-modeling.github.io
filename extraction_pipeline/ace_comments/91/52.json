  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\nI noticed that this graph displays the racial disparity in different major sport leagues; showing the players of color in red and head coaches of color in pink. One of the graphs shows the women's national basketball association while the other ones just show the national sports associations which are men. \nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why they chose to incorporate only the women's national basketball association. I also wonder why there are more players of color rather than coaches. \nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis impacts my community in knowing that maybe there should be more diverse coaches in the national teams across the country in order for players and aspiring players of color to have someone they can see themselves in to look up to.\nWhat’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\nA headline for this graph could be \"Players vs Coaches of Color in Major League Sports\"",
