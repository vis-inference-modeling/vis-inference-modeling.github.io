I wonder what other sports could you have represented in this graph, and why did they choose just these sports? This affects my community by encouraging more kids  to to look up to all of these individuals in these sports and encourage themselves to be like these people. If I were the maker of this graph I would title it, Diversity in Major Sports Leagues.",
