  "raw_comment": "Based on the data provided in the graph, we found that despite a majority of sports having large percentages of players of color, there are far less coaches of color to represent them. As an example, the National Football League consists of 74% players of color, however, has only 13% coaches of color serving in the league. We also noticed that Major League Baseball tends to have the fewest players of color in comparison to other sports featured in the graph. These findings led us to question, why do the percentages of players of color seemingly have little correlation to the amount of coaches of color? Furthermore, the information presented in the graph affects both ourselves and our community in several ways. Underrepresentation in sports can have a major effect on young people of color who hope to pursue a career in professional sports and potentially hurt their aspirations. Our group also believed it was important for players and coaches to be able to have people around them who are different and have experienced different things in order for them to grow and be able to create relationships. Our headline for this article would be : “Major league sports in relation to coaches and players of color.\"",
