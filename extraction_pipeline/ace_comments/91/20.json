I wonder why Major League Baseball has significantly less players of color than any of the other leagues listed here.\n\n3. My community and I are affected by this because it shows that while people of color can become sports players, it is unlikely for people of color to have a management/coaching position in these sports. This thus results in less people of color wanting to be in a coaching position and will keep this data relatively static.\n\n4. This graph is showing the amount of people of color as players/athletes and the amount of head coaches of color. A catchy name for this might be \"Are major sports leagues actually diverse?\"\n\n4.",
