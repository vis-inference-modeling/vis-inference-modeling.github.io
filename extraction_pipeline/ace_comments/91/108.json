How can we tell more people of color to be involved and equal out this statistic? \n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis really just makes a lot of people get many different views on people of color, such as them being lazy or unauthentic because of the lack of involvement. It could also represent that people of color don't have enough knowledge to be involved in sports. \n\nWhat’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\n\"How has the involvement from people of color evolved through the year 2020?\"",
