I also notice that the football league has the lowest percentage of colored coaches. I notice that some sports have mixed percentages.\n\nI wonder if maybe the football league has other restrictions on some things and maybe that why that they don't have many colored coaches, I also wonder if this is around the world or somewhere certain. I also wonder why jobs are not being offered to more colored people for coaching positons",
