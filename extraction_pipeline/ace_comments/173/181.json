  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\nThe very first thing I noticed while looking at the graph is how much more likely legacy students are to be admitted into college. There is a significant trend indicating how legacy students are far more likely to be admitted into ivy league colleges. The second thing I noticed is how rich-non legacy kids are less likely to be admitted compared to poor-non legacy students. The third thing I notice is how the percentage of rich-legacy students have the biggest advantage in getting into the Ivy League.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why the admission officials care so much about legacy. Does it increase profit? I also wonder why more wealthy kids who have no legacy have less of a chance of being admitted into college. \n\nHow does this affect me and my community?\nMy classmates and I are going to be starting the college process very shortly and knowing the chances with legacy and whatnot can be a huge factor. It makes many students ask the question- “do I have less of a chance of getting into a college because I have no legacy and no wealth”? It seems to create an unfair advantage to me and my community which is very concerning to some.\n\nHeadline\nWealth and legacy- is this mainly what admissions care about?",
