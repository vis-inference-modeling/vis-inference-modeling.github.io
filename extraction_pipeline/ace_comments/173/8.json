  "raw_comment": "When observing the graph of college admissions, you can see that kids with a legacy boost are at a much more significant advantage compared to kids who do not have a legacy. \nWe can also see that even kids with the highest income level are at an enormous disadvantage compared to kids with a higher income and a legacy boost. \nThis is disheartening because as a high achieving and striving student who wants to attend an Ivy League just because I don't have a legacy, I am already behind before applying. It also makes me even more upset for the students already at an economic disadvantage because even if they are much better academically than another student with a legacy, the lesser student is more likely to be accepted because of the school's predisposed preference.",
