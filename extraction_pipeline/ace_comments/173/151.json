  "raw_comment": "I see that wealthy applicants have a better probability of being admitted to one of the many prestigious institutions. According to the graph, the poorest have around a 3x higher probability above the average admittance rate, whilst the richest have roughly a 7x chance of being admitted. \nIs wealth a more important influence on admission than real test scores or results?\nThis applies to my neighborhood because the average poverty percentage in my city is 19.69%, and someone involved in an elite college has a lower probability of being accepted than the wealthier\ncollege admissions; assets or effort",
