  "raw_comment": "What do you notice? A: I noticed that if you have a lot of money or a legacy boost, then you are more likely to get into that college. But, if you don't have a lot of money or none of your relatives had been in that college, you're a lot less likely to get into that school.\nWhat do you wonder? A: I wonder if those people with good money bribe or give a lot of money to these schools so that their children will get into a good school. Or if you have a higher income you will have a higher chance of getting in. \nHow does this relate to you and your community? A: I'm sure some people here want to get into these schools but not a lot of us have good money, and I would say that I am in the middle class. It would be harder for me or someone else to get into that school without a lot of money. \nElite Colleges, and Advantage Legacys",
