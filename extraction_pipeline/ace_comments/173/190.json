  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\nWhen it comes to comparing students with the same test scores and figuring out who to admit to an elite college, legacy applicants have a much better chance of getting admitted. But, when money is added to the picture, non-legacy applicants that come from poorer families have a higher chance of being admitted than wealthy non-legacy applicants.\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why the colleges pay attention to the students' background and income more than their test scores. If a non-legacy student had a higher test score than a legacy student would it convince the colleges to admit them over the legacy student?\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to me because I am currently in high school and I will start preparing for college some time next year, and if I'm not a legacy student, or a poor non-legacy student, but I still get good test scores, will I have a good chance of getting admitted?\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\n\"Dear my future College, am I good enough for you?\"",
