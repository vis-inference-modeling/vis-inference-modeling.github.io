The gap is pretty constant, however further in the higher percentile. legacy students have a greater admission rate.\n\nI wonder if students and parents will recognize this problem and start to do something about it. I also wonder if affirmative action had anything to do with the outcome of the graph. It would also be interesting to see which colleges were surveyed.\n\nThis relates to me because I am approaching college admissions shortly, and gives me more information about the statistics behind the application process.\n\nDecoding the Numbers: Does income affect admittance?",
