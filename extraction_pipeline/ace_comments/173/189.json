  "raw_comment": "1) What do you notice? \nI noticed that students with parents that had a very high income rank had 7 times more of a chance to be admitted into elite colleges than those with parents that had low income ranks. \n2) What do you wonder?\nI wonder if any background factors of these students' parents' jobs play a part in their admission as well. Does it matter what kind of job they have? \n3) How does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to me and my community because as a high schooler, we are preparing to enter college and pursue a career meaning people my age or older have to take in consideration of these details, we must be aware of our possibilities and take advantage of what we can. \n4) What’s going on in this graph?\nThe Rich Take Over College Too?",
