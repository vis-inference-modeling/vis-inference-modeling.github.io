I also noticed that there was a huge jump for that 0.1% of legacy and non-legacy applicants.\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder how many people fall within the range of 75% to 93%. Additionally, I wonder what would happen if the graph were on a different scale, like the log scale. \nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nOne thing I wonder is what percentile does my community fall under. I believe my community is wealthier, and believe my community falls in the 90% range. \nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\n\n\"Legacy Vs. Admissions. A Battle Incoming College Students have to Face!\"",
