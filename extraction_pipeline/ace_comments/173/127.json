  "raw_comment": "Welcome to Wednesday's live moderation of “What’s Going On in This Graph?”  Today’s graph is about college admissions for the twelve most selective colleges in the United States.  For these colleges, how does having a relative that attended the college you are applying to and your parents’ income relate to the chances of your being admitted?\n\nFrom 9 am – 2 pm E.T. today, share with us your responses online for the four questions.  If your notice includes a claim, please back it up with evidence that supports your claim.  By Friday morning, we’ll reveal the free link to the online article that included these graphs, shout outs for some of the  catchiest headlines and more.  \n\nYou can get a link to your response to share with your teacher and classmates by clicking the response box below your response “Email me when my comment is published.”  \n\nThe next graph will be released by Friday, February 2 with live moderation on Wednesday, February 7.  The topic – 2023 global temperatures.",
