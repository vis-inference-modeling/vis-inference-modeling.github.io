  "raw_comment": "This graph is highly relatable to my experience right now as a high school senior. It shows the advantage that legacy students have at Ivy League schools. You can tell from the graph that having a parent attend that college raises the applicant's chances significantly, but interestingly, it most affects the rich. This is most likely because wealthy people tend to donate to their alma mater, especially when they have a child hoping to attend that school.  This shows how the college selection process has become increasingly biased and no longer based on the student and their accomplishment. Money makes the world go around, and colleges are businesses, so income is their main focus. The more wealthy can provide this, especially when their multigenerational legacies and alumni of these institutions. I would title this graph: \"College Admissions: Money Talks.\"",
