  "raw_comment": "I notice how legacy applicants with parents of higher income have a much higher chance of being accepted than that of someone \"poorer\" or a regular applicant. I wonder why it is more important to accept those whose parents have attended. Children aren't always the same as their parents. So why is there such a high chance for these higher income legacy applicants when there isn't a guarantee that they'll be similar. These legacy applicants could even be less academic than their parents. People who aren't legacy applicants though, such as myself, would have no where near as good of a shot without being a legacy applicant. This relates to me because as a Junior, I need to start looking for colleges. Not being a legacy applicant will affect my options greatly. A catchy headline for this could be: Status over Smarts?: Is being a legacy applicant more important than being academically smart?",
