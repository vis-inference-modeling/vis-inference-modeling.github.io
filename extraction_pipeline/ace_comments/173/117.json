  "raw_comment": "The graph shows the likelihood of legacy applicants to be admitted into elite colleges, in comparison to those with the same qualifications without legacy advantage. In the graph we can see a student in the top one percent is over 7 times more likely to be accepted to a school. Additionally students from wealthy parents are most likely to have parents who are legacy. I wonder how colleges are still able to accept students based on their finical status rather than Merit. I wonder with the overturning of affirmative action if this will be the next thing to go in the college admission process. This graph impacts my community because I am a student applying to college and it shows how people my own age may have a greater chance of getting into called solely based on wealth and legacy as compared to me a first generation student. \n\n “ The corruption among the elites”",
