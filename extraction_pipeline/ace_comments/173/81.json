  "raw_comment": "In this graph, it is measuring the relation between parents’ income, legacy status, and admissions status at the collegiate level. I noticed that, generally, richer applicants had a greater estimated legacy boost than those who were poorer. For example, as the parents’ income rank became closer and closer to 100th, the estimated legacy boost became closer and closer to 7x. Whereas, on the other hand, poorer applicants closer to an income rank of 10th seemed to only have an estimated legacy boost of 2x. I wonder if the legacy boost is greater for applicants whose parents have a higher income rank because having a richer background increases the chances of multiple generations of family members being able to afford attending that college. Additionally, I noticed that the estimated advantage in admissions for those without legacy status on the richer end of the spectrum was lower than for those who were poorer and wonder why this is the case. I also wonder what criteria and processes a school uses to determine their legacy boost discrepancies and if this varies from college to college. This applies to my community because I recently went through the college process and the concept of legacy advantage has been a concern for many. It can be unfair as applicants can have very similar profiles to legacy applicants yet those with legacy are favored over them. My headline for this graph would be: “Is Bias Overcoming the College Admissions Process?”.",
