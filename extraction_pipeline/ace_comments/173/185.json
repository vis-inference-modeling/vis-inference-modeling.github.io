  "raw_comment": "Notice: I noticed that from 50th-70th, the without legacy applicants rate decreased but the legacy applicants increased. \n\nWonder: I wonder how this would vary from school to school. For example, Is one school much more likely to value legacy applicants than those without legacy status, or vice versa? \n\nRelation to Community: This relates to my community because as high school students, we need to be aware of data like this during our application processes so we know what our probabilities are and what odds may be stacked against or in favor of us. \n\nHeadline: “Legacy Privileges Unveiled. Are The Odds in Your Favor?”",
