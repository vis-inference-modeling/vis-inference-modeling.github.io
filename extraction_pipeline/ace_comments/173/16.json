  "raw_comment": "I noticed that for legacy applicants, they are 7x as likely to be admitted as opposed to applicants without legacy status, meaning that if an applicant had relatives with a history of attending a certain elite university such as Ivy Leagues, then they had a much higher chance of being accepted compared to an applicant who did not have any prior legacy status in their family. Also, the richer an applicant's parents' income rank was and the more upper class they were, the higher the chance they were to be admitted into an elite college, even under the scenario of students with the same test scores. \n\nI wonder why it's harder for applicants without legacy status to be admitted into the same university with the same scores as others who have family or are a apart of generations in their family that have a history of attending the elite college that they are currently applying too. While I do understand why generations of a family might wish to all attend the same prestigious school, I don't think it's fair to other applicants who work just as hard but are simply the first of their family to apply and wish to be admitted. However, I think that this current statistic very likely has to do with elite colleges wishing to keep their students \"elite\", and the fact that most legacy status applicants most likely come from wealthy families that are able to use connections and legacy history to their advantage. \n\nPt. 1- Questions 1 & 2 (My response was too long sorry :D)",
