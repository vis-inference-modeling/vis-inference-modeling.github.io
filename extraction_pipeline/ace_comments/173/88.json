  "raw_comment": "I notice that students with legacy status and whose parents’ income rank is in the top .1% are 7 times as likely to be admitted to a given school compared to a non-legacy student who is not incredibly wealthy. I also notice that people without legacy status who are incredibly wealthy have a much greater advantage than non-legacy students who have lower incomes. I wonder why these elite colleges place so much emphasis on financial status. If these families are already wealthy why should they be given even more advantages in life than they already have? Why do these schools not attempt to give opportunities to people who may not have a lot of money but have the potential to be incredibly successful if they are given the opportunity to study at a prestigious university? It is very likely that these legacy families donate large sums of money to the universities and continue to do so as their children and their grandchildren get accepted. These donations provide the university with significant benefits and could be a very likely reason why they choose to admit legacy students who are very likely to attend and who have parents who will provide continuous donations to the university during and after their time there. If they choose not to accept a legacy student they may lose some of their best donors, and prestigious universities make incredible amounts of money from their donations and would not want to lose these funds. -unifished see other post",
