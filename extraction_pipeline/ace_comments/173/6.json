  "raw_comment": "I noticed that the legacy applicants with parents of a higher income are more likely to get accepted. I wonder why colleges are more likely to accept students with more money or legacy students even though a first-generation student with less money may be a much better fit for the school. This applies to me because I am a first-generation student in a wealthy community.",
