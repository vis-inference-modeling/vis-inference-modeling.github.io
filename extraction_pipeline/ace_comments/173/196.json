  "raw_comment": "What do I notice? \nWith both the amount of wealth and legacy has great effects on the % of admission. Overall if you have higher of both then its a good thing but, if you have neither that's also good. There is however no inbetween.\n\n\nWhere did the stigma come from to have money and a legacy? Or neither. Is it really about BOTH or just the money. Is it a way for the top % to write money off on their taxes \n\nAs an up and coming college applicant, it's valuable to see how I place myself in these categories. Thinking about how myself as a student many stack up against other applicants of different demographics    \n\nAll or nothing, The extremes that colleges are looking for.",
