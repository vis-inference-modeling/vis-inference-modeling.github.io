  "raw_comment": "I notice there is a higher acceptance rate to these ivy league schools for students with parents that have higher income compared to students with lower. I wonder how many students of each income apply to these schools, and do they all have similar high school educations. I also wonder how this graph would look like in other countries where colleges are more affordable. Personally at my school there are varying students getting the same education with many different income rates. A catchy headline I came up with is, \"Are the costs of college preventing students from applying to ivy league schools?\"",
