  "raw_comment": "I noticed that it is more likely for the students whose parents earn a higher income to get accepted into elite colleges. I wonder why the wealthier families have the advantage of getting accepted compared to the lower class families. This doesn't really relate to me because I am not trying to get into an elite college or Ivy League at the moment. This might relate to my community because most of the students and their families are wealthy and I see that most of the hard-working students end up getting into good colleges. A catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea is \"Acceptance into College: Higher Legacy vs Higher Capability\"",
