  "raw_comment": "What do you notice? One thing I noticed was that the richer you are with legacy parents the more likely to get in. Essentially to have a decent shot at getting into elite colleges you need to have immense privilege. \n\nWhat do you wonder? One thing I wonder is why the poorer students are, the higher chance they have of getting in compared to wealthier non-legacy students, as well as how much of a role the “trauma essay” plays in this difference. \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community? As someone who will apply to college soon, it makes me realize just how complicated and competitive college admissions can be. Your station in life is a huge factor in the colleges you can or can’t go to, something prevalent in students' and parents' minds as applications start and deadlines roll in.\n\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea. “Ivy Leagues: Elite Schools or Elitists?”",
