  "raw_comment": "I noticed that Legacy students overall are almost two times more likely to get into Elite colleges than average students. I also noticed that the graph dipped around the 85th percentile but after that skyrocketed to being seven times more likely to be accepted. I wonder why the graph dips at around the 85th percentile. I also wonder why the two graphs stay the same until around the 50th percentile when they start to change drastically until the 99th percentile. This relates to me in my community as I am in high school and coming to the age where students have to seriously think about college, and things like this help students understand their acceptance rates to certain colleges. \n“Parents really do have a helping hand”",
