  "raw_comment": "Notice: I notice that legacy applicants have a greater chance of getting admitted to an elite college no matter the parents’ income. I also notice that there is a significant spike in both legacy and non-legacy applicants in the 99.9 parents’ income rank. I also notice that the difference between legacy and non-legacy applicants isn’t super significant until around the 70th rank of parents’ income. \nWonder: I wonder why the gap between legacy and non-legacy applicants isn’t significant until after the 70th rank for parents’ income? I also wonder why the admissions rate for non-legacy applicants dips below the average admissions rate between the 70th and 90th ranks for parents’ income? I wonder why the spike is so much higher for legacy applicants than non-legacy applicants after the 90th rank for parents’ income? I wonder what test score is being examined for this graph?\nRelate to You: This is applicable to me as the admissions advantage is present in all colleges, not just elite colleges. In order to get into college, I had to submit essays and complete applications regarding my parents’ education and financial status. Although I didn’t think about it at the time, I am sure that this information was probably part of the process of determining whether I would be admitted or not. \nHeadline: Parent Privilege at Elite Colleges",
