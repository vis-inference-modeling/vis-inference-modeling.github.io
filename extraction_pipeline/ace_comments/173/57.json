I also noticed that many people with higher income ranks have a significantly lower chance of getting in without a legacy.\n2.I wonder if legacy applicants with less amount of money get in due to scholarships or high academic performance. I also wonder why kids with higher parental income with no legacy have a lower chance of getting in.\n3.It relates to me and my community because as a senior in high school, it is interesting to see what colleges are looking for from their applicants, and if they look at your amount of money or your academic performance?\n4. \"College Applicants: What are they really looking for\"",
