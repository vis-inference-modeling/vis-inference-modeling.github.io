  "raw_comment": "I noticed that students with a legacy and rich parents were the most likely to be admitted to these elite schools. I wonder why legacy mattered so much even if students had rich parents and the same test scores. This can relate to my community since my brother is applying to Dartmouth and Cornell. I wonder if he will get in since my family is middle class and does not have legacies at either school. A catchy headline would be: \"Colleges: All men are created equal?\"",
