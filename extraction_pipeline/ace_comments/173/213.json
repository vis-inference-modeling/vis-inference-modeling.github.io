  "raw_comment": "I notice: The top income bracket has the most likely chance of getting into elite colleges by a large margin Without legacy status, students are much less likely to get into prestigious colleges. Without a legacy boost, it seems that people in the 50-85th income percentile are less likely to get in than lower income brackets. \n\nI wonder: What are some reasons why the wealthier are more likely to be admitted? Is it because the colleges recognize a chance for a payday? Why is there such a legacy boost? \nWould this trend continue at some less prestigious colleges? \n\nRelate to me and my community: Admissions statistics for colleges are going to be very important to me as well as many in my community who are looking to go to college in the next few years and trends such as these are concerning as many do not have legacy to any prestigious colleges which diminishes chances of getting in if we choose to apply. In addition, most in my area are middle class which also diminishes our chances of getting into prestigious programs according to the graph. \n\nHeadline: \nPrestigious College Admissions: an Exhibit of Plenitude and Legacy",
