  "raw_comment": "1) I noticed the likelihood of being admitted into a prestigious institution increases with your income. Compared to someone who is regarded as poor, their odds are about four times higher. \n\n2) I wonder if richer applicants typically get admitted to colleges because they can pay for their tuition more quickly than those who take out loans? Are they considered more reliable?\n\n3) This relates to me and my community because a lot of my friends and I are applying to colleges and there are more factors that go in to being accepted than we would have thought. Many of us would have to take out a loan and this may affect our acceptance.\n\n4) Money over Intelligence When it comes to College Acceptance?",
