  "raw_comment": "I notice that the wealthier you and your family are, the higher chance you have of getting into an Ivy League college. This is shown in the graph when the top 0.1% is 7x more likely to get into an Ivy League college compared to others.\n\nI wonder whether Ivy League colleges are more focused on the wealth and status of a student rather than their academic successes and abilities. It seems like these schools prefer and favor the richer and wealthier students so that makes me question if these schools aren't simply for the smartest, but for the wealthiest.\n\nThis relates to me and my community because many people in my community dream of attending an Ivy League school. But since they don't have the status that these schools favor, their chances are very low and require nothing short of a miracle to even have a chance to attend these schools.\n\nIs Your Social Status Worthy Enough For the Ivy Leagues?",
