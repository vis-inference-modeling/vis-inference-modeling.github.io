  "raw_comment": "I notice that when it comes to comparing students with the same test scores and figuring out who to admit to an elite college, legacy applicants have a much better chance of getting admitted. But, when money is added to the picture, non-legacy applicants that come from poorer families have a higher chance of being admitted than wealthy non-legacy applicants.This trend is shown throughout with the top 0.1% being 7x more likely to get in than someone with comparing attributes but no legacy.\n\nI wonder why the colleges pay attention to the students' background and income more than their test scores. If a non-legacy student had a higher test score than a legacy student would it convince the colleges to admit them over the legacy student?\n\nThis relates to me and my community because as a high schooler, we are preparing to enter college and pursue a career meaning people my age or older have to take in consideration of these details, we must be aware of our possibilities and take advantage of what we can. \n\n\nLegacy Status Is The Leeway to College! How Is This Fair To Others!\n\nWealthy in Knowledge or Wealthy in Reputation?",
