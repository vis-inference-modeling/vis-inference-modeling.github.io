  "raw_comment": "I noticed that money does have an effect on getting into Elite Colleges but not that big of an effect compared to legacy applicants. And seems to favor legacy applicants,which sucks because if i apply anywhere I won't be a legacy applicant. I wonder how they calculated the advantage without the legacy status This has a impact on me and my community due to most of the kids my age are looking for colleges and this graph will help them see the admissions advantages and disadvantages . Elite Colleges do you have legacy status. Overall the graph seems important to take a look at if you are an upcoming college applicant.",
