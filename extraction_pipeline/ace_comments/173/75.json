  "raw_comment": "This graph compares students with the same test scores and how their chances of being admitted to elite colleges can fluctuate based on their legacy status and their parent's income rank. It is clear from this graph that in every income rank, legacy status helps boost admission. I find it insane that very wealthy people with legacy status are 7x more likely to get into a school than a poorer person without status who worked just as hard to get the same scores. I wonder why there is such a bias in college admissions. One reason for this bias is that wealthy families may donate a lot of money to the school which could put applicants at an advantage. However, one would assume that by having all this wealth, one already has an advantage in life. Therefore, giving a wealthy and a poor person who both have legacy status and have the same scores unequal opportunities is solidifying those societal norms. Also the poor students not getting into these elite colleges because they are put at an inherent disadvantage when applying, it is further hindering their opportunities in life. I wonder if giving out financial aid is one of the reasons that poorer students who have the same credentials as wealthy students have a less likely chance of getting into a school. I know that financial aid is limited. This affects me because I will be applying to colleges soon. Some schools are doing away with legacy status, so I am not sure how much this graph will affect me. \n\"Legacy Boost= Bias\"",
