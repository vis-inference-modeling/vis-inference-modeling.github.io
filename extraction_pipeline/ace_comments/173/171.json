  "raw_comment": "1. I notice that students with legacy are 7x more likely to be admitted into a university when the students income is very high. However, even if the student with legacy isnt as wealthy they still have a high chance of being admitted compared to a student that isnt a legacy with high or low income. \n2. I wonder what specific schools they used to gather the data. I also wonder if the students admission profiles play a role for legacy students (if there is a change)\n3. This relates because students with legacy are put in high priority and many schools that I am close to also value legacy. \n4. Legacy Applicants Admission Chances Vs Non Legacy Applicants",
