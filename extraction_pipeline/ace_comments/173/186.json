  "raw_comment": "I notice that there is an obvious correlation between parents’ income and the likelihood of getting into an Ivy League. Also, when your parents or another close relative went to that college, the chances of getting accepted are about doubled for every income level. Additionally, I notice a subtle increase in acceptance rates at the low end of the income spectrum, presumably because of financial aid.\n\nI wonder why the Ivy League college system is like this; your chances of getting in are significantly larger if you’re extremely wealthy. I think it’s because the colleges like to have rich people attending their schools and the rich surely pay them a large amount of under-the-table money to get their sub-par children into such renowned schools. I think when so-called “elites” attend the Ivy Leagues, colleges then have the self-adorned right to raise tuition and make their school more prestigious.\n\nThis relates to me because I am a high school junior looking to go to a good college and I am curious about acceptance rates vs. income and other factors, such as the legacy status. My entire community is mostly just my school and a small town, so I suppose many of the people in my community (at least those whom I regularly interact with) would be concerned about similar issues within the elite college community.\n\nCatchy headline: Ive League Colleges: Wealthy in Knowledge or Wealthy in Reputation? Discover the astonishing magnitude of “elite” colleges’ lust for money and power",
