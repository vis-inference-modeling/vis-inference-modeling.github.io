  "raw_comment": "1.I noticed that legacy applicants have a higher chance of getting in to top tier colleges than non legacy students. I also noticed that the more money your parents makes you more likely to get in if you're parents are wealthy. \n2.I wonder why legacy students have a greater chance than non legacy students? I also wonder why there parents income affects there chance of getting into school. I wonder why there a dip in the student with no legacy?\n3. This relate to my community because it plays a role in determining if you get into college based on your parents income and if they attended not just your own success and test scores. \n4. My catchy headline is legacy or no legacy.",
