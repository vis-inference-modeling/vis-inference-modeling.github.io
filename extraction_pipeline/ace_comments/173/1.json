  "raw_comment": "From the graph, I noticed that legacy applicants have a significantly higher admissions rate across the board (over twice the average rate). However, those wither higher parental income had a proportionally larger benefit: up to 7 times the average for the top 0.1%, compared to less than triple (already high) for non-legacy. This leaves several burning questions: among them, why are admissions so heavily skewed in favor of high-income, legacy applicants, and what steps can colleges take to reduce this (likely-systematic) bias?",
