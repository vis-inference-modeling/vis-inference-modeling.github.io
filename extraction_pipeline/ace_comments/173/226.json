  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\nIn general, rich and legacy applicants are much more likely to be accepted than poorer and/or non-legacy applicants. The acceptance rate for legacy students generally increases the wealthier the family, while the acceptance rate for non-legacy students curves down before spiking. Both types of students acceptance rates spike at the 99.9th income rank.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nAt around the 85th income rank, the admission likeliness for non-legacy students drops below the average admissions rate. I wonder why it drops below at that particular income rank, and not the less-wealthy applicants - could financial aid have something to do with it?\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community? \nThis relates to me because I'll be applying to college pretty soon, and it's important to know the underlying discrimination of the college admissions process that only continues to grow more relevant. \n\nCatchy Headline:\nThe Inequality in \"Equally-Qualified\" Students",
