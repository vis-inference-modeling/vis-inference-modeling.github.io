  "raw_comment": "I notice that people with legacy have more admitted than those without it, even though their income might be less. Legacy students have a higher income rate than non legacy and than even the richest applicants. I also noticed the richest students who are also legacy applicants are most likely to be accepted. I wonder why the poorest students who are legacy seem to still have a good acceptance rate because you would expect them not to. I also wonder why the legacy students have an advantage regardless of other factors. It impacts me and my community because it is not long before I begin the college application process and these statistics and this information is becoming more relevant to me each year. I would title this graph \"Leading with Legacy\"",
