A good country thrives on how the people are educated and how well they have done in college. College is a big and important gap within people's lives. Their whole lives are based on what college they went to and how they did throughout. I don't want people to do bad just because they are caught up on money or any of that nonsense. It doesn't cost colleges much to enroll a student into they education system!",
