If your notice makes a claim, where in the graph is the evidence to support it?\n\nvery wealthy families as well as those with legacy are far more likely to be admitted. both graphs have a spike at the very end toward 99.9 percentile income. The darker line (legacy) is far above the lighter line (non legacy)\n\n2. What do you wonder?\n\nwhy colleges proritize legacy students\n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\n\nme and my classmates are all in the process of applying to college, and it is interesting to see the disparity in legacy and in wealth\n\n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\n\n\"College admissions: a 'legacy' of pandering to wealth\"",
