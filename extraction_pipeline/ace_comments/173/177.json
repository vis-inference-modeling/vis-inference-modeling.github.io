  "raw_comment": "1) Without legacy status, I've seen that your chances of getting admitted are lower the more money your parents make, unless you are among the top 0.1%.  However, students with legacy status do not fully follow the trend.  The admittance rate for legacy status students often rises with the income of their parents; if you are among the top 0.1%, your chances are nearly doubled.\n2)I wonder why the admissions process to Ivy League colleges is so competitive; the likelihood of being accepted increases dramatically with income. I believe this is the case because elite universities want wealthy students, and wealthy parents will undoubtedly pay them a lot of cash to get their inferior kids into such esteemed institutions. I believe that institutions have the conceited right to raise tuition and elevate their status when so-called \"elites\" enroll in Ivy League schools.\n3)This is relevant to my town as a large number of individuals there are preparing to enter college, and if this is taken into account when making admissions decisions, it might lead to issues with college admittance.\n4) \"Dear College Am I Rich Enough For You\"",
