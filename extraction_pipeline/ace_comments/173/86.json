  "raw_comment": "As I analyze the graph, I notice that it is focused on the distribution of admissions advantage at some elite colleges. It is shown that it is 7x more likely to be admitted in a school when having money compared to someone who does not. I can also see how the legacy and parents income can affect the chance of making it into a school. Overall, the graph is informal and helps conclude the rate of college students by emphasizing the distribution rate of legacy admission advantages. \n\nI wonder why a person's financial status can dictate their education. \n\nThis highly relates to my community being that the majority of the students in my town struggle financially. This will then be harder to get into colleges because of their financial status, discouraging them from going to college at all.\n\nNo Money? No Education.",
