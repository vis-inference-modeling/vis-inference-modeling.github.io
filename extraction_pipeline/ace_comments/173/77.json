  "raw_comment": "This graph shows the admissions advantages at elite colleges specifically looking at the advantages of legacy applicants. I notice that the 80th percentile of income lowers chances for both kinds of applicants (legacy and normal). I wonder why this is, because I would usually assume that the higher the parents' income, the higher the chances of being accepted into a university. This relates to me and my community because getting into elite colleges are very important in my and many others' teenagers lives, and it is important to know what factors influence admissions decisions, like being a legacy applicant. \n\"Legacy Lift: Access to Elite Colleges\"",
