I wonder why that little dip in the graph is there near 90th. This relates to me because I will be only the second person in my family to go to college, and I don't have that advantage that others have being a middle class and non legacy applicant which will hurt my chances of being admitted.\nTitle: The Apple Doesn't Fall Far From The Tree",
