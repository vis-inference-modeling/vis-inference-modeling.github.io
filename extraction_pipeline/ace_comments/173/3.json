  "raw_comment": "It's obvious that legacy applicants have a greater chance at getting a perfect sear on their college admissions steak compared to those lighting up the stove with their average admissions match. What I find most boggling is the same thing the article finds boggling: if colleges perpetuate privilege. I didn't even think this was a thing before. But this doesn't concern me too much as I don't have the brain nor dough for Harvard. That said, it is an eye-opener to learn how \"unfair\" it is.",
