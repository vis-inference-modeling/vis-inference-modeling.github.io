I also wonder why high prestige colleges look for applicants with a legacy; instead of the applicants with the best scores and criterion.\n\nThis relates to my community because people tend to judge others based on their education and what college they attended.  I am also starting to look at colleges to attend and I find it crazy that some elite colleges are this biased towards high income and legacies.\n\n\"Attending College May Not be as Easy as it Seems\"",
