I also notice that you are almost consistently 2 times more likely to get in if you are a legacy applicant. There is a large gap between the two lines.\n2. I wonder why money matters to these elite colleges if  all students pay the same tuition. I wonder why these colleges are so picky. I wonder who the legacy students relatives are that went to these schools, (parents, grandparents, aunts/uncles)\n3. This relates to my community because my friends and I have to apply to colleges soon. This definitely shows the biases of education.\n4. Catchy headline: Unfair Biases in College Admission?",
