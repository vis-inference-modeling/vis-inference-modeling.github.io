  "raw_comment": "It seems that the richer the applicant/ their family is, the more likely they are to be admitted. Along with this, legacy applicants are far more likely to be accepted. This would leave middle/lower income applicants at a severe disadvantage. I wonder how these elite universities are able to skirt around the obvious equity/ ethicality, and discrimination problems this highlights? Universities are not allowed to take bribes. So how is this allowed? I will very soon also be applying to university, and the knowledge of how different income levels could be a basis of discrimination in certain colleges may help me narrow down which one(s) I would feel comfortable attending. Catchphrase title - Elites only: how some applicants financial or social situations may affect their likeness of admissions.",
