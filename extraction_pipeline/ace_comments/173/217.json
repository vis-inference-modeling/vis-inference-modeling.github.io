  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\n\nThe trends for legacy and standard applicants almost mirror each other, however, legacy admissions remain higher throughout the whole graph. Also, as income increases, the admission rate increases. My guess is they would like to fuel donations to the school by admitting highly wealthy individuals.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\n\nI wonder why there is a tiny dip in the graph around the 90th percentile of wealth. You would expect, at least with my guess in the last question, that the admission rate should increase for more wealth, which is generally true. \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\n\nMy biggest community around me is my classmates. As we are approaching senior year, the college application process is less than a year away. While it may not contribute any useful information to my applications, it highlights the inequalities in the admissions process. Especially when considering elite colleges such as the ones polled, it alters my perspective of the identity of the university. While presenting itself as a prestigious and elite school, it looks as if all they want is your money.\n\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\n\nReal or Rigged: What drives the college admissions process",
