  "raw_comment": "1) I notice that legacy students have a greater chance overall of being admitted into elite schools than students without the status. After the 50th percentile, while the chances to get admitted for legacy students went up, it had gone down for students without the status. Students without the status chances of being admitted had decreased the richer their families were, even going below average until after the 90th percentile of parents' income rank as their chances rose again. \n\n2) Why is the legacy status valued more? Why did the chance of being admitted decrease so much for normal students between the 70th and after the 90th percentile of parents' income? How many students hold the legacy status in these schools?\n\n3) As many people are applying to college, it seems rather unfair that they'll have fewer chances of being admitted if they don't have the legacy status. As applying to elite schools is already very competitive, it is a great disadvantage as normal students also do the hard work getting the same grades, yet have less chances of getting in. When in all ways, students with legacy status always have the benefit of the doubt if they'll get in or not.\n\n4) The College Admission Game: Perks of Being Legacy Status",
