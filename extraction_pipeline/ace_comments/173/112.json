  "raw_comment": "1) I've seen that wealthier students are more likely to get into college. I've also noticed that students with legacies have a far better chance of getting accepted. It's not morally right but a common trend shown in this graph.\n\n2) I'm curious if you can still get in on Legacy despite not being wealthy, or if it will reduce your chances. Do universities allow more wealthy students because they can repay their tuition faster than those who take out loans? I wonder if someone with superior grades or a more remarkable resume can overcome a  family legacy.\n\n3) This affects me and my community since I know several students who will be the first in their families to attend college. My town isn't exactly wealthy, so how will they achieve their goal if legacies are preferred? My community will have a harder time if rates continue to rise at the same rate as the expected legacy increase. \n\n4) Did you get accepted into college or are you just a legacy?",
