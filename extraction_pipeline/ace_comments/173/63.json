  "raw_comment": "I noticed that for students who have a legacy at prestigious colleges, they will have a better chance at getting into the college versus students with the same test scores who do not have a legacy. I also notice that students who come from higher income households have a better chance at getting in. I wonder if the students with wealthier parents have a better chance because their parents are donating money or have a better reputation. This applies to me and my community because as kids are applying to colleges it is important to know how other people have more advantages and how it is unfair. \n\"Elite take on college\"",
