I wonder if the number of family members who attended before the students in the legacy portion of the study affected their admission. I am also to see if there is any change now that colleges have more of a desire to diversify their student body. I live in a college town. The college near me has a large number of legacy students ,and is fairly hard to get into, so this topic really interests me.",
