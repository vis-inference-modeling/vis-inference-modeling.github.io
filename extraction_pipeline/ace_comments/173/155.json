  "raw_comment": "1. According to the graph, I notice that legacy applicants with a wealthier background overall have a greater opportunity of being admitted into elite colleges. Whereas those with no legacy and a poorer status have a significantly lower possibility of being admitted into these elite colleges. In the graph, as parents' income rank continues to increase, applicants with a legacy can be up to 7x more likely to be admitted to elite colleges compared to those who have no benefits and no legacy which only fall into a little more than 2x probability of being admitted.\n2. Even though all students had the same test scores, I wonder why colleges choose to accept those with an overall financially stable background rather than giving an equal opportunity to all students. Is this due to colleges believing that wealthier students will be able to pay off any college debt compared to poorer students?\n3. This relates to me and my community because being that high schoolers are preparing to take on important decisions when choosing their dream colleges, these aspects that colleges are looking at can affect the acceptance rate of their admissions being accepted. \n4. Step 1:Money, Step 2:A legacy, Great, Welcome to college!",
