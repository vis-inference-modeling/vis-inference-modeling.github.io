  "raw_comment": "The skewed college admissions. \nThe graph depicts the components that affect the likelihood of acceptance into an elite college. A legacy with income in the 0.1 percentile is seven times more likely to get into elite colleges. This graph proves that legacy and income play a role in the college admissions process. I wonder if the reason income plays a role is so universities do not have to grant aid to students who need it. This applied to my community as I am a senior in the college admissions process. I do not have a legacy, being an immigrant.",
