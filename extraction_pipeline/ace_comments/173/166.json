  "raw_comment": "I notice that legacy students have a higher admissions rate than non legacy students no matter how wealthy they are. Whether you are legacy or not, your wealth provides you a significant advantage in getting in. Legacy students who are also wealthy see an even more significant boost in admission likelihood, around 7x than the average. I wonder if colleges had less monetary incentive  if the admissions rate for legacy students would be lower. Both of these factors can prevent average people who don't have historically wealthy families from climbing climbing the income ladder. \n\nIs legacy privilege unfair to average families?",
