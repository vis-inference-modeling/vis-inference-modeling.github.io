  "raw_comment": "What I notice in this graph is how students applying to colleges automatically get an advantage with being a legacy, but meanwhile, it shows how the more money a family makes the higher chances they have of getting into a harder school. Also how the families who are the richest and have the best legacy connections tend to have the absolute best chances of getting in over everyone else even if they have the same test scores. What I wonder is how having a lot of money and being a legacy have changed over the course of history. Did it used to always be this way? This affects my community because I was recently applying to colleges a few months ago and I was wondering how all of these factors could affect my application process as well. What is going on in this graph is it is trying to depict how parents who have higher incomes and students who have a legacy with the school, tend to be accepted over other students with similar test scores. \nHeadline: Money: What can't it help?",
