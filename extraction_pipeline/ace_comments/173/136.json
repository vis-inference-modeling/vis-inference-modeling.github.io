I notice that students with more wealth, and a family legacy have a much higher chance of being admitted to Ivy league schools as oppose to students without wealth and family legacies. The evidence is shown in the right side of the graph where it says 7 times as likely to be admitted if richer and legacy. \n2.I wonder why students with wealth and legacies are more likely to be admitted into Ivy league schools rather than students who do not have either a legacy or wealth.\n3.This relates to me and my community because i live in a low-middle class area which means that the chance of kids in my area going to an Ivy league school is very very low. Which is unfair to those who want to attend a good college and be successful.\n4.ivy leagues for the rich only?",
