  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\nI notice that legacy applicants with richer parents have a higher chance of getting into college. Whereas applicants who don’t have a legacy boost have lower chances of getting admitted to college. \nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why there is such a big gap between legacy applicants and non-legacy applicants who get into college. I also wonder why there is such a big gap between the richer and poorer side of the parent's income.\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to me and my community because we will be applying to colleges soon and we will need to consider if we are legacies in certain colleges to save up money to get into college. \nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea\nCollege: Only for the Rich and Those of Legacy",
