I wonder if this is due to the unfortunate middle ground they face, not poor enough for financial boosts, but not rich enough to buy your way in. As someone with a close family tie to an elite school, I know it is lucky that my chances of getting accepted are significantly boosted. I would name this graph,” Climbing the vines into Ivy League schools is easy for the rich”.",
