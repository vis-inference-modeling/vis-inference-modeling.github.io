  "raw_comment": "We notice that students who are legacy applicants of elite colleges have a significantly higher chance of being admitted into the college than those without legacy status. We also notice that applicants are more likely to be admitted if their parents' income rank is among the highest overall.\n\nWe wonder why is the Estimated Legacy Boost much higher between richer people who are legacy applicants and who aren't versus between poorer people who are legacy applicants and who aren't?\n\nThis relates to our community because in our high school, majority of the students come from middle-class income families and could have a chance at being accepted into elite colleges. The distribution of admission rates shows that elite colleges have hidden preferences over legacy students versus non legacy students, as well as richer families being more accepted than poorer families. Since we come from middle-class families, we should be more unsure about our chances of admission if we apply to an elite college, especially that we may not have a legacy boost to.\n\nHeadline: \"The Real Reason You Didn't Get Into an Elite College. All They Want is Your Money.\"",
