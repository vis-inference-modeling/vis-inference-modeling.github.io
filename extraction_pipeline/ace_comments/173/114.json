  "raw_comment": "This graph depicts the likelihood of admissions advantages at some colleges compared to those with the same test scores and a legacy advantage. I noticed how a legacy student with wealthier parents who are in the top 0.1% of income would be 7x more likely to be admitted into a school compared to a less wealthy student. That definitely must annoy students trying to get into an elite college. I also noticed that regardless of income, legacy applicants were admitted significantly higher than those without legacy status. I noticed that students who have a legacy advantage are more wealthy compared to those without a legacy advantage. I wonder how this could be and why there is a lesser legacy for students with low income. Maybe it could be because the wealthier applicants can afford high tuition costs and donate money to the elite college whereas the low-income ones would struggle and would request financial aid.  I wonder how income and legacy advantages affect a student getting into an elite college in the admission process. Like if you request financial aid are you more likely to be deferred or rejected? This affects me and my community because I am a sophomore who is starting to research college so next year I will be applying and looking at schools. Also, I have 2 older sisters who have applied to colleges without a legacy advantage and got in. But my family friend with a legacy advantage for Villanova as her uncle went there, got differed. \nTitle of graph: Legacy",
