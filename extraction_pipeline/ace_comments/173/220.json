  "raw_comment": "One of the things I noticed about this graph is that without the legacy boost, in around the 70-80th income rank it actually drops, but in the same spot, it grows for legacy students. I also noticed that the x-axis consistently grows by twenty until the end where it only grows by 9.9. I think they did this to make the system seem more rigged than it is. One thing I wonder is how this has changed over time, gotten better or worse, etc. This relates to me/and my community because it shows that the college system is unfair and that will affect basically everyone who applies to colleges. I would name this: A Look Into Unfair Biases In Colleges.",
