  "raw_comment": "The graph depicts how being a legacy affects an applicant's chances of being accepted into a school. For more elite schools, the familial ties a student has to a school could be the largest factor in their application, boosting their chances about 7x. Nearly all students at the most prestigious universities are legacy students. This affects me because I am in the college admissions process. My chances of being admitted to an Ivy League are very low because I am not a legacy at any of them. I wonder why this kind of bias is still allowed in the decision process. There have been legislations passed in the last few years that have taken race, economic, and standardized testing bias out of the process. The fact that legacy consideration is still used seems unethical. A possible headline could be \"How are your chances of getting into Harvard?\"",
