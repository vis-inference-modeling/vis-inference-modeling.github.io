  "raw_comment": "I notice that your legacy and income does have an impact on your application status. I also noticed that students with hard working parents were more likely to be admitted by 2-7 times. \n\nI wonder how many students were taken into account for every income category, low medium, and high income. Because if more students were recorded for the high income applications compared to low income, this could change the data slightly. I also wonder how this data would change today if it was recorded in the past 5 years. \n\nThis relates to my community because there are a wide range of incomes and alumni families. Making admission more competitive for different students. I also go to a public school, and I know those that go to private schools are very dedicated to their education because they can afford to. So I wonder how many of these students came from public vs. private schools. \n\nDoes your family legacy and income really impact your application status?",
