  "raw_comment": "1. I noticed that legacy applicants had at least a doubled chance of being admitted and as parents' income rank increase so did the chance of admission. However, I noticed that the students whose parents had an income rank that was in the 50th rank or the middle rank had less of a chance of being admitted into the college.\n\n2. I wonder why the legacy students' whose parents' income rank was in the middle of the rank or in the 50th rank had less of a chance of admission than the other legacy students with a lower or higher rank. Is this graph telling us that there is a possible abundance of legacy students with parents who are in the 50th income rank? Are people in the middle class experiencing some form of discrimination in the college process? Are we experiencing injustice or high demand?\n\n3. This relates to my community in a great deal of ways. I am currently in high school and I plan to go to college. I am aware that college isn't the goal for all high school students, but I know that many students future plans include going to college. The people I surround myself with are mostly all academically motivated and are all trying very hard to make themselves appealing to colleges. We constantly strive to get good grades and fill our schedules with clubs and extra curriculars, while simultaneously keeping a social life. We are in high school after all.\n\n4. ARE THE CHANCES OF BEING ADMITTED TO COLLEGE CONNECTED TO INCOME AND LEGACY?",
