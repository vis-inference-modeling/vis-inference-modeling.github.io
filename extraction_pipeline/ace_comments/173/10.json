  "raw_comment": "Looking at the graph, I can see that, for legacy applicants, applications of those with a family income rank of more than the 50th percentile essentially stays at a rate of 2.5 times as likely or more to be accepted. However, I'm noticing that non-legacies with an income rank of about 85% are under 1 times as likely to be accepted into an elite college. \n\nAfter analyzing the graph, I wonder how these admissions numbers will be impacted over the next several years. After the Supreme Court case in June that eliminated affirmative action in terms of college admissions on the grounds of things like race, I'm curious to see how this will extend to legacy statuses. Legacies aren't necessarily considered to be disadvantaged, but non-legacies may be, so it'll be interesting to see if legacy admissions rise or drop. \n\nThis graph doesn't necessarily affect my immediate community very much, as I don't know anyone who was aiming to be accepted into a highly selective college. However, I do live in the general proximity of Rice University, which is a very selective college that likely exhibits admissions bias based on whether someone is a legacy and the income bracket that they are in. \n\nA headline that captures the graph's main idea might be \"Application Distortion: Legacies vs. Everyone Else.\"",
