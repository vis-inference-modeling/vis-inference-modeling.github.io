Something like TikTok?\n3) This relates to me because my older sister attends the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League school. In addition, the graph is relatable because if she didn't excel in high school and had multiple extracurriculars, she would've had to pay like 50,000 USD. Still, instead, she had about the whole thing covered and now only has to pay around 2,000 USD.\n4) petition to abolish college tuition",
