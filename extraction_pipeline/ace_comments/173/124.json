  "raw_comment": "1. I noticed that regardless of income, legacy applicants were admitted significantly higher than those without legacy status. Furthermore, even with the highest income the likelihood of students being admitted is slightly over 2x which pales in comparison to legacy students with a 99.9 parent income rate.\n2. I wonder how income factors into the school's decisions as to who is admitted and who isn't. Does the number of legacy students being admitted suggest nepotism? What makes legacy students better applicants than non-legacy students? Does it matter what the alumni did at these schools for the legacy students to get admitted?\n3. This relates to me and my community as being from an urban community it means that a number of my classmates/peers have not had the same fortune of being legacy students/having parents that were alumni thus making admission that much harder for those already at a disadvantage for something completely out of their control (with parental/guardian income also being completely out of these students control). \n4. Nepotism at Ivy, Advantages Not Even Money Could Buy!",
