I notice how non-legacy applicants from the 10th to 65th percent have a 2x advantage of being accepted in the universities compared to non-legacy applicants from the 65th to 90th. The graph decreases from the 65th to 90th percent income applicants, explaining how richer students are disadvantaged in college acceptance even with the same test scores. After the 90th to the 99th percent, acceptance significantly increases to approximately 2.5 times more.\n\nFor legacy applicants, the average admissions rate on the poor side begins at 2.5x. Unlike the non-legacy students, the chance of being accepted as a legacy student increases from 3x to 3.5x after 50 percent. A similar outstanding increase at the 99th percentile is also illustrated, reaching 7x the likelihood of being admitted!\n\n2. I wonder why the two lines went in opposite directions after reaching the 50th percent of income. Why did the legacy applicants have an advantage while the non-legacy applicants had a disadvantage after 50? Have colleges made an effort to change this system of discrimination since 2015? I also wonder if the families in the 99th percentile are admitted for the funding they can offer to the school.\n\n3. This article relates to me because when I apply to universities, being a legacy or non-legacy student for specific schools and my parents' income would significantly affect my admissions.\n\n4. Are you disadvantaged in being accepted into some of the most prestigious universities in the United States?",
