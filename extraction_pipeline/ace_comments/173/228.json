  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\n\nLegacy applicants and students with higher SES parents are more likely to be admitted to elite colleges.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\n\nWhat moderator or mediator variables are under the hood here? SES is not revealed on an application but how does 18 years of having parents with a higher SES impact the quality of a student's application?\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\n\nMississippi residents often stay in the state for college. Therefore, few Mississippi students have parents who attended one of these elite colleges. Also, the SES of Mississippi is relatively low. Does this make it unlikely for Mississippi students to get admitted to elite colleges? What makes a college elite and why are there no elite colleges in the south? What is the return on investment (ROI) on attending an elite college? \n\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\n\n\"Cycles of Power & Privilege\"",
