  "raw_comment": "I noticed that students from middle class families are at a disadvantage compared to students from high income families when it comes to getting into a good college. This could also mean that if a family member went to the same institution in the past, that student gets an unfair advantage for admission. Large institutions also take donations as part of the admissions process and low to middle income families cannot pay those.",
