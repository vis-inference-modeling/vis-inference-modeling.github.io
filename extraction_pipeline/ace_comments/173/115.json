  "raw_comment": "The graph depicts the admissions rate for students with the same test scores, and how they vary based on legacy and parent's income. Legacy applicants are much more likely to be admitted. For income, the general trend seems to be that the more an applicant's parents make, the better chance they have. \nHowever, there is one anomaly that I noticed. For those who are not legacies, the admittance rate goes down before going back up at around the 90th percentile. I'm not sure why this is. Maybe universities try to accept students who are either extremely wealthy or poor. \nAs someone who is looking to go to college, I don't want to be impaired by something I can't control, such as how much money my parents make. This inequality affects every students striving to get a higher education by promoting those who already have an advantage.\nHeadline: COLLEGE ADMISSIONS ASSESS MORE THAN GRADES",
