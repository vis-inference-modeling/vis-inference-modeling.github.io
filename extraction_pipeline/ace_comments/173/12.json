  "raw_comment": "What do you notice? I noticed that being a legacy applicant significantly increased the student’s chances of being admitted into the school. So, it seems that schools care deeply about passing on the legacy of attending their school.\nWhat do you wonder? I wonder why being in the 70 to 90th percentile decreases the chance of being accepted. Your parents obviously have more money to afford the school. Why would the school decrease the number of students in the income bracket?\nHow does this relate to you and your community? As a gymnast, who is not a legacy applicant to the colleges I would like to attend, I am trying to get admitted using a non-traditional way by being recruited for gymnastics. This would allow me to circumvent many issues like not being a legacy applicant.\nHeadline that describes the graph: Elite College Admissions Unveiled",
