  "raw_comment": "What do you notice? \n-The applicants with parents on the wealthier end of the spectrum who are not legacies are less likely to get accepted then poorer non-legacy applicants. \n-People with rich, alumni parents are the most likely to be accepted into the university. \n-Where the rich alumni admissions spike, the rich non-alumni applicant admissions drop. \n\nWhat do you wonder? \n-Why are these students applying? What is their reasoning behind their applications? \n\nWhat’s the relation? \nBoth of my parents are alumnis at Michigan State University. It thus follows that I’ve grown up going to campus- I love it up there, however that doesn’t mean that I want to go there. However, a lot of people want (or expect) me to go there because of my parents. I wonder then, what the pressure on the legacies is. Perhaps the Ivy Leagues favor legacies. But, could it also be that a lot of the legacies applying there apply because they are legacies? \n\nTitle: \nA Legacy of Parental Pressure",
