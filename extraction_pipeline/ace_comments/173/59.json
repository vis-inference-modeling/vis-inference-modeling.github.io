  "raw_comment": "One of the things that I noticed from this graph was that the greater the income the more chances for admissions acceptance on elite colleges. For the average admissions rate without legacy status is lower than the ones that have legacy on those colleges.  The people who have a legacy or relative who attended these colleges have 7 chances ahead of the students without relatives who attended these colleges before them.  I wonder why the students who have relatives at those colleges have better chances than the people who are going to their colleges for the first time. And why does the parent's income also impact their admissions? \nThis graph can be a good example of how college acceptance can impact the college's applications of the High Schools that don't have the right income or families on colleges.  \nDoes income influence college acceptance?",
