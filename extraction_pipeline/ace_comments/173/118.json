If your notice makes a claim, where in the graph is the evidence to support it?\nThe legacy boost isn’t even as you move across the line of the income status (the boost for 70th is much higher than 10th, but a lot lower than 99th) \nFor those in the top 10% of wealth, if they are a legacy, their chances of being accepted skyrocket, especially compared to those who aren’t legacy and are in the bottom 70-80%. \n\n2. What do you wonder?\nWhat test was used?\nWhat were the scores? \nWhy did they choose only these schools? \nDid they account for the fact that some schools only removed their legacy policy in the later dates of the range of which they studied, which would skew the data? \nIt’s highly unlikely that test scores are the only thing that influences admission, so what other variables could be impacting admission, such as their essay, resume, etc.? \n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nSince I am a senior and I am applying to college, for elite colleges, I am often competing with applicants who have legacy. This makes it harder for me to get into the colleges that I want because those with legacy have a higher chance of getting in, which then lowers my own chance of acceptance. \n\n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\nElitism of Elite Schools\nDaddy's Money gets you in the Ivy League",
