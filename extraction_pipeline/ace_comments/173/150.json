If your notice makes a claim, where in the graph is the evidence to support it?\n\nthe more money you have, the more likely you will be accepted into a prestigious school. Their chances are around 4x higher than someone who is considered poor. \n\n2. What do you wonder? Do colleges tend to admit more students with money because they can pay off the tuition faster than those who take out loans?\n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community? As a senior in high school, me and my friends are all applying to colleges right now and deciding where we want to go. Household income isn't as much of an issue in my community as it is in neighboring towns but it still affects a good amount of my peers when applying to colleges. \n\n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea. The Effect of Household Income on College Acceptances",
