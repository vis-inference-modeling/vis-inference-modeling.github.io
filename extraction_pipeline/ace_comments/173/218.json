I also noticed that no matter how high or low the income the legacy will always give the applicant an advantage over someone who doesn't have a relative that attended the college\n-I wonder which college is the most biased towards this legacy boost and why there is a small dip right before the rise in the chart. I also wonder how the people attending the school would vary if the colleges weren't given this information\n-This relates to me because I am currently a Junior in high school and will be looking into college very soon. While applying to colleges I will have this thought in my mind about how my chances of getting into schools that my parents didn't attend will be lower than the ones they did\n-Headline: Ivy League or Legacy League",
