  "raw_comment": "It was interesting to see how much a student's legacy can effect their acceptance rate, especially for students of parent's with higher incomes. For students of parents who have a mid to high income, legacy has a significant boost on their acceptance rates. I wonder why legacy is so important to these colleges. Parents and their children can differ significantly in character traits and personalities, which makes the idea of legacy a questionable way to admit students. If these colleges' goal is to attract and accept the most intelligent, talented, and skilled students, why is such an emphasis placed on legacy? It seems irresponsible of these colleges to accept based on legacy and unfair to the multitude of highly talented students who are rejected because they lack legacy.",
