I wonder why there is a dip in the estimated legacy boost between the 75th - 90th percentile. I also wonder why the rates boosted up so suddenly after the 50th percentile.\n3. This is relevant to me and my community because soon we will be looking to apply at colleges. Will this impact what schools we consider applying to just because we are scared of rejection?\n4. Are College Admissions Considering Wealth Over Grades and Work Ethic?",
