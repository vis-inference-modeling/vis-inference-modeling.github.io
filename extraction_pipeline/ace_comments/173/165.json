  "raw_comment": "I notice that this graph, very clearly shows that, despite colleges claiming it doesn't matter, being a legacy applicant as well as being in the top 1% of income dramatically increases the chances of being admitted to elite colleges.  The evidence for this is clearly shown on the furthest right end of the graph when it increases exponentially starting at around 90th percentile or top 10%.  This is even more dramatic when those people are legacy applicants.    I wonder if colleges will ever truly not take legacy into account and give everyone equal opportunities regardless of whether their family attended the school.  This relates to me and my community because this means we have less chance of getting into those kinds of high-end colleges compared to someone who is a legacy and also extremely rich.  A catchy headline could be \"Data Shows Elite Colleges Who Preach \"Equity\" Still Favor Legacies and the Upper Class.\"",
