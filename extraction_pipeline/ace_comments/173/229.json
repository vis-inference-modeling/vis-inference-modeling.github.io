  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\n\nI notice that those whose families are richer it is written “Estimated legacy boost” which refers to the cycle of, those with money end up with a better education and in better colleges which then boost their legacy and makes them richer once again, whereas the poorer families often don't have the same opportunities for education to those who have more money and they have to work harder because they can’t rely as much on their financial situations.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\n\nI noticed that it says that this data is from over the year 1999-2015 so, how would this graph compare to another graph of the same situation but in 2023, has this problem gotten better or worse? I wonder what benefits does it bring to a school if a kid has money or a legacy? How might this compare to a graph of non-elite colleges?, I’d assume that they might be less influenced by money considering they have less of a legacy.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\n\nIn my community people use what college their family attends/ attended as a way to compare people, but this graph has shown me that if it not a fair comparison because of the obvious influence that money and relations has on prestigious schools.\n\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\n\nHow your families financial situation can influence your education opportunities.",
