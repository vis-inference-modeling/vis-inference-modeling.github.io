The first jump in estimated boost begins around the 70th income rank percentile for both legacy and non-legacy applicants. Around the 50th and 80th percentile advantage for students with and without legacy status goes down. \n\n2.I wonder what caused a drop in admission advantages for both groups of students around the 50th and 80th percentiles.\n\n3.In my high school, every year students apply to all different kinds of colleges and universities. It is both interesting and tiresome to see that just because of a student's income and legacy status, they might have a better chance of getting into college. It is sad that students that have scores and resumes on the same level may get rejected from certain colleges and universities because of things that they cannot control.\n\n4.Should Legacies Be the Only Ones to Leave a Legacy?",
