  "raw_comment": "This graph shows the difference in admissions at elite colleges, by comparing legacy applicants and non-legacy applicants, with parents' income rank also being a factor. It surprises me that applicants with more wealthy parents have a lower chance of acceptance. I wonder why this is a factor. I also wonder how scholarships and financial aid play a role in this. This relates to me and my community, given that me and my peers will soon be going through the college admissions process, and it is important to know what factors admissions officers value. \"Legacy Leverage\"",
