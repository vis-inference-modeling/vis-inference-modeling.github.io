  "raw_comment": "From the first glance I noticed how significant of a role  your admission rate is impacted by being a legacy applicant whose parent's income falls under 99%. The chances are significantly higher even for kids whose parents' income does not fall in the top 99%. Another thing that I noticed was for those who fell under the category of parents income between the 70th and 90th percentile actually had a lower admission rate than those who had slightly lower and higher income. I wonder why the mixture of being a legacy and your parents income being within the 99 percentile increases your chance far greater than any other combination shown in the graph. I see others around me in highschool spending countless hours perfecting their craft, studying till the break of dawn, volunteering and starting impactful foundations for their chances to be super seeded by those with legacy and their parents having being in a higher income range. A catchy headlines could be \"Silver Spoon Scholars: How legacy and Parental Wealth shines in College Admissions\".",
