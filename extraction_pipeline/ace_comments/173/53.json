  "raw_comment": "1. After looking closely at the graph above (or at this full-size image), answer these four questions:\n\nWhat do you notice?- I noticed that if you're rich and have family that went there, you're golden. If you're rich with no family, you still have a chance. If you're not rich with family, you have a chance, and if you're not rich and don't have family who went there, it's over for you pal.\n\nWhat do you wonder?- I wonder if things would be different if they stopped taking parental income into the equation.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?- I live in a town where many people went to ivy league schools so this isn't super new information. Lots of students are pushed to go to ivies because their parents went.\n\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea: \"No money? No admittance.\"",
