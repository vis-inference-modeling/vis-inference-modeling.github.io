  "raw_comment": "1. I noticed that legacy applications were admitted at a considerably higher rate than non-legacy applicants, irrespective of income. Additionally, the chance of admission for students with the greatest income is little over two times, which is insignificant when compared to legacy students who have a parent income rate of 99.9.\n2. I wonder about the role that money plays in the school's admissions process. Is there evidence of favoritism in the amount of legacy students being admitted? What distinguishes legacy students from non-legacy students as superior applicants? Does the admission of legacy students depend on the actions of their alumni at these schools?\n3. This is relevant to me and my community because I'm from an urban area, which means that many of my peers and classmates have not had the same luck as me in being legacy students or having parents who were alumni. As a result, admission is even more difficult for those who are already at a disadvantage due to circumstances beyond their control.\n4. Rags To Riches, Is Favoritism Ending Fair Chances?",
