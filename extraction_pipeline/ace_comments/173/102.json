  "raw_comment": "- What do you notice\nColleges are more likely to accept students who are rich and are legacy students. We can see there is a large gap between the two lines that stays consistent for the whole graph, the legacy students have around a 2x greater chance of being admitted regardless of income.\n- What do you wonder\nIs this true for non ivy league schools as well?\nSince colleges have become more selective have they started to consider money as a deciding factor or have their standards just been raised?\n- How does this relate to your community?\nMany students do not fall into the 90th or higher percentile or are not legacy students. Knowing this data can help us understand more about what schools are looking for.\n- Catchy headline\nThe Data Behind College Admissions: Does Your Income and Legacy Truly Matter?",
