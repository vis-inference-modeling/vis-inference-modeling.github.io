  "raw_comment": "1. This graph represents the likelyness of students with the same test scores but different legacy situations have of getting into an elite school. I noticed that throughout the whole graph, whether rich or poor, legacy students have a better chance of getting into an elite college. I noticed the richer they are, the higher the boost will get as well, the top .1% has 7 times the chance of getting admitted.\n2. I wonder why students haven't complained about how unfair it is to get into an elite school. I also wonder just how much money a rich legacy parent must donate so that schools turn their eye and let students in. I wonder how much of a factor test scores make for admissions.\n3. This affects my community as a senior as we are looking to get into colleges and have to see the competition we are getting put up against. Rich non legacy students have a lesser chance of getting into the elite schools because they dont fit the criteria of poor diverse students they want to make their school look good or rich legacy students which can throw money at them.\n4.  \"Is College Rigged\"",
