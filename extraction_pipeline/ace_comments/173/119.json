  "raw_comment": "I notice that the estimated legacy boost is much higher for the top 0.1%-- they are 7 times as likely to be admitted. I also notice that the upper middle class (75-90th income rank) has a lower than average admission rate. The admissions rate tends to be higher than average for poorer and richer families.\n\nI wonder when admission rates became so much higher for legacy students; did the trend start when admissions became more selective? I also wonder why the upper middle class is disadvantaged in college admissions. Is there anything being done to mitigate the legacy boost? Also, do the top  0.1% also fare better because they have more money to invest in extracurriculars and tutoring?\n\nThis relates to me and my community because I will enter college soon. Since my classmates and I will be competing against legacy students who have a much higher likelihood of getting into selective schools, this may hurt our chances at admissions.\n\nThis graph shows the disparate admission rates at elite colleges for legacy and nonlegacy students, as well as between the rich and the poor.\n\n\"The Golden Touch: College Admissions\"",
