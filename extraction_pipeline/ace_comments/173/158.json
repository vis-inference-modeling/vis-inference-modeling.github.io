  "raw_comment": "I noticed that being a legacy applicant when applying to a elite college, boost your chances of being admitted when having the same percentile income as a regular applicant. Having a higher amount of income still will cost your chances of being admitted itself, but legacy does a huge favor. I wonder which elite school were chosen to be apart of this graph and how they could alter the data if one college has different perspectives on legacy backgrounds. This could affect any community with college applicants because all citizens differ in income and college backgrounds, altering their children's college acceptance.",
