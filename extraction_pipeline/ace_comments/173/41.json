  "raw_comment": "I've found that, compared to typical students, Legacy students have an approximately twofold higher chance of being accepted into Elite universities. Additionally, I saw that the graph fell at the 85th percentile, but then it shot up to seven times higher acceptance rates. Why does the graph dip at about the 85th percentile, I wonder? In addition, I'm curious as to why, up until approximately the 50th percentile, neither graph changes significantly; after that, they start to diverge until the 99th percentile. In my neighborhood, I can relate to this because I'm a high school student approaching the age when students need to start thinking seriously about college. Resources like these assist students understand the admission rates to different universities.\n\n\"Knowledge is Liberty\"",
