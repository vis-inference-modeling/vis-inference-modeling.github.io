  "raw_comment": "When I look at the chart for a student with no legacy only, it looks like colleges are trying to “fix” income inequality, except perhaps at the top. A parent-income between 50% and 85% seems to work against the student, and the chance of admission without legacy is exceptionally low. \n\nI wonder why the legacy boost also dips around the 85% percentile and if donations to colleges increase as parents' income exceeds the 85% mark.\n\nI also wonder what the exact student numbers of legacy vs. non-legacy are for every parent-income number. If legacy is a relatively small number of students, it may be justified for colleges to give this boost to a few ex-students who donated to or otherwise helped their college.\n\nHeadline: The Multi-Generational Benefit of an Ivy League Education.\n\n(And the resulting stress to \"break in\"!)",
