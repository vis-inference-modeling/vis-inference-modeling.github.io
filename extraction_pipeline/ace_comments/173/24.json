  "raw_comment": "Apart from the stand-out jump in the admission rate for legacy applicants of the 99.9% income percentile, I found it interesting that the admissions rate was higher for non-legacy applicants of the <50% income percentile than it were for the 50-95% higher income percentile of those applying. Interestingly enough, the admissions rate for the same income brackets of legacy applicants do not follow this trend but rather continually get higher until reaching the extremes.\nI wonder of what the admissions graph would look like if instead of using the income percentiles, the graph used fixed yearly salaries. According to what I saw in the bottom of the page, the 99 or 99.9 percentiles represented those with an income of 620k+, I would be interested to see how admissions rates change in the millions or tens/hundreds of millions range. I believe that this graph relates to Texas in the way that many students in this state, regardless of socioeconomic status, do not even apply to out-of-state colleges in the first place. Many students are happy to stick with applying with their regional legacy schools. As being from an immigrant family in Australia with no prior experiences of the American College system, I find it interesting regarding the state boundaries that many confine themselves to as the equivalent state/province boundaries in Australia are nowhere near as considered. For a title: \"Elite Admissions Opportunities Impacted by Socio-Economic Status.\"",
