  "raw_comment": "- I notice that legacy applicants always have a higher chance of being accepted, no matter how rich or poor. Also, for non-legacy applicants, the ranking with the second highest chance of being accepted is 30th, and the lowest is between 80 and 90, which shows that it's not a perfectly direct correlation between how rich you are and how likely you are to get into the school. However, for legacy applicants, the line is more extreme and favors richer students more.\n- I wonder how this data was collected and why both lines have a tiny peak right before they get really steep. Additionally, I wonder if the problem would be solved by colleges not having access to parents' income information or whether the applicant is a legacy. The latter would be harder to accomplish, but it seems like withholding the info about money would be relatively easy.\n- This relates to my community because I interact with both people who might be legacy applicants and people who might be the first in their family to go to college. The fact that these people would have different chances of getting into an elite college despite having the same test scores is truly frustrating and unfair.  \n- My headline is \"Affluent Legacy Applicants Receive Extreme Advantages in Elite College Admissions\"",
