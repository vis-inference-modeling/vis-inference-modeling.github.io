  "raw_comment": "I noticed that legacy applicants have a significant advantage in the college admissions process over people applying without a legacy status to elite colleges. However, I also noticed that it is 7 times more likely that a legacy applicant to an elite college would be admitted if their parents’ income is higher than the 90th percentile. Additionally, I find it interesting that there is a dip in the graph for applicants without a legacy status in which the parents are around the 70th percentile in income. This is intriguing because parents with a relatively low income (in the “poorer” income rank) were two times as likely to be admitted. With this, I noticed and wondered why the “poorer” and “richer” extreme income rank almost reached the same likelihood of admittance for non-legacy applicants. Furthermore, I wonder how the graph would appear individually for each of the elite colleges (which elite college favors more legacies overall?). The graph relates to my community because as a senior, I along with many of my classmates are going through the college admissions process. This makes me wonder how money and legacies will affect my classmates’ admissions to certain colleges. \n\n“Are Elite Colleges Truly for Elite Students or the Elite?”",
