  "raw_comment": "I noticed that overall, regardless of income, legacy applicants have a much better chance of getting into elite colleges. However, non-legacy applicants who come from poorer families have a better chance than non-legacy applicants who come from wealthier families except for the very rich. The very rich non-legacy applicants have the best chance overall out of the non-legacy applicants.\nI wonder if the college looks at the students' backgrounds. Is this why the legacy applicants have a better chance? Would having higher test scores than a legacy applicant still put you at a disadvantage? How much does income really compare to legacy status?\nThis relates to me because I am a high school student who is going to be applying to colleges soon. I want to know how much income and legacy will really affect my chances at different colleges. This relates to my community because my friends are going to have to go through the exact same process. It will be interesting to see how the applications and results shake-up when it is all finished.\nAre Colleges Picking Favorites?",
