  "raw_comment": "It appears that as Parents’ income rank rises, so does the estimated legacy boost. Also, up until roughly the 85th percentile for Parents’ income rank, there is a decrease in the likelihood to be admitted, whereas there is on average a consistent likelihood to be admitted after the legacy boost. Finally, after the 85th percentile, there is an increase in admission likelihood for both students with and without the legacy boost, although there is a more drastic increase for those with the legacy boost.\nI wonder why the likelihood of admittance for legacy applicants remains close to constant for most of the graph. Why does the likelihood of admittance drop so drastically for non-legacy applicants around the 70th Parent’s income rank?\nFor people from my community, this shows that those with parents who graduated from selective schools are more likely to be admitted than those whose parents did not graduate from a selective school. We could also generalize this to more than just the twelve selective schools and say that applicants are more likely to be admitted to a school if their parents graduated from there. \n“Systemic generational bias in higher education”",
