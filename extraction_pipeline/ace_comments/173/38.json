What are the \"some elite colleges\" mentioned? Does extracurriculars and grades affect this graph (not just test scores)? \n\nThis relates to me and my community because I am in High School and will be applying to colleges soon. Also, both my parents attended a top 20 college in the US so I am wondering if that would help my chances at getting in. My understanding is no because both my older siblings applied and did not get in. \n\n\"Do Family Ties Really Secure the Knot For Education?\"",
