The legacy has a boost and is more likely to get in. \n\nI wonder how this graph would change depending on the year it was taken in. I also wonder why the 75th- 90th percentile is below average and the 10th percentile of income is above. \n\nThere aren't that many very rich people where we live, that are in the 99.5% so I feel like you have to be very educated and intelligent to be able to get into a top school. There aren't that many people who have parents who have went to top schools before either. \n\nHeadline:\n\nColleges of excellence: Are you a top candidate?",
