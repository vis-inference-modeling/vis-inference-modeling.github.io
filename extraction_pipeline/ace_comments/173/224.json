  "raw_comment": "Notices: I notice that as the Parent's income get's larger, the applicant's chance of getting in is higher. I also notice that kids who've had a relative attend before them are also more likely to get in.\nWonders: I wonder what colleges these include. What were these test scores? What if we compared this by race, or citizens versus not? Does coming from a 90th percentile family (income vise) give you more of an advantage versus being a legacy? How does this compare year by year?\nCommunity: This impacts the community because if you want to get into an elite college, but you are not a legacy student or come from a poorer background, but have the same test scores of a legacy student who comes from a richer background, you may be more likely to be rejected. Also, I will be applying to colleges in a few years so these biases will matter to me!\nA good headline might be: The Admissions Boost of Legacy students & richer families.",
