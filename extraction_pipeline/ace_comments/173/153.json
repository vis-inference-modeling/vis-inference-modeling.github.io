If your notice makes a claim, where is the evidence to support it in the graph?\nI noticed that the parent's income rate in the 99th percentile has a massive 6x boost of their kid being admitted.\n2. What do you wonder?\nWhat is the income difference between parents in the 90th percentile and those in the 99th percentile, how does their income compare as they have a noticeable difference in their child being admitted?\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis impacted me when I applied to schools and all of the kids in. my grade that applied to \"elite schools\" had a chance of being admitted based on their parent's income.\n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\nHow Powerful Can Money Be When It Comes To Being Admitted To Top Universities?",
