  "raw_comment": "I noticed that legacy students of all income rankings tend to see significantly higher admission rates than non legacy students. To a certain extent, income also seems to be a determining factor in admission rates. Students with family incomes ranking in the top 10% are much more likely to be admitted than those in the bottom 10%. \n\nThe fact that students are more likely to be admitted when their family income is higher is interesting. Many colleges claim to be need-blind when looking at college applications, so the data has to be due to other factors possibly influenced by higher income. Students with more resources have easier access to information, tutors, or other outside assistance. These resources are likely to positively impact their academic performance and college applications. However, students with less resources end up disadvantaged in comparison to these students.\n\nThis graph sheds light on how a student’s family background — something they have no control over — can impact their lives. A student whose family has a higher income and more access to resources will typically end up more successful than one with a lower income. As a community, students with less access to resources needed for academic excellence need to be addressed. If we can address this issue, we can reduce the disparity between legacy and non-legacy, or high-income and low-income.\n\nHeadline:\nLeaving Others Behind:  Legacy and High-Income Students Secure College Spots at Unfairly High Rates",
