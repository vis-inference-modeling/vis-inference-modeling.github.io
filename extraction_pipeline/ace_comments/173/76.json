  "raw_comment": "I noticed that no matter what the test scores show, legacy applicants have a higher rate of admission, and it appears that the best way a non-legacy student has to get into the elite college would be to come from a rich family. I wonder why legacy students have a higher admission rate, if a non-legacy student has a higher test score than it seems that they should have a better chance then a legacy student with a lower test score. This affects my community because there could be many students who have the potential to go to an elite college but might be waitlisted if there are many legacy students in that given year. A catchy headline could be \"Do legacy students deserve an advantage\"",
