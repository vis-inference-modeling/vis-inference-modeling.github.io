  "raw_comment": "What do you notice?\n\t\tI notice that without legacy status the more money your parents make the less of a chance that you will get admitted unless you are in the top 0.1%.  The trend does not completely carry over to legacy status students though.  Legacy status students acceptance rate generally increases the more their parents make and if you are in the top 0.1%, then your chances are about doubled.\nWhat do you wonder?\n\tI wonder how long this trend will continue.  I also wonder which colleges they got these statistics from.  \nHow does this relate to you and your community?\n\tI am a high school junior, so I wonder how this will impact me and my peers when we apply to colleges.\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\n\tParents make or break college admissions",
