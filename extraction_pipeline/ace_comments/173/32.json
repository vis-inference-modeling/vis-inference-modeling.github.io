  "raw_comment": "1. I noticed that those who come from higher income families are more likely to get accepted into elite colleges unlike those who come from poor families. From the graph, I can see that families with a legacy are also more likely to to get accepted.\n2. I wonder does this contribute to a greater cycle of higher income students who are able to get into elite colleges while those who come from poor families have a low chance of getting accepted. Is there any way to stop the cycle?\n3. This relates to me and my community because I feel like everyone should have an equal opportunity to get into elite colleges. There are people who would love to attend college but can’t due to the high costs or lack of resources. \n4. A name for the graph could be “College Admissions: An Unfair Advantage”",
