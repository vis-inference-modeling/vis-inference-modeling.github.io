  "raw_comment": "1. I notice that based on the graph the higher income a family has the higher the likelihood is of getting accepted into college. Meanwhile the lower the income a family may have the likelihood of getting accepted into college is lower. As well as any applicants with legacy's have up to 7 times the chance of getting accepted into college. While applicants without a legacy only are 2 times more chance of getting accepted into college.\n\n2. I wonder why colleges have a \"favorite\" with the higher income applicants, why should they be highly accepted while the low income applicants don't? At the end of the day both of the applicants are going to end up paying a similar amount of money at college. So, why not give an equal amount of chances to the applicants, since they are also similar if we look at it at an academic level.\n\n3. This relates to me and my community because for many people  in my town which include my family, we normally come from different countries and due to such reason  some families may not have a high income compared to others. But, any applicant should have the equal amount of probability of getting accepted into any college, since in order to get into college the only thing colleges should worry about applicants is their grades.\n\n4. Is The Education System Really Fair?",
