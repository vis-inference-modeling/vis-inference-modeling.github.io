This trend is shown throughout with the top 0.1% being 7x more likely to get in than someone with comparing attributes but no legacy.\n\n2. I wonder why the legacy of a applicant is so important and impactful when accepting people even when someone may be better yet without legacy.\n\n3. THis relates to my community because many people in my community are about to go to college and if this is a determining factor in admissions, this could cause some problems regarding college acceptance.\n4. \"The world of legacy, you are who you're born to.\" what getting in to college is really like now days.",
