If your notice makes a claim, where in the graph is the evidence to support it?\n\nThe higher income you have the more likely you are to be admitted. \n\nLegacy students have a much higher acceptance. \n\n2. What do you wonder?\n\nWhy does legacy matter? \n\nHow has this changed overtime?\nDoes this graph apply to other prestigious universities that aren't ivy Leagues?\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\n\nAs someone who is in the process of college applications, it highlights the unequal circumstances that admit students. These circumstances, income and legacy, are not things that people choose or do but are born into. This makes it impossible for other students to reach this same amount of admissions based on choice and decision alone. This makes the admission process just as biased and unfair as it has been in the past. \n\n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\n\nLegacy Boost: How Students who are legacies are more than 2x as likely to be admitted to elite universities\n\nThe higher the income, the higher the admission rate",
