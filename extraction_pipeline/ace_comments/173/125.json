  "raw_comment": "This graph shows the relationship between elite colleges and their tendency to choose applicants based on economic status and family legacy. The black line (legacy applicants) is significantly higher than the gray line (non-legacy applicants), indicating that elite schools favor legacy. Legacy applicants appear to automatically have double the chance of acceptance. It also is apparent that both types of applicants have a spiked chance of getting into an elite college when their parent’s income surpasses the 90th percentile. One thing that stood out to me was that applicants without legacy status who fall into the middle-class range have less of a chance of getting into an elite college versus an applicant with poorer or richer incomes. Do colleges discriminate against middle-class applicants because they are not rich enough to generate a lot of money but not poor enough to even out their statistics in appearing to be a school that caters to all financial statuses? This relates to me because as a current senior applying to college, I have had to witness students get into colleges just because of their legacy status and or because their parents have a higher income. Even though we may have the same statistics, colleges will always choose the legacy/richer applicant. This has hurt all students, not just me, and our disadvantage when it comes to being a middle class without legacy status when applying to elite colleges. \n\n“College: The Legacy of a Rich Man’s World!”",
