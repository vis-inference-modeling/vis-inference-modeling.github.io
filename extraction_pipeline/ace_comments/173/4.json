  "raw_comment": "I noticed that students with a higher income and legacy parents were more likely to be admitted. This could be for a variety of factors such as the fact that hire income families don't require scholarships and have access to more tutoring and educational resources, therefore getting better grades and more likely to give the school mor money. These reasons should not cause an equally hard working student with less resources, less connections, and less money, but of the same intelligence to not be admitted. Unfortunately this is not the case. It is also important to note that statistics can be very easily skewed and data is hard to collect 100% accurately so we still do not know the exact statistics and factors that go into these decisions.",
