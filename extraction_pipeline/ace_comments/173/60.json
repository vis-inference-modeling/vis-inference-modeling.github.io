  "raw_comment": "It's not fair that kids with lower amounts of money don't get to go to the Ivy League schools, even though kids with less money are just as smart as the rich kids. What if Ivy League schools take in only rich kids just cause of the money? That would be wasting space for someone that  could be a really smart student that is poorer. They should also do scholarships or programs for lower classed students.",
