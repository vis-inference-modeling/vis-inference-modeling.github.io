  "raw_comment": "I noticed that when applying for colleges, out of everyone with the exact same test score, legacy students are over twice as likely to be admitted. Furthermore, out of those legacy students, the children whose family has a higher income and makes more money are chosen above the others. A legacy student with a family income in the 99th percentile is 7x more likely to be admitted than the average student with the same test scores. \nI wonder why the colleges are prioritizing financial status when students apply for college. Why has our country’s education system turned away from helping educate students and form capable adults? Why is making more money a bigger priority than equality? I wonder how and if we can fix this inequality. Our country is based off of the idea of equal opportunity, and yet this is anything but equal. \nThis affects me as an upcoming senior looking into colleges. It is discouraging knowing that no matter how much I study, other students will still have an unfair advantage. This affects my research in which colleges I might apply to. Knowing I might have a better chance as a legacy student is unfair, but an advantage that some might not help but to exploit. Knowing this data is frustrating, yet it is an advantage to be well informed going into college searches. \n“College Acceptance : the turn from equality and opportunity to moneymaking and legacy”",
