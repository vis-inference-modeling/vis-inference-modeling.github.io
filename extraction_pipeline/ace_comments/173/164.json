It is obvious to anyone that the rate of admissions goes up exponentially once the income rank reaches above the 80th rank.  This may be caused by two things, either the school admits more students in higher income families because they believe the parents might make sizable donations to the school, or it is because more higher income families can afford to send their children to elite colleges and poorer families can't and do not apply.",
