Overall, students whose parents are in the top 5% of income rank have a much higher chance of admission.\n2. I wonder why there is a dip for non-legacy applicants between 75-90%.Is it legal to admit based off financial or legacy status? Is this true for non-elite colleges.\n3. I feel this is not fair as first-generational students would be at significant disadvantage. Ideally, educational opportunity should not be based off of factors out of your control. As someone whose parents did not go to elite colleges, this makes me even less confident if I apply.\n4. \"Who's applying: you or your parents?\"",
