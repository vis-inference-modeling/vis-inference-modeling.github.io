  "raw_comment": "I noticed that in the legacy area, someone who has a generation and history of people going to a specific league school has a higher chance of getting accepted than someone who does not have any legacies. Also, people in the upper class have a higher chance of being accepted and going to an Ivy League rather than those in the middle and lower class which is not out of the ordinary. This brings attention to the fact that just because someone is wealthier doesn't necessarily mean they are more advanced in education and talents.",
