In contrast, students in the 99th percentile without legacy are still twice as likely to get accepted\ninto the school. The only time the grey dips below the average is between the 75th and 90th percentile of\nearnings.\n2. I wonder why students without legacy who live in families with very high incomes have greater\nchances of getting into colleges, could it be other factors such as reputation?\n3. Many people in my community who apply to college must compete with other students who get a\nmassive boost simply by being the child of a former student. This is a major struggle for people working\nvery hard trying to achieve their dreams only to lose to the college system.\n4. \"Legacy and Luxury: The Admissions Advantage Unveiled in Elite Colleges\"",
