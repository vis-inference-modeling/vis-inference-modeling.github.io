  "raw_comment": "I noticed that whether a person is a legacy or not makes a huge difference for upper middle class people. It is the hardest for this group to get in without legacy. The acceptance chance for the super wealthy is much higher regardless of legacy or not, though significantly higher with legacy.\n\nI wonder why politicians are so concerned with the “unfair advantage“ that affirmative action gave when legacy acceptances are conveniently overlooked. “Shouldn’t we reward people based on their hard work and not luck of the draw?” A familiar argument used this past summer when affirmative action was overturned. But is being a person of color “luck of the draw”? Or is being a legacy, the majority of which are white, wealthy individuals not upholding systemic inequality?\n\nI know a lot of legacy students and a lot of students who have been admitted into top 20s/Ivies on merit. Most of the legacy students I know are white, privileged, and relatively less accomplished than those who aren’t. In no way am I saying that legacy students are not as smart or as talented, but there is a clear favor towards these students.\n\n“Lucky in Legacy: An Ivy’s four leaf clover”",
