  "raw_comment": "\"There ARE Advantages in Elite College Admissions!\"\n\nStudents whose parents' incomes are in the top 5% are far more likely to be admitted into a prestigious university.  Interestingly, students whose parents are in the 70-95th percentile get accepted less frequently.  Additionally, legacy applicants are far more likely to be admitted.  I wonder why universities care so much about the students' wealth in the admission process.  This means that students from low-income households and/or are first-generation college students are at a disadvantage.  Some universities are becoming need-blind and offering resources for first-generation college students to excel after high school.",
