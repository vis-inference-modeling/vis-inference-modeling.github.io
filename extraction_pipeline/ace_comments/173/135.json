What I notice is that the higher the student's parent income is, the more likely they are to get accepted to college, while people who have a lower income are less likely to be accepted to college. I also recognize how leacy helps students get accepted, as for those who do not have it, they get under the average admission rate.\n2. I wonder how far does having a higher income take you. For instance, if you are rich but you do not meet the college requirements, will they still accept you for your income as if you have a lower income but you meet all the requirements?\n3. This is relevant to my community because it contributes to social inequality by limiting educational opportunities for those who have a lower income. It's not fair that just because you have a higher income, you mostly get accepted to college compared to someone who struggles financially. This creates an environment where success is tied to a higher income.\n4. \"The Secret to Instant Admission Revealed!\"",
