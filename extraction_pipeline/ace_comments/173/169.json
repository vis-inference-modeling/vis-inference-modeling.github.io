The wealthier the student, the more likely they will be admitted based on the large spike at the end of both lines.\n\n2. I wonder what other factors go into determining a prime admission candidate.\n\n3. This impacts me especially because I am currently applying to college and have few legacy connections with the schools that I am interested in.\n \n4.
