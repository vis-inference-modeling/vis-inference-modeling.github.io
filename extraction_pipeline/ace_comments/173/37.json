  "raw_comment": "I noticed that applicant who have had their parents or siblings go to an Elite college along with a substantially large income would be accepted much faster than a scholar who doesn't have  those \"requirements\". This may be, a legacy applicant may have someone who exceeding very well and choosing the safer option would benefit the schools Elite status as well as keeping bonds with these families.\n\nI wonder, how likely are the chances for a legacy applicant to be turned down at an Elite college? Also what are the chances that a regular applicant would be chosen over a legacy applicant?\n\nThis relates and differs to me because at my high school there are blended income rates along with the same opportunities and  the same education. \n\nA Headline can be \" Are the same opportunities given to everyone?\"",
