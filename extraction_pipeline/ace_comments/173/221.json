  "raw_comment": "Notice: I notice that near the 85th percentile of income the advantage goes down, so it seems like it would be even harder to get into college if your parents were in that income bracket. That seems weird to me.\nWonder: I wonder how the data would vary if only collected from one college. I wonder if certain colleges are more likely biased by income or legacy.\nRelation: This relates to me and my community because it changes the chances/advantages my community gets. Many people in the bay area will get higher advantage of getting into college because the average income rate in the bay area is higher. \nTitle: \"Socioeconomic bias in education isn't going anywhere\"",
