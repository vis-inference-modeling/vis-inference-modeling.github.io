  "raw_comment": "I notice that the the richer your parents are and you have a legacy in your family the graph rises exponetially. The top 50% have a 300% increase in their chances of getting in, and the top 0.1% have a 700% increase in their chances of admission compared to a less wealthy legacy student. \n\nI wonder if the reason they do this is becuase the rich legacy parents donate a lot of money to the school and if there child gets accepted there they will be inclined to donate more money to the school. \n\nThis relates to my community becuase many people applying to colleges that have the grades and extracireculars and deserve the ability to go to a good ivy league school are going to miss out on an oppertunity becuause someone has rich legacy parents. \n\nHeadline: What are colleges really looking for in an application: rich legacy parents!",
