  "raw_comment": "1. I notice the extreme boost in odds of admission for legacy applicants and for some reason a boost for kids with parts in the top 1-5%. I also notice there isn’t my change based on income at any point below the top 5%. Finally I notice that strangely income has a much greater effect for legacy applicants than it does for normal applicants. \n2. I wonder why there is such a difference between normal and legacy applicants as you would expect the college to accept the best applicants and not those with parents who went there previously. I also wonder how income can affect admissions so greatly, I wonder if it is because they have more support to build a better application or if it's actually part of the admissions calculations. Finally I wonder why income hurts your chances as a normal applicant (until top 5ish percent) though it boosts your chances as a legacy applicant. \n3. Admission to college is very important to me and to many other students in my community. The majority of us are not legacy applicants and if there is truly this great disadvantage that comes with this fact it would greatly damage the hopes of many students in my district. Additionally my district is very split on parents' financial status and truly this shouldn’t be affecting admissions as I don’t think the most supported kids are very often the smartest or hardest working students. \n4.
