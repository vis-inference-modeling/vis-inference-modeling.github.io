I also notice that the students with legacies have much higher chances of getting into collage, which is very unfair for students trying to be the first in their family to attend collage. \n2. I wonder why students who have parents with higher income rates are more likely to be admitted into these collages. \n3. In our community today, there are many people trying to become the first in their family to attend collage, and this graph shows that those people are much less likely to get into a good collage. \n4. The Rigged Collage Admission System",
