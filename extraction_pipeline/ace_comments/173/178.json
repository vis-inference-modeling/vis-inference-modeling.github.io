I also notice that the extremely wealthy legacies, ie; the 0.1 percentile are nearly 7x more likely to be accepted. Considering that elite colleges have an acceptance rate of about 3.3% to 7.3%, the acceptance rate for rich legacies is about 23.1% to 51.1%. This is important because traditionally, people who go to elite colleges are more likely to be rich in the future. The boost given to wealthy people and to legacies is meant to keep the class divide obvious and the school selective. \n \n2)\nI wonder if this legacy boost exists in every single college. What would happen if each college had an individual graph plotting the difference between legacy and non-legacy? Does this bias go on to affect other things at the college, like grades, clubs, etc? Why is there a dip in the graph at around 50th and below the 90th?  What is it about these top 0.1 percentile legacies that makes colleges so incredibly drawn to them?\n\n3)\nThis relates to my and my community because I am planning to go to college one day, and being a middle class non-legacy, it feels discouraging to apply to Ivy League and other elite schools. And even if I were to get accepted into these schools, many of the people I would be attending with would also be extremely wealthy, leading to a difference in experience and in values. \n\n4)\n\"Are You Rich? Are You a Legacy? Welcome to Harvard!\"",
