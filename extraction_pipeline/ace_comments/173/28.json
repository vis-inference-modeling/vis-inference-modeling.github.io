  "raw_comment": "I am sick and tired of hearing about the Ivy League. For the last 47 years, I have taught at one of the top public unis in the world and I have had grad students from the Ivy League. Their privilege has been nauseating. They have had so many things handed to them and can not work well in health care. On average, they have been sheltered and can not tolerate stress well. I find it especially amusing that Duke, or Fluke, is mentioned here. Many of their faculty live hand to mouth, on grant funding. The school is so cheap, it will not even pay their salaries. It breeds an unhealthy environment, to say nothing of  insufferable humidity.",
