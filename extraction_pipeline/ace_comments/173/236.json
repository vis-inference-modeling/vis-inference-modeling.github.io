Also what purpose does putting the y-axis on the right as opposed to the left have? \n\nRelates to me and my community: Many colleges are similar to the Elite ones in this data even if they aren't in the limelight for this particular graph. To some extent you can guess that this may apply to most if not all schools and that will affect college choices that are considered and what school counselors and teachers tell their students about where they should apply and where they might not get in for one reason or another.\n\nHeadline: Legacy and Income: How these 2 factors can change whether you get into your top college or not",
