That doesn't mean you won't be accepted though.\n \nI Wonder: why it is so important to schools that there is a legacy? \n\nA way this relates to my community: My community is composed of mainly immigrants meaning most if not all of them have no education. They also come from other countries meaning they have no legacy in the country they are currently living in. This affects their children because if they want to apply to an elite college their chances are slim. \n\nHeadline: Legacy and Money are IMPORTANT to Elite colleges",
