  "raw_comment": "I noticed that legacy applicants had more than double the advantage of being admitted into college compared to non-legacy students. I also noticed that up until the 99.9 percentile, the graph stays kind of flat, but then it suddenly grows for both legacy and non-legacy students. The 99.9 percentile of legacy applicants have more than 6x the advantage compared to the average. Still, the 99.9 percentile of non-legacy applicants has around the same advantage or less than the poorer legacy applicants. \n\nI wonder why they value legacy students more than even the rich non-legacy students. I also wonder how different the admission process is for non-legacy, legacy, rich, and poor. \n\nIt relates to me because a lot of people think that whether you go to college or not is a very important determinant of your future. As someone who wants to go to college, seeing these kinds of statistics can be discouraging, as you know someone else will be considered first in line matter what you do, especially if you are not a legacy applicant. \n“Elite Colleges Have Preferences”",
