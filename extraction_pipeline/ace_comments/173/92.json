  "raw_comment": "One thing I noticed was the fact that the chances of being admitted increases dramatically increase for those with richer and legacy parents, and this increased the divide between students.\nSomething I wondered was when did tracking the parents legacy become so important? And how people without a legacy can combat this disadvantage? \nThe divide between students with or without a legacy brings up a certain inequality that people haven't talked about, especially since the graph shows how difficult it is, even for the richer people to be admitted without a legacy. I feel legacy shouldn't matter especially since it is some students can't control. \nPossible heading: \"Legacy: how it controls the student's chances in college\"",
