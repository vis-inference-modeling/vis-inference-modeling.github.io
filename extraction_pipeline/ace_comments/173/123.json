  "raw_comment": "The graph depicts the likelihood of legacy applicants to be admitted into elite colleges, in comparison to those with the same test scores and no legacy advantage. As the parents’ income increases, so does the estimated legacy boost. For example, a legacy student with parents who rank in the top 0.1% of income is 7x more likely to be admitted into a school. I wonder why there is less of a legacy boost for students with parents below the 50th percentile of income rank. Perhaps the ability of the wealthier to donate a greater amount of money impacts the graph. The effect of financial aid could be another possible explanation for this. This graph impacts my community because my peers and I recently applied to college. It shows us that if we have similar academic statistics to another individual, but lack a legacy status, we are at a disadvantage for admissions. I would title this graph: “The Legacy Advantage.”",
