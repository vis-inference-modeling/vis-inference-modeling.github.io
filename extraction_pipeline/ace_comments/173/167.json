If your notice makes a claim, where in the graph is the evidence to support it?\n\nI noticed that the higher percentile of income, and whether or not you were a legacy applicant greatly affected your probability of getting in. And when you are in the 99th percentile, you are practically  guaranteed to get in.\n\n2. What do you wonder?\n\nI wonder why the graph is so heavily skewed toward the rich, I wonder if there are systems that could be put in place to remedy this imbalance. \n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\n\nThis has a great impact on me and my community as we are all currently applying to college, and this graph goes to show the unfair advantage the rich have in accessing education.\n\n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\n\nThe rich get richer: how the wealthy monopolize elite education",
