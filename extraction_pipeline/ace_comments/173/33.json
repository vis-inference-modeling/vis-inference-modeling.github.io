And if they would still have been admitted just by having a higher income.\n3)this relates to my community since we are in a lower income community because the looks of it can affect our acceptance in some colleges. and the people who have applied to elite colleges may be harder because they don't have the same resources as someone with a higher income may have.\n4)money may be the answer to getting into elite colleges",
