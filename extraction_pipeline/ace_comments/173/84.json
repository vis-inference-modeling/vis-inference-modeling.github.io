  "raw_comment": "I notice that there is a legacy boost in elite colleges, meaning that if a parent or sibling goes there you have a much higher chance of getting into that college. I noticed that students who are wealthier, have a greater chance of getting admitted as well. \nI wonder why having a parent or sibling that previously went to that college makes a effect on whether or not a student gets admitted or not, because shouldn’t the college be focusing on you, not others? \nThis relates to me and my community, because I am currently a senior making college decisions, and my chances may be lower or higher than other people just based on a family legacy. \nWhat’s going on in this graph is that it is showing the effects of how legacy and wealth contribute to one’s chance of being admitted into college. A catchy headline would be: If You Have A Legacy, it is Your Legacy To Come To College!",
