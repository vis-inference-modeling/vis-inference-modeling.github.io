If your notice makes a claim, where in the graph is the evidence to support it?\n\nI notice that legacy applicants have a higher advantage of getting in even if they are on the poorer side but the wealthier legacy applicants have the most advantage. \n\n2. What do you wonder?\n\nI wonder why the legacy applicants have a higher advantage of getting in than non legacy applicants. I also wonder which schools they picked like did they only pick the Ivy league schools or state schools as well. \n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\n\nThis has an impact on my community because it affects the students that have worked hard to apply for these schools and get pushed aside for the wealthy legacy applicants. \n\n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\n\nMoney is a necessity, Legacy is a perk when applying to colleges",
