  "raw_comment": "I noticed that students with parents who have a higher income are more likely to be accepted. While the bottom 50% are about 3x as likely to be accepted, while it climbs quite tremendously in the top 50%. It escalates to the summit where the top 0.1% are 7x more likely to be admitted. I also noticed that without a legacy boost, the top 0.1% has about the same chance to get in as the bottom 10% with a legacy boost. I wonder if this happens because kids with wealthier parents have more money for better education. I also wonder if it has to do with dropping out because of mental illness which can be more common in poorer accommodations. This relates to me and my community because while I go to a school that offers scholarships and is welcoming no matter how wealthy the family is, I know many people don't live like that. Many students get bullied for how much or little money they have. This graph shows the bias in our community toward the wealthy, often because they are able to afford a better education. While people may think that that's fair, it's not really because the parents of these children likely work just as long if not longer than the top 0.1%. The difference is that the top 0.1% was able to make a money harvesting company that the lower class people may not have been able to do because of the bias in society. To sum up, we have a bias in our community because of poverty status\nHeadline: College Admission: How do they show the bias in our community?",
