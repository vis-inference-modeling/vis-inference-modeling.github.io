The legacy is more likely to be accepted and provides an advantage. \n2)I'm curious how the graph might vary based on the year it was created. Additionally, I'm curious as to why the income 10th percentile is above normal while the 75th to 90th percentiles are below.\n3)Since there aren't many extremely wealthy people in our area—roughly 99.5%—I believe that being accepted into a prestigious institution requires a high level of education and intelligence. Not many people can also claim to have parents who attended elite schools in the past. \n4)Does the rate of admittance increase with income?",
