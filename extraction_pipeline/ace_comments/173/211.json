  "raw_comment": "I've noticed that, despite college missions departments' claims to the contrary, legacy applicants and parental income have a significant impact on applications. As the information about your parents' making expands, so does the gray region that separates the non-legacy line (bottom and grey) from the legacy line (top and black).\nI'm curious as to why the graph exhibits a slight decrease at the 90th percentile of wealth. It makes sense that the admittance rate would rise with wealth, at least based on my educated prediction in the previous question. \nThis is relevant to both my town and myself because I know many individuals, including myself, who are always applying to colleges, and there are several prestigious universities in the area that might be prejudiced in their selection process at the moment because of things like legacy status and financial means.\nThe Reality of How Rigged The College Admission Process Is",
