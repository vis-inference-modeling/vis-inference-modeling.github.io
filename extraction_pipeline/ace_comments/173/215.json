Those systemic barriers being the legacy boost during college admissions- especially to top selective universities. This graph is appalling by the means which it keeps the less fortunate less fortunate; and, the rich richer via generational wealth and nepotism. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why these colleges still implement legacy boosts during the college admissions process. I wonder what benefit do these universities get by preferring legacy students? Also, how does legacy boost- in addition to affirmative action- completely deplete the middle class’ chance of attending an elite university?\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nResiding in a rural area I and my fellow peers would most likely be unable to attend an elite university due to the systemic boost of legacy admits- which many legacies attend wealthy private schools. Additionally, we might also not have the different resources for the criterion of admissions at elite universities- which wealthy private schools might have readily available. \n\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\nSystemic barriers captivating colleges: Legacies leading admission",
