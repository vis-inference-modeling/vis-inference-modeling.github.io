  "raw_comment": "I notice that according to the graph the children who come from the top 0.1% of wealth in America are 7 times more likely to be admitted in elite colleges.  I wonder if the mode for the poor population of students are targeted by colleges or if its just by chance. For the poor population the 30th percentile mark has the highest chance to be admitted to a college. The chance proceeds to decline before and after that percentile only ascending again when it goes to the 70th percentile. This relates to me and my community because many people in Perth Amboy come from the lower financial side. It is very discouraging to realize that even though my peers and I are very educated and intelligent our application to elite colleges are looked differently than of an application that comes from wealth. \nColleges Care About your $$$$",
