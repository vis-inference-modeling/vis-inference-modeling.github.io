  "raw_comment": "I noticed that there is a significant gap between the legacy boost and the estimated advantage without the legacy boost. Even without the legacy boost the graph shows that when you are in the 99.9 percentile of your parents' income rank, you are still around 3x more likely to be accepted into an IV school. \n\nI wonder if students ever have an issue with this and sometimes feel that they just got into these schools because of their parents. I feel like I would feel that I didn't deserve to be there and I would want to get into the school on my own. I also wonder if the parents will notice this and begin to do something about it or if they just do not care enough. \n\nThis relates to me because I will be soon applying to colleges and it is interesting to learn more about statistics. It is interesting to learn that my community is middle-upper class and that diminishes our chances of getting into an IV league school. It is kind of frustrating to learn that income is a part of being accepted into college, while it should be about your education levels and many other things not including your parents' income. \n\nWhat Do Colleges Really Think About When Looking At Applications? Is it Rigged?",
