  "raw_comment": "I noticed that elite colleges pay attention to a whole lot more than your grades and test scores. They look at how rich your parents are or how poor. Also, they look at if they have gone to their school or any elite school before. Depending on those results you may be more or less likely to be accepted. \n\nI wonder why they base their decisions based off of parental income and where their parents went. What does that do with the current kid? Are we really just going to trash his application based off of a background he or she has absolutely no control over?\n\nThis relates heavily to me because I am a student with grades applicable to elite colleges and schools and knowing that they are going to base my acceptance based on our income amount and where my parents went to school can be a very important thing to consider. Knowing I am already at a disadvantage because of that makes me realize just how much harder I and many other students in the same situation have to work to get ahead of these other more privileged students.\n\nElite Schools Throwing Away Elite Applicants for Family Legacies.",
