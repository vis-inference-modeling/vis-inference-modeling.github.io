  "raw_comment": "I notice that this is a line graph where the dots between the lines represent parents' income rank. The black line is average admissions rate for legacy applicants, while the gray line represents the general admissions rate for non-legacy applicants. I also notice that for the both, you are more likely to get in if you are rich, even though rich legacy applicants still have a boost over everyone else. I wonder why the graph dips near the 90th parents' income rank and how these students' race, gender, and ethnicities, etc. and how that plays into their admissions rate/advantage. The graph's message is that legacy students' are generally more likely to be accepted into top colleges, especially if their parents are rich. \nA catchy headline/title is \"Cha-Ching!$ The big bucks help you get into college, as well as your fam (loved ones) who attended the college you want.\"",
