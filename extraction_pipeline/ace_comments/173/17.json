I can say that I'm already fortunate enough to have grown up privileged and never \"poor\", but nevertheless, I am far from \"rich\" in terms of income rank, and according to this graph, that will also unfortunately affect my chances of being accepted into more elite and prestigious colleges. \n\nCatchy Headline: Smarts or Status?: Advantages of Legacy & Affluent Applicants \n\nPt. 2- Questions 3 & 4",
