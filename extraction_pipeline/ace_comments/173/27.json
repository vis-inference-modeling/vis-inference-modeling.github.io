  "raw_comment": "It doesn't seem to have occurred to anyone that the most prestigious colleges are that way because of who they admit, and changing that is not going to give an advantage to those who were formerly not admitted, but will simply make these schools no longer prestigious.\n\nThat is, it is plausible that Harvard graduates are desirable because Harvard screens its applicants for desirability, not because of the education they get once they are there. It's a similar fallacy for all highly selective schools - if a school only allows in the best students (for whatever meaning of best you like), the school and it's teachers don't have to be any good, because the best students will excel regardless.",
