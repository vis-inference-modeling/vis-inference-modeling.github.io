  "raw_comment": "I notice that this graph shows how much of an advantage wealthy legacy children have for getting into the country's top \"prestigious\" colleges. I notice that your parent's income has a big pull on your chances of acceptance. I wonder if schools will start to defer or reject more legacy to make it more fair for other applicants who are more deserving. This relates to me and my community because many of my friends including myself our top schools were schools our siblings or parents had attended. I have grown very familiar with this process over the past few months as a senior in high school. I have started to hear of a lot more legacies getting deferred in the early action applicant pool and being moved to regular decisions. \nHeadline:\nIs the college application process as fair as we think??",
