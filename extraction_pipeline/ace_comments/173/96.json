  "raw_comment": "1. I noticed that legacy applicants are automatically more likely to get in to an ivy league school without being of a higher income rank. I also noticed that many people with higher income ranks in the 80-85% range have a significantly lower advantage without a legacy.\n2. Why do kids with higher parental income with no legacy have a lower chance of getting in? Shouldn't the colleges want money? Do legacy applicants with less amount of money get in due to scholarships or high academic performance. What is the age gap of the applicant relatives? Do colleges asks for you parents' income when you are filling out your application?\n3. It relates to me and my community because as a junior in high school, it is interesting to see what colleges are looking for from their applicants, and if they look at your amount of money or your academic performance?\n4. \"College Applicants: You Cant be Too Rich\"",
