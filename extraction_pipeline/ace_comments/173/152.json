If your notice makes a claim, where in the graph is the evidence to support it?\n\nThis graph demonstrates the likelihood of acceptance to an elitist college by comparing factors including wealth and whether the student is a legacy, all with the same test scores. It shows that being a legacy immediately gives one an advantage no matter their current social status but also that as they become wealthier their chances increase with the top 0.1% being 7 times more likely to be accepted. \n\n2. What do you wonder?\n\nI wonder why there are a few dips in the graph, especially right around the 0.5% middle class and the people right before the top 0.1%. What makes them less likely to be accepted?\n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\n\nThis impacts me and my community because me and my classmates are currently applying to college. It's important that we understand the hidden factors that inflounce our acceptance apart from our test scores. \n\n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\n\nIs being a legacy no longer a promise of acceptance? \n\nTop 0.1% fueling their own success, is being wealthy the real deciding factor in college acceptances?",
