  "raw_comment": "I noticed that as your parent's income rank increases, the better chance you have at getting accepted. I also noticed that the legacy applicants have more than double the shot at getting in, rather than the non-legacy students. Taking another look at the 90th rank and beyond, we see that there is a dip in acceptance and then a 7x increase. I know that people at either end of the graph have greater chances of attending because of diversity applicants and federal grant applicants, while juxtaposing that idea, the elite rich love to seperate themselves from others so the right side of the graph is not unexpected. \nI wonder if other colleges at local and community levels would have similar looking graphs? What about on the international level? I wonder if we did this survey again in 10 years would we yield the same results? \nThis impacts my community because my friends and I are not legacies and yet some of them try so much harder, it's hard to know that students would be chosen over them just based on famialial history. \n\"Colleges are the new alabama, Keeping it in the family\"",
