When asked if the world is getting better with each generation, youth ages 15-24 seemed more optimistic than the 40+ especially within ‘first world' countries such as the US, UK, Japan and Germany. Only 3 of 20 countries have older generations who believe the world is improving which leads me to wonder if countries not mentioned believe it’s not improving at all. I wonder if people between ages 15-24 will have a different mindset as time goes on since the world keeps changing and what factors contribute to the populace’s perception on whether the world is becoming a better place. This relates to me and my community since I’m part of the youth and am surrounded by my age group at school but also have older cultured parents and family so I can see the different mindsets first hand between the youth and the older generation. I have noticed that older generations seem to make generalizations about the younger generations and that there is a common agreement among each side with many people between ages 15-24 finding themselves in line with each other about feeling the world being a better place as we progressively move forward with each generation.

Additionally, I noticed that there are many different countries with ranging economic, social and political statuses that participated in this survey.\n\nI wonder how much the graph would change if every country in the world was included. Has the economic status affected these results? What was the reason for Indonesia and Mali having the highest/lowest results? What was the reason for young adults believing that the world is getting better with each generation?\n\nThis relates to me and my community because my age group is included in this graph. It’s interesting to see how optimistic the 15-24 age group is compared to the 40+ age group.\n\nThe graph depicts people ages 15-24 and 40+ and how they responded to the question that the world is becoming better/worse with each generation. A catchy headline I came up with was “How Optimistic is Your Generation?”",

In the graph we can see the percentages in each country separated by ages 15-24 and 40+. There are only 3 countries that the older generations believe the world is improving which leads me to believe that in the countries not mentioned they believe it is not improving at all.

In twelve of the twenty one surveyed countries, over 50% of youths (ages 15-24) demonstrated optimistic views. Adults, on the other hand, reported positive attitudes towards the future in only six countries. 2) The glaring question is why do older generations have a generally more negative mindset, while younger generations envision brighter futures? I wonder what factors contribute to the populace’s perception on wether the world is becoming a better place? Bie B. Sea from Taihu lake cited significant economic growth in Indonesia to account for its overall positivity. Nicky from Wuxi, China conjectured that societal pressures (for example the stresses of the education system) lead to negative outlooks. 3) I believe this information is very relevant to my community. In my speculation, growth mindsets are fundamental to progress. Positivity is an essential part of any healthy society, helping to motivate, inspire, and encourage its populace.

The majority of adults (ages 40 and older) who were surveyed, demonstrated an overall positive mindset in only six of the twenty one countries.

The US is one of the farthest points away from the line, with a positive residual, meaning that more young people think the world is getting better, and less older people do. I wonder if what the world was like as the older people were growing up shaped how they feel about future generations - they might be negative because newer ideas and concepts that they are not used to are surfacing, and many people do not like change.\nI wonder what other countries' data looks like - is there a specific reason that they chose to only survey/include these countries? If they included other countries, this graph might look completely different. I also wonder about the ages in between - how do 25-39 year olds feel about the world?\nThis relates to me and my community because I am in the younger generation, and I'm surprised at how positive so many young people are, because it often feels like the opposite.\n\nTitle: The World - Half Full or Half Empty?",

Both countries have such vast changes with the younger groups' beliefs compared to the older. I wonder why these specific two countries have the largest differences. I also wonder why Indonesia's percentages are so high up for both groups, having over 75% for both. This relates to me and my community because my country, the U.S is part of this poll taken and my age is also considered in the graph, so it's interesting to see how my own generations view our progress of bettering the world. A title appropriate for this graph would be \"Each Generations' Thoughts on the Bettering of the World.\"",

There were no significant outliers that had the opposite relationship. I also noticed that the differential between the two was greatest in countries that had relatively low population growth rates, like the United States and Japan. I learned in my human geography class that relationships like that can end out exacerbating issues for the older dependent population. I wonder if potentially that is one of the reasons why older people tend to have a more pessimistic viewpoint on where society is headed. I also wonder why some countries, like Indonesia, were so overwhelmingly positive in their views across the board, but some countries were overall very negative. I think it likely is influenced by the situation of internal affairs within that country. I’m not familiar with the political systems of each country here, but I think it’s also plausible for that to have a significant impact on people’s world views.

After stating the first impressions of the data collected in the graph my primary observation is that the overall mean percentage of the 15- to 24-year-olds who say that the world is getting better with each generation is higher than 50% whereas the mean percentage of the 40+ year-olds who say that the world is getting better is lower than 50%. The analysis of this data can bring to the spotlight the fact that older generations may have already felt that their contribution towards a more developed and \"brighter\" future wasn't enough or that more recent generations would not be able to receive better life conditions when comparing themselves with the newer generations. This type of feeling could increase depression rates and a more rather negative outlook towards humanities's future. On the other hand, the data expresses and illustrates how the younger generations are more optimistic about the world's situation heading to future generations as well. Younger perspectives when discussing the future can surely extract more hope and greater future aspirations to bring to the world in order to expand aspect in which the human race can improve upon. Indonesia is a clear example of this, as it is the most optimistic country with both age ranges assuming that the world is getting better with each generation.

This graph confuses me because it doesn’t really send a message or show a general trend for different country types, the only thing I really noticed was that there were more African and Asian countries that both had higher group percentages compared to European and South American countries. I’m curious as to why the author of this graph has chosen to only choose 21 countries and didn’t include a lot of age groups- because 15 year olds and 24 year olds are very very different people. It’s a very small data set too, with only 21,000 people taken in all of the countries. This graph relates to my community because there’s a stigma in my community and my country that more recent generations are “more lazy” than older generations, which might be the cause of the very low percentage of 40  year olds thinking the generations have been getting better. \n\nDoes geography change the different generation’s views on each other?",

      "raw_comment": "The graph showing plots of multiple countries and their older and younger population answering one question is the world getter better with each generation. I immediately noticed that the younger generations are a lot more optimistic than the older generation. The US for example has more than 50 percent of their 15-24 year olds believing that the world is getting better with each generation while less than 50 percent of the 40  year old believe the same thing. I am wondering based on this data could the political swing of one generation also be affecting their ideas about the future. In addition, could there be a discrepancy in what the older versus what younger populations believe is better for the world. This data is important and affects both my community and I due to the fact that the optimism in a community is really important when trying to advocate for anything. The large gap presented in the graph indicates that there are major differences between what the older and younger generations believe is better for the world. That is going to cause some tensions in a community such as mine if the discussion of differences is not addressed properly.

For example, a 50-year-old who has probably lived their childhood and adolescence without phones and computers and the internet might be more opposed to it than a 15-year-old who has probably lived most of their life with phones and the internet. I also wonder if older generations are generally more pessimistic or if they are just pessimistic towards the future of the world.

However there are some countries like Indonesia, India, and Nigeria who have relatively even numbers of people, young and old, who think that the world is getting better. I wonder why higher percentages of people in less developed countries say the world is getting better. Does it have anything to do with the fact that they see their own lack of development and then they see how the world around them has many improvements, and perceive improvements from around the world as much greater things than people from more developed countries might perceive them? This graph poses many questions about perspective, especially with the topic of improvement being very perspective based. This relates to my community because I am part of the younger generation, so it is very uplifting to see that large amounts of young people have very positive outlooks on the world.

It shows how younger people, on average, have a more positive mindset towards the way that the world has turned out.\nThe style of this graph is a scatter plot. The variables are the responses of the younger people and the responses of the older people. It shows a moderate correlation between young people and more positive responses towards the world's growing conditions. \nI feel that the audience intended for this graph are sociocultural and brain development professionals. From a psychological standpoint, this audience may be able to use this information to see the differences that different cultures' cognitive processes, regarding optimism, differ with age.\nI think the purpose is to show the difference in cognition between different societies and ages. As younger people seem to have a more positive mindset, there may be a developmental stage during 15-24 years old that could impact your mindset. In addition, differences in culture can play a role in the differences in mental development.",

      "raw_comment": "The first thing I noticed is how 'Young' people tend to lean towards the idea of \"the world is getting better with each generation\"  more than 'older' people. As in the graph, you can see that most of the 15 - 24-year-olds in the provided countries fall between the 50-75% range, with none under 25%. However, when looking at the Y-axis for people over the age of 40, most countries fall below 50%, and have a significant amount under 25%. \n\nThere is not exactly a noticeable trend among the data, however you do notice that most of the '1st world' countries have a much higher 'optimistic' younger population than an older one. As you can see in the graph, the US, UK, Japan and Germany are all within the 50-75% range on the X-axis (younger people believing the world is getting better), meanwhile on the Y-axis (Older people believing that the world is getting better) all the previously mentioned countries fall below the 50% mark. \n\nThere is an anomaly within this result, which would be Indonesia, as both the younger and older generations agree that the world is getting better as time goes on. This is likely due to the fact that Indonesia's economy has increased by over 600% since the year 2000, this would obviously see a great increase in the quality of life and general welfare of the populace. Under such conditions, it is quite understandable why Indonesia's population generally have such 'high hopes' for the future.",

This makes me wonder if the younger age group believes this because they are closer in age to the younger newer generations and grew up in a similar fashion. Rather the older groups have the opposite opinion of the younger generations not being better because they grew up much differently then the older generation. Meaning, they might have different morals or beliefs than the other generation therefore making it difficult for them to understand how the younger generation is being raised.

But except for three countries, young people in other countries will be more optimistic about the development of the world than the elderly. But according to a psychological survey by UC Davis, 51 is the peak of optimism, but it doesn't seem to show this in this chart. This raises my question: is this data reliable enough? What is the specific age of the person who answered this question? But when we assume that the data of this questionnaire is reliable, a very interesting question arises. Can an optimistic attitude towards the development of the world really show that this person is an optimistic person? Because in my opinion, this is a very objective problem. I am in China because the epidemic protection is very strict. In China, entering shopping malls or some public areas requires a QR code to prove that they are healthy, but many middle-aged and elderly people are rejected because they don't have mobile phones or can't use them. This will make them feel abandoned, abandoned by the world. This is just a small example, but when we re-examine this chart, I believe everyone will have the answer.",

I also notice that they surveyed about 1,000 people from each of the countries listed.\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder how accurate this graph truly is. Considering that they are using 1,000 people to represent countries filled with millions upon millions of people, the margin of error has to be pretty large. I also wonder how much the generational effect holds true. This graph would go to prove how people that have seen more have less optimism, but I wonder why there are so many 15-24 year olds that are hopeless for the future generations. \nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to me and my community for I fit into the 15-24 year old category and am a member of Gen Z. If I were asked the same question, I would likely say that the world is not getting better with each generation because of certain things I have learned over the years.

I also noticed that Indonesia has such a high percentage of people that think in both directions. It's important to know that younger people are more optimistic about future generations rather than the old people. I think that old people just think younger generations are annoying and unpatriotic, while younger people read history books and see how there were wars and bad things going on previously to their generation. I wonder why some countries are not very optimistic and some are. Is it the number of old people in a country, the economic stability, or is it something else? This relates to me and my community because being optimistic about our future generations is very important, and in the U.S. we are pretty optimistic mainly in the younger ages.

We wonder what makes younger people think more postively about the world and why the older generation thinks so negatively. Also, we wonder what the older people see as the negatives about the world and what the youngers see so postive. The impact we think affects us is because we, ourselves, are apart of the 15-24 year olds.",

I also noticed that Indonesia overall has a much higher rating of people saying the world gets better with every generation and this was across the board for ages surveyed. I also observed that the closer each country's dot was to the black line, the more the two age groups agreed with the other. For example, Morocco, Nigeria, and India all show that these two groups have the relative same consensus. I saw that about 21,000 and up people have been interviewed in each country by phone. I wonder if certain areas of these countries have different overall opinions and if they contrast from those in different areas. Also, if the survey was conducted only by telephone it could impact the results of the people being surveyed if many people in a country do not have access to a phone.

We also noticed that country’s socioeconomic condition didn’t determine its belief on if the world is getting better. There was great variation across all countries with different socioeconomic conditions. Why were these countries chosen when some of them are really small and some of them are very big? Why did they choose certain age groups from certain countries but not evaluate both age groups in the countries? The graph displays that about 65% of the US views each generation is improving.

This is interesting because it shows how the younger generation has more optimism for themselves compared to older generations. This could be because of a bias towards themselves for both groups. The younger people have more confidence within their own generation. Whereas the older people believe that they are better at managing the world.\n\nI wonder what specifically gave the people of Indonesia the confidence in their younger generation compared to the rest of the world. With the percentage overall being much higher compared to all other countries, I wonder if there is a specific cause to this statistic.\n\nThis relates to my community because I have noticed that much of the older generation in my community is much more hesitant towards being confident in the younger generation for the future compared to the young people themselves.

I wonder why some countries are really high in 15-24 year olds thinking the owls dis getting better but the 40+ year olds think the world isn’t getting better, why the drastic difference?\n3.  It’s relates to me because I am part of a generation and their is also the generation from the people below me, so we all expect them to help the world too,  and they should help make it so that people do think the world is getting better within each generation.\n4.

I noticed in the graph that typically the younger generations had more optimism. This is because the majority of the 15-24 year old responses in the graph were above the line that was used to show how similar the younger and older adults' answers were for each country. For example, India's point is very close to the line, which therefore shows that India's adolescents and older adults have a very similar response. Along with this information, I also noticed that the countries with the highest optimism were countries that are still developing and are continuously growing and improving. I wonder why Brazil and Mali are so low on the graph. I also wonder what determines levels of optimism. I want to know why adults are generally less optimistic. Could this be because they have more life experience and have more realistic expectations? This relates to me and my community because I am in high school and I  live in the United States. I would say that the information in the graph accurately reflects my country. A good title for this graph could be: \"Country Optimism Through the Ages\"",

This graph depicts many more countries such as Brazil, Japan, the US and Zimbabwe showing 15-24 year olds saying the world gets better with each generation. On the opposing side, few countries such as Nigeria, India and Morocco have adults over the age of 40 agreeing the world gets better with each generation. Within theses graphs you can also see the percentage of people that are in agreement. Mali and Brazil, for example, both had a little more than 25% agree the world is getting better. I wonder why these countries are so low and why countries like Ethiopia and Zimbabwe are much more in favor of this question. Being in the 15-24 year old generation I think me and my friends have more faith in the younger generations than my parents generation, who still have more than my grandparents generation.

But even then, only 45-60% of adults in these countries actually believe this. \n\nIndonesia is the only country where over 75% of its population of 15-24 year olds things the world is getting better. The rest of the countries' percentage of believers range from anywhere between 25%-75%. \n\n2. I wonder how human development influenced these results. Around 15-24 years of age, you slowly but surely start to lose your innocence as more terrible aspects of the world become clear. That may be why so few people in that age range actually believe that the world can experience a positive change. The older you get, however, you will witness so many changes since the years you were young, especially technological and medical advancements making life more convenient for others. \n\nThe graph also shows that this works the other way. The greater abundance of countries whose 15yr-24yr population have high faith in the future may have to do with youthful thinking and hope before it gets shattered with more experience (most likely corresponding with more years of living). \n\n3. The age range of people in my town is a bit over 40 years, and this makes me intrigued to learn more about our ways of thinking and view on if future improvements are feasible. \n\n4. \"Has Hope For Our Future Decreased?

The type of survey forces a voluntarily response, as people will only share their thoughts about whether or not they believe the world is becoming a better place, if they are up to answering the phone. So do people willing to answer the phone have a different and more collective opinion as opposed to people who aren't willing to respond? \n\nI noticed... A majority of the responses of the younger generation fall between the 25% and 75% range. Though it may indicate that people are collectively thinking the world is getting better, it also shows a range of responses. This raises questions as to what factors makes the certain countries opinion at a specific point. \n\nCommunity...

This makes me wonder if there is some inaccuracy because I don't think people can really concept how the world was when with the older generation. The world is changing so much so fast that it would be hard to determine. Of course, you know major events that happen during history during that time but, if you didn't live through that point in time you can't really know. Also, I'm wondering if the younger people are more optimistic because they have been raised with the internet which gives them more hope and belief that the world will become better. Lastly, do more younger people think the world is becoming better based the economic situation in their country. I also wonder how the graph would look different if you surveyed the 40 and older generation when they were younger and see if their answers would differ.

The world is so crazy right now, and so people would hope that everyone is at least wishing that the world is getting better with each generation.

It took me a second to recognize, but the countries on the top left side of the line (positive residual) have higher percentages of younger adults than older adults who believe that the world is getting better, while on the bottom right (negative residual) show that the older adults think that the world is getting better more than, the younger adults. It makes sense that older people wouldn't believe that the world is improving since there are more progressive young adults and conservative older adults. This leads me to wonder, how would these statistics change as time continues to progress and younger adults become older adults? Since new concepts are built each generation, it makes sense that those older than the latest generation would have a hard time understanding how the world is changing and thus not want it to change. This is important to remember to ensure that the world truly continues to get better and that all generations can be excited and confident about those changes.",

The second thing that I noticed was that the countries inside of the 40+ boundary are not in Europe or the Americas, but in Africa and Asia. Does that show that middle aged adults are more confident in their successors compared to the west? Another thing that I noticed is that the younger generations feel much better about themselves versus the older generations. The disconnect between young people and older people about the future is more alarming than anything else.\n\nThe biggest thing that I wonder is how the younger generation is so optimistic, given that many of their key development years have been distorted due to the pandemic. Adults have had the privilege to go through decades of their lives without worrying the virus, so naturally shouldn't they be more hopeful that things would go back to normal?\n\nThis affects me and my community because my life has been effected because of growing up in the pandemic. As a member of the 15-24 year old group, I can say that we've been able to find hope and happiness despite all of the negative things that have been happening in the world. I think it's important for the older generations to find some too.\n\nHeadline: \"Are teens and young adults better than their predecessors?\"",

The meaning of this plot can mean the world is becoming a better place because present young adults didn’t have to experience as much pain or suffering the 40+ years old adults did when they were younger. Another takeaway could be that older people have learned the negativity in our world through life experiences; hence, they are less optimistic. For instance, young adults could have big or unrealistic dreams and hopes for their future career, lifestyle, income, etc. But as they age, realizing the realities of how the real world works, it's easy to see why the older adults are less optimistic.

This graph would help us and geographers understand some people's views, which could lead to further research into why the younger generations have a positive prospect on their generation. It's indisputable that for even the most pessimistic country, Mali, the younger generation of the sample agrees that the world is improving. Why would the younger generations be so optimistic, why would the older generation be so pessimistic? There are many plausible reasons for this, firstly, the younger generation is born into a relatively more privileged and peaceful era, the worst a gen z could go through is the SARS or COVID-19 epidemics. I would say that most gen z's aren't hit by reality yet, the capacity for a gen z to think broad and critically is inferior to a gen x, the youth has baseless ambitions for future success, or rather, hasn't been hit by reality yet. Gen x is more pessimistic as they have most likely been hit with life and given up on some, they do not have the important resource - youth, health - that gen z has. This graph does show good news, improvement of any scale requires people with ambitions, and this graph ensures us that gen z's have the confidence of creating a better world.",

It's a country that's not very rich and its economy is based on farming, and it's not self-sufficient in food, which is why people think times are getting worse. In 2020 GDP per capita in Mali us $914. GDP growth rate is -2.5%. The country's economy is in decline.\nMoving on to Indonesia, the world's 4th most populous country on earth. Indonesia is Asian’s largest economy. Indonesia's GDP in 2019 was about $1.11 trillion. Annual inflation in 2019 was 2.72%. The economy shrank by 1.26% in January-June 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.\nI wonder why are we tacking this activity？Why only these 21 countries were surveyed and what will this graph do to the future？\nThis chart destroys my previous influence on Indonesia.

I inferred that people are likely more satisfied with the newer generations in devloping and third world countries as these types of countries grow faster compared to devloped countries because they are starting at a lower point. The faster the devlopment, the more satisfied the people are with the newer generations. \n2) I wonder what other factors about the count ries are majorly impacting the data distribution \n3) This relates to me as I am a part of the 15-24 year old range. I personally believe that the world is getting better with each generation. The data also supports my claim as most of the data point are above the solid black line. This indicates that more people in my age range agree with me than people in the 40+ age range. This data also relates to my community as a lot of people my age which I have asked also agree with me.\n4) The graph is basically comparing adults and young adult's opinions on the new generation compared to the old generations. The heading which I would create for this graph would be“What does the present think about the future?”",

This graph is showing how different ages think about the future. Their optimism about which country will develop the most. I was able to guess that US would be popular among the young people, the ages between 15-24 years old, because US is known to the younger generation as a free country, so there is not many limited things, so this is what 15-24 years old younger generations think is good, but for 40 years old, who are already are adult, they might think no limitation  on younger people is not a good think. The 40 years olds, who are adult , they are more into religious countries and I think this is because when we get old we think more about our family and most people who has religions there practice of religion is to pray good for individuals, families, states, and the nation. They also think it might also improve health, learning, economic well-being, self-control, self-esteem, and empathy.\nI wonder what in Indonesia makes the younger generations and the adults to think Indonesia might be a better country in the future. \nThis impact me a lot because I am 15-24 years old and I think my homecountry, South Korea is also one of the country that is getting better as a generation. \nI recommend 'Which country might develop the most in the future?

      "raw_comment": "I have noticed that this graph is a stacked scatter plot, which consists of participants from 7 African countries, 6 Asian countries, 4 American countries, and 4 European countries. The survey was fairly distributed (based on diversity) in these aspirations of generations bettering the world as time progresses. I have also noticed the lack of 40+ year-old participants, which I perceive as a sign that their opinion is rather less significant in this topic, because their generation has fundamentally passed. I believe that 15–24-year old’s are more reliable in this survey, because they are the current generation and could be considered as people who still have time to take new steps to better the world.  I am genuinely fascinated, and wonder how people respond to this question. What is the criteria of ‘better’? Doesn’t their environment affect the way they perceive the world? Due to this, this graph in my perspective is unreliable, these countries are in completely different circumstances (whether it’s in terms of GDP, environment, health, safety etc.). Therefore, ‘better’ is complete bias. Different standards are incompatible. Coming from myself, a citizen of the poorest country in the world, Burundi, my standards of ‘better’, definitely can’t be similar to the standards of someone from one of the richest countries in the world (USA).  One would benefit from this ‘bettering’ and another may find it as a disadvantage. \n\nMy Headline: IS THE FUTURE ‘BETTER’ FOR EVERYONE?",

Third world countries have greater optimism with the world getting better hopefully meaning that these countries are receiving more support or are developing at a faster rate. The older you get the less optimistic you get about the world which shows that experiences have a lot to say about the way that you view the earth. The more experiences you have, the more negative your thoughts are which can show that the world isn't actually getting better and you could conclude that people aged 15-24 have less leverage due to their lack of experience and existence on the face of the earth. Younger generations have not seen the world change as much as older people which means that people aged 40+ are able to make a clearer judgement when it comes to the world getting better. However, there is no single generation that conclusively thinks the world is getting better which clearly shows that personal experiences (that do not relate to the world as a whole) have a massive effect on your judgement of the question. \n\nI wonder whether we can ever say that the world is getting better. Will there ever be a time when that statement is true?\n\nGrowing up as Gen Z, I have seen the personalities of other peers and I can say that Gen Z is a forward-thinking generation that is inclusive of all people.

In developed countries of greater wealth, the divide between the youth and over 40s is more significant compared to the difference in less wealthy countries. Surprisingly, the quality of life in the countries doesn’t seem to have a clear relationship with the optimism of its people, with several countries that have a large percentage of its people in poverty or in conflict ranking higher than that of the USA, Germany, Japan and France. \n\n- **What do you wonder?**\n\nI wonder why Indonesian youth adults are so positive about the future in comparison to other countries and whether this has to do with their quality of life, culture and government system. I also wonder what causes people, in general, to become less hopeful for the future when they are older, and whether the hopes of young people are misplaced and a result of naive idealism and the belief that they have the power to change the future for the better.

The meaning of this graph encompasses a much more sinister message for younger audiences under the age of 24. As it seems with the graph, the older you get, the more you understand how ugly the world is, and therefore why they think the world is not getting better. A relevant example is as housing prices soar, median salaries stagnate, it is easy to see why the common person can be optimistic when they are young, hoping to be millionaires, but once realizing the realities of our current economy, it can be depressing. The purpose of this graph is to explain the contrasting psychology in younger and older people and how they view the world. It could be an exploration into how we change our perceptions over time.",

In addition, these interviews are not done in person or through video chats, but through telephone calls, which means that respondents don't have to take it seriously. This further takes away the credibility of the polls. While we could argue that covering 1,000 respondents from every country is still a pretty large sample size since it’s not possible to cover everybody or interview everybody in person, we should still leave our doubts on the credibility of the polls. In addition, the poll was asking respondents to address what they think regarding the entire world, but most people might only think about their own country, because that’s what matters most to them and that’s what they care about, but what they think about their own countries do not necessarily have a relationship with whether or not the world is getting better.

Adults who are aged more than 40 have had enough of these havocs, and they have been hoping that things will gradually settle down when the U.S.S.R. collapsed. However, the exact opposite has happened. The disappointment is huge, and so did the hope of having a nonviolent world drop. This should happen to be the answer to why adults aged more than 40 are generally more pessimistic about the current world than young adults aged between 15 to 24 in the poll. These young adults grew up in the best of times with pervasive high-end technologies and democracies, so they have no idea what the quadragenerians have lived through in their childhood and adolescence, which was an era dominated by political animosity between Western democracies and Eastern communist dictatorships, giving rise to a myriad of global conflicts.

Let’s take Brazil and India, who have both been involved in unpleasant domestic situations for the past decade, where Brazil has been struggling to keep the Amazon Rainforest sustainable since the wildfire disaster occurred in 2019, and India has one of the worst covid-19 pandemic situations in the world as of 2021. While both Brazil and India seem to be going through a very rough time, there’s a surprisingly huge gap between the number of Brazilians in the poll who deems that the world has gone better and the number of Indians who deems that the world has gone better. For Brazil, less than 30% of young adults and less than 25% of adults expressed optimism about the world’s status quo, compared to poll takers from India, where more than 60% of young adults and adults expressed optimism about the world’s status quo. Not only India but also countries such as the U.S., Ukraine, and Lebanon have also undergone rough times in recent years, but have more than half of its respondents expressed positive views regarding the poll question.

The countries located close to the black line like Indonesia, India, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Morocco, and Mali have relatively less difference in thoughts between generations. Overall, relatively fewer people in Brazil, and Mali are satisfied with the world, and have a hopeful view of the future, whereas people in Indonesia are more hopeful about the progress for the past few years no matter which generation they’re in. Also, the countries possessing a higher percentage of satisfaction regardless of generation are not fully developed countries. The developed countries that lead the world’s economy are mostly located in the middle part like the US, Germany, the UK.\n \nWhat I wonder: \nI wonder about the specific structure or environment of a country that impacts people to build the view of the society.

      "raw_comment": "\"The Generation of 2021 COVID TIMES!\"\n\nFirst I think that the world is not getting better with each generation I believe because all of social media is just changing who people are in good and bad ways but I personally tend to see only the bad ways. For example people who are young tend to wear clothing that shows a lot of skin thinking that they are an adult and feeling mature. From my eyes it looks like they are trying to impress others with their riches and fame. My mom told me that when you see someone dance you can tell if they are dancing cause they love to or just dancing to impress others. When they are trying to impress others it feels desperate. Another example is body image, I feel like what you see online will make you try it, which can really hurt you physically and mentally.\n\n1. What do you notice?\n- Indonesia is the highest but I really thought that the US would be.\n\n2. What do you wonder? \n- I wonder why these specific countries were chosen and how that affects people and there ego.\n\n3. How does this relate to you and your community?\n- Being apart of the 15 to 24 years old group I find this graph odd and a bit confusing but it makes me really reflect about my past and how it can help me in the future.\n\n4. What’s going on in this graph? \n- I feel like the graph is showing different opinions that people in different countries have about life and also similar opinions that people have with each other.

      "raw_comment": "\"The Opinions of Generations!\"\n\nFirst of all the most noticeable thing on the graph is that more 15-24-year-olds voted than 40+ year-olds. Another point to be made is within the 15-24-year-olds category there are many more countries and many of them are more developed compared to the countries in the 40+ year-olds category. This leaves me wondering why these countries have the response they do and why these questions were targeted specifically towards these generations. As a member of the 15-24-year-old category, I am exposed to many online sources for me to access information on the latest political and social news happening in all parts of the world. I feel as if this access to daily events gives me an advantage and a more open-minded opinion on this matter. 40+ year-olds come from a very different generation and have been raised differently and would most likely not have the knowledge or access to the internet as other generations who use it in their daily lives. Many 40+ year-olds do have the knowledge and are also exposed to the media but in a different way to how we use it. As to what is happening in the graph I believe a majority of 15-24-year-olds said that the world is getting better with each generation because we are the ones who will be living in it for a longer time and molding it into our own world. I trust the results of this graph even though I may disagree with them however, I support UNICEF so I am interested in discovering the reason behind these results.",

What impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis impacts me because I am in the 15-24 year old category in the U.S. and I think that the world will be a better place with each generation.
