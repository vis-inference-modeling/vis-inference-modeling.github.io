The players have higher rates of colored players than that of the coaches, and only baseball has less than 50% of their payers identify as colored.

What may have caused this? Does the time at which the data was recorded affect the amount of diversity?\n\nImpact: This graph has the potential to impact our community both positively and negatively.  Although it does promote racial equality in sports by encouraging the fact that people of color are able to be treated equally, it also shows that there is a lack of diversity among the coaches, which could potentially spread the message that people of color are less worthy of leading than those not of color.\n\nHeading: Are Sports Teams Really as Diverse as We Think?",

But, not many coaches are people of color, always under 50% and as low as 13% in football.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder how a white coach is going to be able to relate to the players when they encounter things like racism, especially in current times. I also wonder why there is such a disparity between representation of people of color in coaching positions and players. Is it because of racism and discrimination?\n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis gives kids watching sports on tv the idea that people of color can’t be coaches and can only be players. This also means that there are fewer role models of people of color in coaching positions for little kids who want to do that when they grow up. This causes the kids to be discouraged and even fewer coaches will be people of color.\n\nWhat’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\nAre Sports Teams Really That Diverse?",

The head coaches of color percentages for all the sports range between 13%-41%, not even reaching 50%. To add, baseball is the only sport where colored players aren’t the majority. \n\nWhat I wonder: I wonder why the colored baseball players aren’t the majority when colored players in football, basketball, and soccer are the majority. What may have caused this? could it be because of how the sport is presented to the public?\n\nImpact on me and my community: Our community is impacted both positively and negatively by this graph. It impacts us positively because the diversity among the players can encourage other sports fans to play and shows that in some sports, colored people have the opportunity to be treated equally. It also impacts us negatively because the lack of diversity among the head coaches shows us how people of color might not have the opportunity to lead and could possibly reinforce the stereotypical job types present in society.\n\nMy title:  “Colored individuals aren’t getting equal opportunities on both sides of the major sports leagues, study says.”",

Most players of the sports listed are above 50%. Excluding MLB which is 40%.\n\nWhat do you wonder? I wonder why the percentage of players of color is so high but the percentage of coaches are significantly lower. Why does this disparity occur? Another interesting occurrence is that in all sports but MLS, the percentage of colored players is twice the amount of the percentage of colored coaches. Why does MLS stick out in that respect?\n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?  This affects those of color who aspire to be coaches of these major sports leagues. A possible explanation is racial prejudice. As coaches are in a state of greater power and responsibility over a team, which represents their community. This, unfortunately, gives those of color an extremely hard journey to become a coach compared to other races.  This should not be the case and this graph clearly points this fact out. This is a probable reason for the disparity of race.\n\nWhat’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.

I wonder why is there such a noticeable difference between players of color and coaches of color?

Basketball in particular is dominated by people of color with an approximate 4:1 ratio for both genders, while baseball is almost equal but leaning towards white people with a 3:2 ratio. \nIn every poll, it is clear that the percentage of head coaches of color are significantly lower than the percentage of players of color. In National League Football, most of the players are of color (74%), whilst head coaches of color are only 13%. I wonder why is there such a noticeable difference between players of color and coaches of color? In the sports Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer, the percentage of head coaches of color are 20% lower than players of color. This is a smaller difference compared to the 60% difference in National League Football. As for Women's and Men's National Basketball Association, the percentage difference between coaches of color and players of color is around 50%. \nAlthough some differences are more noticeable than others, we can clearly see that people of color are less likely to be head coach in a major sports league. This has an impact on the community around us because it shows people of color have different opportunities to be in power than white people.\nAn interesting headline would be, \"Player of Colors vs. Head Coaches of Color in different major sports leagues\".",

The NFL has also done a pretty good job at keeping their players diverse, however not as much for their coaches. The MLS has done a pretty decent job at keeping their players diverse at 60% as well as having the highest percentage for head coaches of color at 40%. On the other hand, the MLB has less than 50% of their players of color so they haven't done as well of a job at keeping their players diverse. I wonder why the MLS has a lower percentage than the NFL, WNBA, and the NBA for their players, yet have a higher percentage for the coaches. It's odd that their players/coaches ratio of color is somewhat proportionate but then the MLS has a different ratio than the rest. This doesn't really have an impact on me unless I wanted to play professionally in the WNBA, however I'm more interested in soccer (NWSL) which is the women's version of MLS who's data isn't in this data set. On the other hand, this probably impacts the community in a way that they would be more concerned for the MLB seeing that their percentages are lower than 50%. In the graph, the data shows the diversity of players and coaches within different sports leagues. As for the title/main idea of the data, I would name it \"Modern Professional Sports Leagues Diversities\".",

The majority of percentage of head coaches of color range from 13% to 30%, very low considering how people of color are everyone who is not white. The percentage of Major League Soccer is both surprising and reasonable for me. The percentage is definitely more balance when it comes to players and head coaches.

A potential issue with this could be that coaches often maintain their jobs for a very long time when compared to the players. \nI wonder why this study excluded important sports leagues such as the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League. While the NBA has a very high percentage of diversity amongst the players in their league, it also wields a very low diversity percentage for their coaches. Then, when considering the NHL, there are only 43 professional players in the entire league that are of color. Out of upwards of 620 players, it truly shows how undiverse a sport like that is. So a sport like that would be a good equalized contradiction to the graphs being shown.\nThis has a large impact on me and my community because I come from a city with very little diversity. Growing playing sports, most of my teams have always been predominantly white and the same for our coaches. Meaning that because of the lack of diversity within our community, also reflects itself upon the sports we play.\nThe graphs in this article depict the gap between the diversity of the players of sports and the diversity of the coaches of the sports in large national sports.

I also wonder what is the current status of other predominantly white sports such as golf, or tennis.\n\nMy community is definitely affected since New Hampshire is one of the whitest states in the country.

In NBA 83 percent of their players are people of color but only 30 percent of their coaches are people of color. And the same goes for the WNBA, 83 percent of their players are people of color and only 25 percent of their coaches are people of color.\n\n2. What do you wonder?\n\nI wonder how much the percentage of people of color playing the these different sports would change in  about 5-10 years.\n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\n\nThis impacts my comunity alot because the graphs show that not alot of people of color are given the oppotunity to work in the sports field as coaches. \n\n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\n\nThis graph is showing the difference between the percentage of the colored players and the percentage of colored head coaches in the major league sports.  A catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea would be \"Is there equality in professional sports?\"",

The sport with the highest percent of colored coaches is Major League Soccer at 41%, which means that 59% of the rest of the coaches are white.\n \nI wonder if these percentages would be significantly different five or ten years ago, or in five or ten years ahead. I also wonder why the National Football League has such a high number of players of color, but the numbers for the coaches of color are so low. \n \nThis impacts my community and I for many reasons. Since Portsmouth lacks diversity, we don’t necessarily see as much racism as much as it exists around the country. As displayed in the graphs, there is clear evidence that there aren’t many professional sport coaches of color, as there are players.

However, all are rather lacking in the diversification of those in leadership positions. I also noticed that in sports like Basketball, a sport dominated by people of color, the number of head coaches of color is rather low. The percentage of head coaches of color is even beaten out by soccer, which has 23% less players of color. I wonder why sports like football and basketball, which are dominated by people of color, have so few people of color in leadership positions. I also wonder why baseball, when compared to the other sports given, has such a low number of players of color. This impacts myself and my community as I live in New Hampshire, one of the whitest states in the country. I would imagine that if you were to explore these statistics for highschool or college sports in New Hampshire that the results would be even more profound. While it is clear from the graph that people of color now have a well deserved place in the player base, it also shows that work can be done amongst coaches. Therefore, this graph provides possible insight into what these numbers could look like within New Hampshire.\n\nPossible Headline-“Leadership positions fall behind in diversity”",

      "raw_comment": "I notice the proportion of head coaches of color is significantly lower than the proportion of players of color in the specified major sports leagues. Less than 50% of every league’s coaching staff are people of color. However, more than 50% of every league’s players are people color, besides baseball. MLS has the highest percentage of coaches of color, but is not necessarily the most diverse because it has the second-lowest percentage of players of color. This led me to believe there's not a direct correlation between the diversity in players and diversity in leadership. White Americans are the racial majority of the U.S., therefore, statistically, there are fewer people of color. However, I wonder why there's such a significant disparity between the percentage of players of color and coaches of color in every major sports league? I also wonder, as more awareness is brought to movements like BLM, will leadership diversity increase in years following? I think it's especially important to bring light on these racial injustices to communities like my own. Being a state that's 94% white, the system's racial inequities don't negatively impact the majority of my community. This data validates what people of color in my community and in the entire country, deal with daily. This graph compares the percentage of players of color to head coaches of color in major U.S. sports leagues, showing the discrepancy. So, “Is the Playing Field Really Level for Those Seeking Sports Leadership?”",

      "raw_comment": "From this graph, I noticed that quite a high percentage of players across several sports are players of color, whereas not many coaches are. This may mean that talent leads to POC landing player roles, but because of systemic racism and other things in society it is harder for POC to climb up in managerial roles and earn higher wages. Also, there is quite a gap in the percentages between players of color and coaches of color. The largest gap is in the NFL with a 61% gap, and the second-largest gap is in the WNBA with a 58% gap. From this graph, I wonder how the data in this graph from the years 2019 and 2020 compares to past years. It would also be interesting to see how this data compares with sports teams across the globe. One last thing I wonder is what our society can do to break down whatever challenges or barriers are preventing more POC from becoming head coaches. I feel that this data impacts my community in the fact that it is reflective of it. Much of our society is built on systemic racism and for this reason, POC face challenges every day because of their skin color. The fact that such a glaring difference in racial distribution is apparent in big sports leagues makes me wonder how much worse it is on a smaller, more local scale. The alternate title I have created for this graph is \"Lack of Diversity in Sports: How Equal Really is the Field?\"",

This speaks volumes in that it is less so lack of opportunity but lack of ability for POC to move up in the industries that our society lives off of. The fact of the matter is that there is so much more that goes into the earnings of leadership roles, like coaching as opposed to roles such as players, that stretches beyond talent and ability and starts to fall into the unwarranted areas of politics and duplicity.  \n\nI wonder why the number of colored players almost always outnumbers the colored coaches by 3 times. I wonder why this is even an occurring issue. How could we eliminate the obstacles present in the sports industry that people of color face that enable them from achieving the same positions as caucasians?\n\nThe impact this issue has on my community is ever so present and relevant, and has been for the last 400 years. Although I live in a predominately white community, this issue is still present. If this is occurring on such page platforms such as the professional sport industry, it is indubitably present in smaller proportions.\n\nThe graph clearly displays the discrepancy between the percentage of lead coaches of color and the percentage of players who are of color in the major league sports industry.

The percent of colored players is the least out of all the leagues. I also noticed that the data for the WBNA was taken from 2019 whereas the rest of was taken in 2020. \n\nI wonder how these percentages compare to say a decade ago. Did the percent difference between coaches of color and players of color grow or shrink? I also wonder how they would compare a decade into the future. Would the numbers drastically change or stay relatively the same? I'm also curious how diversity graphs would look internationally (i.e. European and Asian sports). Is this graph indicative of how people of color are treated in professional sports? \n\nThis impacts my community because while diversity has grown very much in sports, discrimination still takes place. While I think discrimination has lessened for players, I think it still poses challenges and obstacles for staff and personnel of color.

It’s interesting that the leagues with the smallest gaps (MLB & MLS) have fewer players of color also.\n\nI wonder how these percentages compare to those from previous years. What are these initiatives referenced? Have the leagues shown progress? How are the players within these leagues affected by these gaps and are their concerns being addressed?\n\nAs a high school teacher, I think of how data like this affects my students. While those within the POC community could be encouraged by the percentage of players of color within the leagues, what difficult thoughts/questions come when they see the lack of representation in the leadership percentages. When seeing this data, would my students be motivated to dig deeper, asking themselves “Are others concerned about this?” or “What is being done about it?” My hope is that, despite their initial reaction, they would find their voice to ask the questions troubling them and their power to research and advocate further!\n\nDespite progress or initiatives that have been implemented to address the discrepancies seen above, more work needs to be done.

I wonder why the managers were shown in Major League Baseball instead of the head coaches. I have read other responses to this same question and have figured that the head coach on a Major League Baseball team is ultimately called managers.

However, the NBA has a greater percentage of colored head coaches than the WNBA by five percent. I believe the number of coaches of color and coaches who are women collaborates; the fact is that both of their numbers are extremely low compared to those of white males. The reasoning for this? I am not sure. Possibly because men who are white are more likely to get the job because of their appearance, even if the other colored coaches are a better fit for the job. My greatest assumption of why white coaches are more common in these major league sports than those of color is because these issues of racial inequality have not been addressed as profoundly as they have been this past year, especially with the Black Lives Matter Movement. Many of these coaches have been doing their jobs for what could be the last decade. I do think it would be unfair for a perfectly capable coach to be fired if he or she is white because the team thought they needed more diversity within their coaching staff. I do not think race should be involved in the decision of hiring coaches; whoever best fits deserves the position.",

Players age out of the sport, but coaches can remain in a coaching position for many years.  I wonder what the average time a coach stays with their team. This plays a big impact on our community because it shows how much our country has changed. It's weird to think that years ago people of color were separated from just using the same bathroom as white people. And now there is a big mix of different ethnicities on our national sports teams. One of the greatest baseball players, Hank Aaron, was not allowed to play with a white team until 1953. He still faced discrimination after that. This shows how much our country has grown and changed. I also wonder how hard it is to get on one of the competitive teams with your race. Many sports teams want to create diversity, so they want different races on their team. This also reminds me of colleges, many colleges look to enroll people of a different race than what the average is at that certain college.",

      "raw_comment": "As I look at this graph, I notice that in every major league sport, the percentage of players of color is higher than the percentage of head coaches of color. I can’t help but wonder if this is because of the smaller sample size of the head coaches.\n\nIn the MLB’s case, there are only 30 managers total, one for each team. Each team has, at most, a 40-player expanded roster. With 30 teams in the league, there can be a maximum of 1,200 players that play for the MLB at once. The difference between the minuscule amount of managers and the much larger number of players makes me wonder how much the sample size comes into play. If each team had a 1:1 manager/player ratio, would the percentage of head coaches of color still only be 20 percent?\n\nThe issue of the small sample size also is relevant in each one of the other sports. The NFL has the highest number of head coaches, at 32. The NFL has more than 1,500 active players every year, which gives a much higher opportunity for diversity than the mere 32 coaches. When it comes down to it, I think the reason the percentages of diversity are much lower in coaches is because of availability. The average NFL player’s career only lasts 3.3 seasons, whereas the average NFL head coach’s career is nearly a full year longer, averaging out at 4.3 seasons. To me, the long career, as well as the limited availability, are very large factors in whether or not a position is diverse or not, because the positions are not being filled as quickly.",

      "raw_comment": "What I noticed: I noticed that there is much more diversity in the player role then there is in the coaching role. Many of the sports have at least two times the percent of players of color then coaches of color, the one exception being the M.L.S. One other thing I noticed is that there are far less colored players in the M.L.B. \n\nWhat I wonder: I wonder why companies or sports corporations have not been giving out more jobs to colored people in the coaching position. With many of the players in sports now being colored I think a colored coach may end up being able to work with them better. I also wonder why there is such a lack of diversity in the M.L.B. Something just seems off when you look at all the other sports diversity compared to the M.L.B’s. \n\nImpact: This statistics show the truth about professional careers in sports being both a player and a coach.

This made us wonder why this gap in player and coaching representation exists. We also noticed that soccer and baseball have the lowest percentage of colored players. On the other side of it, Major League Soccer has the highest percentage of head coaches of color. Another thing we noticed was that all of the data is from 2020 except for one group, the Women’s National Basketball Association which is from 2019. This makes you curious as to why they would include data from a different year only for one of the groups. This also made us wonder why they would only show one women's sport out of the 5 sports showcased. Lastly, we noticed that for the MLB, managers were counted as head coaches instead of the actual coaches being counted. This made us wonder why they would have to count managers and not head coaches like they did for every other sport. From our observations and wonderings, we thought of the data’s impact on our community. For one, it makes it clear that to our community that there is a major problem with underrepresented coaches of color in professional sports. From that it makes us question what we as a community can do to lessen this issue.",

      "raw_comment": "Summary:\n \nIt is a graph showing the percentage of players and coaches with color in some sports. Based on the sports and the names of the sports associations, we can assume that these are sports associations that are based in the United States.  We’ve noticed that most of the sports have a vast majority of colored players, while most of the coaches are white. Colored athletes in basketball are well represented compared to other sports. However, coaching has a much lower percentage of minorities. We wonder why the head coaches are less likely to be people of color because for each sport the percentage of color for coaches is lower than players? We also wonder why soccer has such a high percentage of coaches of color compared to the other sports, could it be because it is more widely played in other parts of the world so there’s a wider variety of coaches? This data may impact our community because it is discouraging coaches of color to pursue a coaching position on more diverse teams. However, this could influence minorities or people of color to join sports, where everybody is included. You can become a professional player of any sport no matter your skin color. \n \nOur catchy headline for this graph is “The divide in diversity: the gap between diverse athletes and coaches”",

      "raw_comment": "Based on the data provided in the graph, we found that despite a majority of sports having large percentages of players of color, there are far less coaches of color to represent them. As an example, the National Football League consists of 74% players of color, however, has only 13% coaches of color serving in the league. We also noticed that Major League Baseball tends to have the fewest players of color in comparison to other sports featured in the graph. These findings led us to question, why do the percentages of players of color seemingly have little correlation to the amount of coaches of color? Furthermore, the information presented in the graph affects both ourselves and our community in several ways. Underrepresentation in sports can have a major effect on young people of color who hope to pursue a career in professional sports and potentially hurt their aspirations. Our group also believed it was important for players and coaches to be able to have people around them who are different and have experienced different things in order for them to grow and be able to create relationships. Our headline for this article would be : “Major league sports in relation to coaches and players of color.\"",

I also notice that the head coaches of color don't even come close to the percentage of players of color. Soccer has the highest percentage of coaches of color which makes sense since it is a more worldly sport. The more “American” sports tend to have lower diversity in coaching staff. These sports would be football and baseball. We wonder why there are less coaches of color overall compared to players of color. Is it because there are simply more players of color or is it due to discrimination amongst coaches in those specific sports/leagues. Also, what could be the criteria/standards for being a coach? Maybe there’s a specific reason why there are more players of color rather than pursuing a head coach career. This graph impacts our community by highlighting the lack of coaches and even people of color in leadership positions throughout school sports. This puts emphasis on the issue of racial inequality in the sports system.

However, it is just as important people of color have the opportunity to be coaching staff and be involved in more ways than just being players. If teams utilize people of color to play for their teams and win games, they should have just as much respect for people of color when it comes to hiring coaching staff.\n\nDiversity in major sports leagues off the field.",
