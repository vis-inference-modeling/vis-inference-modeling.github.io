Is there a cultural or logistical reason behind this high number? Additionally, are there any other variables, like team size or dietary preferences, that might explain the data variations?\n\nThis graph is relatable in terms of how nutrition and convenience foods impact performance in professional or personal settings.

Whether it’s a team preference, easier access, or just part of their team culture. It’s also interesting that eight teams, like the Buffalo Bills and San Francisco 49ers, didn’t participate.

Part of the graph alines into a clear linear relationship, however about half of all data is outliers, which suggest the absence of a reasonable connection.

Furthermore, I believe that I may have an answer to your question! If we do some math with the days of the week as well as number of days per month we can come to a solution of about 2 sandwiches per day! Thats pretty interesting just how quickly those numbers can add up!",

I immediately noticed the absurd amount of uncrustables that the Broncos eat in a week which is over double the 2nd place team. At first glance, I thought the distribution looked pretty normal and symmetrical. However, I then thought about it as a scatterplot and decided the line of best fit would probably have a slightly positive slope but an odd residual chart because of the cluster in the top left of the graph.\n\nI wonder how the Broncos could eat that many in just one week. If they include a practice squad there are 70 players meaning that on average each one eats 10 per week. There are probably some outliers on the team who are uncrustable eating demons. I also wonder what type of statistical methods they are using. Are the numbers self-reported? Do they ask every individual player on the team? Are players really being accurate or just giving estimates?\n\nThis relates to my community because alot of the people at my school are athletes and many play football so maybe they might adopt the practices of NFL players and start eating uncrustables during their games. I have never had an uncrustable so I cannot relate to the article on that level but I like food and during our tennis matches, we typically have snacks to help us recharge and stay energized throughout our matches.\n\nYou might see your favorite NFL star in the freezer aisle and here’s why",

Let's see!\n\nI notice that the graph isn't very airtight when it comes to the relationship between uncrustables and wins. From the graph it's noticeable that the relationship between the two isn't strong, rather the opposite. \n\nI wonder if the reason for the high amount consumed by Denver is due to nutritional reasons or because of a high player count. Because while they may taste good, uncrustables lack nutritional value especially for athletes. Also, I wonder why players are choosing them over orange slices. Though, it may be due to the acidity of the oranges. \n\nThis relates to my community and myself because a lot of people around me are athletes.

Denver, on the other hand, holds a massive height above sea level, an incredibly different environment from many other cities on the list.  Many sweet foods take time to prepare and serve, unlike uncrustables, which a team could grab in between practices with ease.  I also wonder if Denver gets its uncrustables directly from the source.

Seeing this graph makes me wonder if uncrustables have nutritional value to the body. Whether it is simply extra calories or something beyond that. I feel that this relates to the football community within my school because most players try to eat whatever they can whenever they can.

Since this seems like an observational study, it isn't possible to prove whether or not eating Uncrustables directly led to a higher win percentage. Uncrustables seem to be somewhat dense in calories consider it is made with peanut butter and other calorie dense foods. Also, NFL teams with more players on the field - which may be due to frequent substitutions - will therefore lead to more Uncrustables being consumed. Taking in this information, it seems as if some winning teams just so happen to eat Uncrustables due to potential factors like these.

Even though some teams are positively impacted by the amount of Uncrustables they eat per week, other teams either are not affected at all or are affected negatively. This relates to my community and I since one of the teams listed on the graph is from my state, making me question whether the areas have any relation to this specific type of snack being eaten. It makes me wonder if other areas have different types of snacks or food being largely consumed to play better. Additionally, this relates to my community and I as our school also has football teams.

For example, the Denver Broncos consume a considerably greater amount of them compared to its next in line competitor, the Seattle Seahawks. It goes from 700 to 320 quickly; that's over a 350 drop in Uncrustables. \n2. I wonder why the 2 Florida teams, Jaguars and Dolphins, have pretty close numbers, but the 2 California teams, Chargers and Rams, have a significant gap. I question if the Uncrustables are a more sought after thing in California compared to Florida. Is there greed in California over Uncrustables? \n3.

The saints had the least amount of uncrustables eaten per week with 50. There is no noticeable correlation between wins and uncrustable consumption.

Smuckers could have a brand deal with the NFL, because the football players can just eat regular peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. However, I believe that there is no brand deal, and the football players prefer Uncrustables because of they are quick and easy to eat. Unlike their PB&J sibling, Uncrustables are sealed, making their consumption clean as the peanut butter and jelly will not spill out. Additionally, Uncrustables come prepared, making them more cost-effective than PB&J sandwiches because the NFL would have to pay for the ingredients and for people to prepare those.

This makes  sense, when observing nationally ranked teams like Kansas Super that won the Super Bowl 4 times. Nevertheless, though Denver isbn doing very well this season and recently, they have won 3 super bowls all time. This begs the question, does uncrustubles have an inherent negative affect since in theory carbohydrates and a source of protein through peanut butter. This can be related to my day to day life, since Miami Dolphins is represented, being my local team. They are in the high end of the scale for uncrustables which makes sense according to the other graph; Miami is 5-7 this season, and 300 uncrustables correlates to  50-60% of wins.

This number was significantly higher than any other team in the NFl, holding a lead of 380. It also seems that there is either an extremely weak or near zero correlation between Uncrustables eaten and win percentage. \n2. It makes me wonder why NFL players consume so many Uncrustables. I think they could potentially sponsor the league based off of how high the numbers are across the board. I also wonder how many this means each person is consuming. Say there are 50 players that eat Uncrustables, that means on average they are consuming 14 a week. When NFL players seemingly could afford any food they'd like, why do they keep going back to Uncrustables?\n3. NFL players serve a highly influential role over many people. I could definitely see this influencing people in my community and others to eat more Uncrustables. \n4. The Fuel of the NFL: Uncrustable Consumption",

I first noticed this graph's sheer absurdity, but the more I analyzed it, the more sense it made. I assume they are eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, which are high in protein and good fats because of the peanut butter. I also noticed that the Denver Broncos eat the most Uncrustables by a lot, and when I researched their winning percentage this season, it was .615. The team with the least amount of Uncrustables eaten is the New Orleans Saints, with a win percentage of .385. I wonder if the weekly Uncrustables consumption can directly impact a team's skills. I also wonder what makes Uncrustables universally the best choice. Is it their small size yet high nutrition value? This relates to my community because I am a lifelong New York Giants fan, and I wonder if increasing their Uncrustable intake could help them improve their skills (because they need some improvement). I am curious because, as I previously mentioned, the Denver Broncos have a win percentage of .615, whereas the New York Giants have a percentage of .154 this season. I wonder if increasing their UPW (Uncrustables Per Week) could help them not be horrible. \n\nHeadline: Uncrustables, Half-Time Snack of Champions.",

I also noticed that most teams consume under 200 Uncrustables a week. I wonder why Uncrustables are such a common snack in the NFL and what makes them beneficial for hard-working athletes. I also wonder when exactly these started becoming common in the NFL. Was it in the last decade, or has it been a longer tradition? Finally, I'm curious when these players are eating them. Is it during a game, post-game, throughout practice, etc?

In fact, teams with win rates above 70% typically eat fewer than 200 Uncrustables per week, showing little connection between snack consumption and performance. Many lower-performing teams (with win rates under 40%) also consume fewer Uncrustables, with Denver being the main outlier. This suggests that Uncrustables may be more tied to team culture or logistics rather than directly influencing a team’s success. I wonder why these teams prefer Uncrustables, and what led to the shift from the traditional halftime snack of oranges to something like Uncrustables. I also wonder what other factors, such as practice routines or team dynamics, contribute to a team’s win percentage, aside from snacks. Given the size and physical demands of football players, I also wonder how many Uncrustables each player consumes—since they likely need more than just one or two to feel full. This relates to my community and me because in local teams and sports, everyone has a game-time snack, but that doesn’t necessarily correlate with success. For example, on my high school soccer team, we had Gatorade and chips at halftime, but we rarely won. This shows that snacks, while important, might not be the key factor in determining performance.\n\nCatchy headline: \"Uncrustables and NFL Wins: Do Snacks Really Shape Success?\"",

I notice that the Denver Broncos consume 700 per week, having consumed the most throughout the teams, while  the Saints and Bengals consume around 50 a week. I notice that when around 100 uncrustables are eaten, the win-loss rate is around the middle. I wonder why the Denver Broncos eat so many uncrustables. Do they think that it gives them more energy? Or do they just enjoy the flavor and having them as a snack? What is the reason behind the large consumption throughout the NFL?

The results seem a bit random. \n2. I wonder why a particular team could eat a lot less Uncrustables, and have a higher chance of winning rather than the team who ate a lot more.

The scatterplot shows no strong correlation between the number of Uncrustables eaten and team performance, as teams with higher win percentages (above 70%) consume varying amounts, typically below 200 weekly. Many lower-performing teams (win rates under 40%) consume fewer snacks, with notable outliers like Denver. This suggests that Uncrustable consumption is more reflective of team culture or logistics rather than performance. The data highlights diverse habits across NFL teams without a direct impact on success.\n\nWhy do the Denver Broncos consume such a disproportionately high number of Uncrustables compared to other NFL teams? Is it due to team traditions, preferences, or logistical reasons?\nIs there any underlying factor, such as team size, nutritional strategy, or regional availability, that influences the variation in Uncrustable consumption across teams?\n\nIn my community there must be a common snack ate and favorited among my high schools football team.

The second graph shows the relationship between NFL standing by teams in 2023 with the number of uncrustables the teams ate per week. I noticed in the second graph that the number of uncrustables eaten by a team does not increase their standings or help them win more. I wonder why uncrustables are so popular for these teams to eat during halftime. Does the jelly give the players energy or is it just because the snack is easy and quick to eat? I also wonder how many uncrustables each player would eat considering football players are very muscular and physically big. To even consider the snack nurturing they would probably each need to eat two or three to feel satiated. This relates to my community and me because it shows me how famous football players still eat like regular people despite them being put on a pedestal for being on a certain team or being an excellent player. It also puts into perspective how versatile the snack is, ranging from something a small child can eat to a massive football player.

Lastly, I wonder why the Denver Broncos significantly consume Uncrustables compared to any of the other teams.\n\nThis relates to me and my community because it gives insight into the potential health and performance benefits of consuming Uncrustables.

I also wonder how does the players on the Denver Broncos have enough time to eat seven hundred Uncrustables.

We can see this because most of the teams that have a 60+ win rate percentage eat 150 or less uncrustables as a team.\nDoes this have something to do with the team being lazy and not focusing enough on the sport, do these uncrustables make them play more sluggish or is. Is there one player that has a large appetite and just makes up for a large percentage of eaten uncrustables.\nThis relates to me because my family personally likes uncrustables and we keep a lot in the fridge. We probably eat like 30 a month, and to see that football teams eat that much is pretty absurd but cool at the same time.\nUncrustable does not equal untouchable.",

The graph seems relatively random, where many teams have above a 50% win-to-loss percentage in the 100 uncrustables area, there's also 3 teams in that area with a win-to-loss percentage below 40%, one of them being at 10%. The 200 uncrustable area although seems to be a low point with most teams around or under a 40% win-to-loss percentage.\n\n2. I wonder when most of the uncrustables are eaten, although the article mentions them as a halftime snack I would think most of them would be eaten during practice and not during a game. NFL players are supposed to be at the peak of human athleticism, health, and strength. How do strength coaches or staff who manage the meals and diets of the players feel about the nutrition and the amount of these being eaten by their players\n\n3. Uncrustables are a very popular snack. Seeing someone buying one from the school store is a norm at my school and they are one of the most bought snacks. They taste good but are also not a big snack that will you fill you up. I have Uncrustables at my house and my family eats them all the time.\n\n4. Uncrustables-The Sandwich of Mystery",
