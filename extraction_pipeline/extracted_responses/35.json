I'm also wondering if a whole area gets leaves and as much as it needs before the other states.   \n\nMy guess on what's happening here is the climate and elevations get higher and higher in the spring time in order to collect leaves and sunlight for its state and terrain.",

The Southern portion of the country, in particular, -- including all of Florida, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North and South Carolina repset lively and parts of Arizona and California -- boasts witnessing the first signs of Spring as early as January and February, on average. A horizontal slice running through the middle of the U.S., spanning approximately from the top of texas to middle of Nebraska vertically and from Nevada to New Jersey horizontally, is said to possess an average date of the “first leaf” appearance in March. I notice that the remaining upper one-third of the U.S. typically encounters the first signs of Spring by early April, leading into about Mid-May. One element of this graph I like, is its use of different colors to display which parts of the country begin to experience Spring when. The first question that comes to mind when analyzing this graph, is why do the Southernmost states feel the effects of Spring first, and the Northernmost parts last? What is the science behind this pattern? Also, How does the official first day of Spring, or the vernal equinox, correlate with when different states witness the “first leaf”?",
