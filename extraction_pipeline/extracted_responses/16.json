I also noticed that the tariff on the shoes is almost a third of the cost to import the shoes here. \n    I wonder why if it only costs about 26 dollars to make and ship shoes to the U.S. from China why does it cost around $145 to buy them. Because even with markups this still seems a lot more then most would expect.\n    This relates to me and my community because tariffs affect us and how we spend our money, the markup causes the shoes to cost more which will make people have to spend more money on a necessary item.",

The total import cost is $26, but the consumer price can be significantly higher, around $145, due to additional retail markup. Notably, the tariff is $6, with $2 attributed to a 10% tariff imposed by President Trump in February, while another 10% tariff from March 4 is not included in this calculation. This illustrates how tariffs contribute to the final cost of imported goods.\n    2)How do these cost components compare to sneakers manufactured in other countries—would the breakdown look different?\n    3)Since New Jersey has a strong retail presence, including malls and sneaker stores, shoppers may feel the impact of tariffs in the form of higher shoe prices.

China exports shoes to the U.S.  U.S. imports shoes.  China is our largest exporter of shoes.\n    \n    Great reasoning – “If there was a product where the price was close, but it was still foreign products people were buying, it would be a good idea to place a tariff, because that would actually make more American-made products be purchased more.”  This could happen, but the tariff might start a “tariff war,” with the exporting country putting tariffs on the U.S. goods that they import.\n    \n    You write: “Do they just want the working class to suffer?
