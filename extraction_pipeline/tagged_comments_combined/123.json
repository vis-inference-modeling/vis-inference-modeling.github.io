What is causing them to believe that ? What cause the newer generation to have views of a better future and will the older generation and new ever see eye to eye ?\n\nThis relates to me and my community because there's adults in the community that think the younger generation is disruptive, uneducated and very ignorant but lots of the newer ones think they're making a big piracy because they know to speak up , attend protests and allow fort themselves to be heard.\n\nA title for this could be \"Same Age Once ; Difference in Views\""

This is intriguing because it demonstrates how the younger generation is more optimistic about their future than previous generations. I wonder if this might be due to both groups' prejudice towards themselves. Within their age, younger individuals are more confident. On the other hand, older adults feel they are better at controlling the world. This relates to my community because we are around these regions. A title could be Optimistic generations of young adults."

The countries that the 40+ age group has the most optimism is India, Indonesia, and Nigeria. It is obvious that the younger generations have more optimism about the future of our society. \nSomething that we were wondering about is why do these young adults think the world is getting better. We wonder why countries like Brazil and Mali have little to no optimism about the future. We think it might be because they are living a poor life right now so why would they have hope for the future. We also wonder about what people are thinking when they answer this question. For example, do they think that the world will become more peaceful or will their singular life get better?\nThis topic impacts us because we are a part of the 15-24-year-old group and it is interesting to see that a lot of people our age have hope for the future. It is also fascinating to see what the 40+ group thinks of the future."

We also noticed that country’s socioeconomic condition didn’t determine its belief on if the world is getting better. There was great variation across all countries with different socioeconomic conditions. Why were these countries chosen when some of them are really small and some of them are very big? Why did they choose certain age groups from certain countries but not evaluate both age groups in the countries? The graph displays that about 65% of the US views each generation is improving. About 35% wouldn’t believe that though in the U.S.. Our societal issues drive the beliefs whether or not the generations are getting better. Additionally, the US is a first world country which can allow for a more positive outlook. Our catchy headline for this statistics set would be: World for Better or Worse?"

Additionally, there is not a strong correlation between how developed a country is and their positivity; some developed countries are quite pessimistic, and some developing countries are very optimistic. \nWe wondered why people in the 15-24 year old range were so much more optimistic than 40+ year olds on average? We also wondered what would make people in some of the developing countries so much more optimistic than the people in some of the developed countries, and if it might be because the people in developing countries were seeing positive change and an improvement in the quality of life, while the people in developing countries are not seeing as drastic and noticeable positive changes. \nWe thought that a catchy title could be “Is The World Improving? 15-24 Year Olds Think So.”"

    "original_comment": "After examining the graph, I noticed that the percentage of younger generations is higher in almost every country compared to 40+ year olds when asked if the world is getting better with each generation. This is interesting because it shows how the younger generation has more optimism for themselves compared to older generations. This could be because of a bias towards themselves for both groups. The younger people have more confidence within their own generation. Whereas the older people believe that they are better at managing the world.\n\nI wonder what specifically gave the people of Indonesia the confidence in their younger generation compared to the rest of the world. With the percentage overall being much higher compared to all other countries, I wonder if there is a specific cause to this statistic.\n\nThis relates to my community because I have noticed that much of the older generation in my community is much more hesitant towards being confident in the younger generation for the future compared to the young people themselves. Whether this be due to the hope of still being young, or another cause. It is something very prevalent in my community.\n\nThis graph shows the comparison of percentage of young adults vs 40+ year olds who believe that the world is becoming better with each generation. A catchy headline could be, Do older generations have hope in new generations?"

And it labels the countries on where the answers would put them, such as Indonesia, where is all the ways to the right and up top, it shows that the 15-24 year olds and the 40+ year olds in Indonesia both think that the world is getting better.\n2.  I wonder why some countries are really high in 15-24 year olds thinking the owls dis getting better but the 40+ year olds think the world isn’t getting better, why the drastic difference?\n3.  It’s relates to me because I am part of a generation and their is also the generation from the people below me, so we all expect them to help the world too,  and they should help make it so that people do think the world is getting better within each generation.\n4.

    "original_comment": "This graph serves to compare adolescents (15-24) and adults (40+) and their level of optimism for the future of their country. I noticed in the graph that typically the younger generations had more optimism. This is because the majority of the 15-24 year old responses in the graph were above the line that was used to show how similar the younger and older adults' answers were for each country. For example, India's point is very close to the line, which therefore shows that India's adolescents and older adults have a very similar response. Along with this information, I also noticed that the countries with the highest optimism were countries that are still developing and are continuously growing and improving. I wonder why Brazil and Mali are so low on the graph. I also wonder what determines levels of optimism. I want to know why adults are generally less optimistic. Could this be because they have more life experience and have more realistic expectations? This relates to me and my community because I am in high school and I  live in the United States. I would say that the information in the graph accurately reflects my country. A good title for this graph could be: \"Country Optimism Through the Ages\""

This could be the only explanation for why it seems there are more youth being optimistic.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to me a lot as I am part of a new and upcoming generation.

This graph depicts many more countries such as Brazil, Japan, the US and Zimbabwe showing 15-24 year olds saying the world gets better with each generation. On the opposing side, few countries such as Nigeria, India and Morocco have adults over the age of 40 agreeing the world gets better with each generation. Within theses graphs you can also see the percentage of people that are in agreement. Mali and Brazil, for example, both had a little more than 25% agree the world is getting better. I wonder why these countries are so low and why countries like Ethiopia and Zimbabwe are much more in favor of this question. Being in the 15-24 year old generation I think me and my friends have more faith in the younger generations than my parents generation, who still have more than my grandparents generation. It causes me wonder about if your lack of faith in the next generation lowers over time. \n\nCatchy Headline: \"Generational Effect\""

It is apparent that the younger generation is significantly more optimistic about the future of society. I wonder what factors influence these results. Do responsibilities or lack of certain responsibilities influence viewpoints? Maybe generational norms or clashing viewpoints of the generations could be an influence if the older group feels uncomfortable with the progression of the younger generation. I wonder if environmental issues may be a factor as well. This related to my community as I am a part of the younger generation and the U.S. A headline I would suggest would be, \"The Opposing Futures in the Eyes of Different Generations\""

    "original_comment": "1. I noticed that out of all of the countries, there were only 3 countries whose adults over 40 years old believe that the world is getting better. But even then, only 45-60% of adults in these countries actually believe this. \n\nIndonesia is the only country where over 75% of its population of 15-24 year olds things the world is getting better. The rest of the countries' percentage of believers range from anywhere between 25%-75%. \n\n2. I wonder how human development influenced these results. Around 15-24 years of age, you slowly but surely start to lose your innocence as more terrible aspects of the world become clear. That may be why so few people in that age range actually believe that the world can experience a positive change. The older you get, however, you will witness so many changes since the years you were young, especially technological and medical advancements making life more convenient for others. \n\nThe graph also shows that this works the other way. The greater abundance of countries whose 15yr-24yr population have high faith in the future may have to do with youthful thinking and hope before it gets shattered with more experience (most likely corresponding with more years of living). \n\n3. The age range of people in my town is a bit over 40 years, and this makes me intrigued to learn more about our ways of thinking and view on if future improvements are feasible. \n\n4. \"Has Hope For Our Future Decreased? Here's 40 Countries' Input for Why and Why Not\""

There is a large difference of what the younger age groups say compared to the older as they both have had different life experiences.  Personally, if you were to ask me my thoughts about the world today compared to someone in an age group a lot older than me the answer would be a lot different. This relates to me and my community because I am within the 15-24 year old age group or the younger generation so I get to see the lives of teenagers change and see how and why they think the world is getting better as the generations continue. A catchy headline is \" what is in store for the future\""

    "original_comment": "I noticed that the younger age groups are typically the more optimistic ones when it comes to their views on how the state of the world is heading. This is particularly present in developed countries like the U.S and Japan. Indonesia, however, seems to be optimistic across all age groups, well ahead of the rest of the countries in the graph. \n\nI wonder what leads to the optimistic outlook when it comes to Indonesia. Why exactly do all age groups think the world is getting better with each generation? I also wonder why most people 40+ don't think this way. Is it some sort of bias because THEY aren't the new generation and people 15-24 are biased BECAUSE they are the new generation?\n\nThis relates to me and my community because as someone who is apart of this 'new generation', this is about my future and the state of the world as I grow up and live my life as an adult. World issues and mechanics like the economy, healthcare, and politics are going to be strongly influenced by this 'new generation' as I grow up.\n\nA catchy headline would be \"New Generations Breed New Hope\"\n\nOne clarification I got from the reveal is that optimism in new generations is based on how people think childhood is changing and how newer generation grew up."

So do people willing to answer the phone have a different and more collective opinion as opposed to people who aren't willing to respond? \n\nI noticed... A majority of the responses of the younger generation fall between the 25% and 75% range. Though it may indicate that people are collectively thinking the world is getting better, it also shows a range of responses. This raises questions as to what factors makes the certain countries opinion at a specific point. \n\nCommunity...

Based on the graph -24 year old's are more optimistic then 40 and older's. This makes me wonder if there is some inaccuracy because I don't think people can really concept how the world was when with the older generation. The world is changing so much so fast that it would be hard to determine. Of course, you know major events that happen during history during that time but, if you didn't live through that point in time you can't really know. Also, I'm wondering if the younger people are more optimistic because they have been raised with the internet which gives them more hope and belief that the world will become better. Lastly, do more younger people think the world is becoming better based the economic situation in their country. I also wonder how the graph would look different if you surveyed the 40 and older generation when they were younger and see if their answers would differ. A catchy catch phrase: Countries Optimistic Generation"

This could lead to how the younger generation is more optimistic and believe a lot around generations being changed, compared to the 40+ year old are more stuck in the past rather than living in the future. \nThis makes me wonder if the world itself it more revolved around change or the past revolutions. How that connects to the 15-24 year old groups are more populated in rich areas. Also why is there a gap in between 25-39 years of age are they special? \n The top 50% of both sides is the representation of how the world is viewed by betterment and generations coming. \nOverall, this graph is saying that how different age groups are being viewed and how that can change the world view of different countries and vs the 40+ year old is more established. \nPossible Headline: how different age groups are changing our world ?"

It is apparent from the graph that the group of 15-24-year-olds are much more optimistic and hopeful for the future of the world. Additionally, the wealth of each country that is optimistic is equally spread out among countries that are optimistic for the future. I wonder why the difference in optimism for the future is so distinct between the different age groups. This graph relates to me and my community because today, you often hear that we (my generation) need to start making changes, specifically regarding the environment, to have any hope for our future. A title for this graph could be: The Youth is Hopeful for the Future of the World"

People that are 40+ are more likely to have experienced hardships and trauma in their lives, which can make them less optimistic because they see the dark side of the society. Younger generations are more likely to have more hopes and dreams with the development of the society and with their careers. We can see that many countries in Africa show that they both the older and the younger generation are very optimistic. The graph is aimed towards both teens and older generations so they can think about why the graph produces such results. This graph shows a comparison of views, explicitly between different generations and different countries. The scatter plot can compare relationships between the variables, in this case the older and newer generation and the countries. We can use this graph to see the line that has been created to divide the overall optimism of the generations. We can also reflect on the factors that is behind the data."

    "original_comment": "What I find both interesting and predictable is that in most countries, there are more 15-24-year-olds than 40+-year-olds who think that the world is getting better with each generation. It took me a second to recognize, but the countries on the top left side of the line (positive residual) have higher percentages of younger adults than older adults who believe that the world is getting better, while on the bottom right (negative residual) show that the older adults think that the world is getting better more than, the younger adults. It makes sense that older people wouldn't believe that the world is improving since there are more progressive young adults and conservative older adults. This leads me to wonder, how would these statistics change as time continues to progress and younger adults become older adults? Since new concepts are built each generation, it makes sense that those older than the latest generation would have a hard time understanding how the world is changing and thus not want it to change. This is important to remember to ensure that the world truly continues to get better and that all generations can be excited and confident about those changes."

    "original_comment": "The most evident feature of this graph is that the amount of people aged 15-24 believe that the world gets better with each generation is very large, compared to the other portion of the graph, describing 40+ year olds. The second thing that I noticed was that the countries inside of the 40+ boundary are not in Europe or the Americas, but in Africa and Asia. Does that show that middle aged adults are more confident in their successors compared to the west? Another thing that I noticed is that the younger generations feel much better about themselves versus the older generations. The disconnect between young people and older people about the future is more alarming than anything else.\n\nThe biggest thing that I wonder is how the younger generation is so optimistic, given that many of their key development years have been distorted due to the pandemic. Adults have had the privilege to go through decades of their lives without worrying the virus, so naturally shouldn't they be more hopeful that things would go back to normal?\n\nThis affects me and my community because my life has been effected because of growing up in the pandemic. As a member of the 15-24 year old group, I can say that we've been able to find hope and happiness despite all of the negative things that have been happening in the world. I think it's important for the older generations to find some too.\n\nHeadline: \"Are teens and young adults better than their predecessors?\""

    "original_comment": "This scatter plot, representing the data between two discrete variables with moderate positive correlation, shows how young adults (ages 15-24 years old) are more optimistic than 40+ years old adults. The audience can be psychologists, therapists, counselors, or anyone concerned about mental health, directing them towards pessimistic adults and offering help. The meaning of this plot can mean the world is becoming a better place because present young adults didn’t have to experience as much pain or suffering the 40+ years old adults did when they were younger. Another takeaway could be that older people have learned the negativity in our world through life experiences; hence, they are less optimistic. For instance, young adults could have big or unrealistic dreams and hopes for their future career, lifestyle, income, etc. But as they age, realizing the realities of how the real world works, it's easy to see why the older adults are less optimistic. The purpose of this plot is to compare and contrast how two different groups of people view our world, providing data for anyone interested."

    "original_comment": "I noticed a generational divide between youths and adults. When asked if the world is getting better with each generation, youth ages 15-24 seemed more optimistic than the 40+ especially within ‘first world' countries such as the US, UK, Japan and Germany. Only 3 of 20 countries have older generations who believe the world is improving which leads me to wonder if countries not mentioned believe it’s not improving at all. I wonder if people between ages 15-24 will have a different mindset as time goes on since the world keeps changing and what factors contribute to the populace’s perception on whether the world is becoming a better place. This relates to me and my community since I’m part of the youth and am surrounded by my age group at school but also have older cultured parents and family so I can see the different mindsets first hand between the youth and the older generation. I have noticed that older generations seem to make generalizations about the younger generations and that there is a common agreement among each side with many people between ages 15-24 finding themselves in line with each other about feeling the world being a better place as we progressively move forward with each generation.

This graph would help us and geographers understand some people's views, which could lead to further research into why the younger generations have a positive prospect on their generation. It's indisputable that for even the most pessimistic country, Mali, the younger generation of the sample agrees that the world is improving. Why would the younger generations be so optimistic, why would the older generation be so pessimistic? There are many plausible reasons for this, firstly, the younger generation is born into a relatively more privileged and peaceful era, the worst a gen z could go through is the SARS or COVID-19 epidemics. I would say that most gen z's aren't hit by reality yet, the capacity for a gen z to think broad and critically is inferior to a gen x, the youth has baseless ambitions for future success, or rather, hasn't been hit by reality yet. Gen x is more pessimistic as they have most likely been hit with life and given up on some, they do not have the important resource - youth, health - that gen z has. This graph does show good news, improvement of any scale requires people with ambitions, and this graph ensures us that gen z's have the confidence of creating a better world."

The data is from a survey in 2021 that included 21 countries. Indonesia has the highest score on this graph, and Mali has the lowest. In the US a larger percentage of people age 15-24 think the world is getting better than people age 40+.\n\n2. I wonder why people age 25-39 were not included on the graph. I wonder why this graph chose to show the difference in opinion between different age groups instead of showing the overall percent by country.\n\n3. This relates to me and my community because the US was included in this survey. I am not surprised that a larger percent of young people have a more positive outlook than people age 40 or older.\n\n4. “Are young people more optimistic about the world?”"

Indonesia is at the top so More than 75% of adults are positive about changing times. \n\nAs you can see in Wikipedia that Mail is not a rich country. It's a country that's not very rich and its economy is based on farming, and it's not self-sufficient in food, which is why people think times are getting worse. In 2020 GDP per capita in Mali us $914. GDP growth rate is -2.5%. The country's economy is in decline.\nMoving on to Indonesia, the world's 4th most populous country on earth. Indonesia is Asian’s largest economy. Indonesia's GDP in 2019 was about $1.11 trillion. Annual inflation in 2019 was 2.72%. The economy shrank by 1.26% in January-June 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.\nI wonder why are we tacking this activity？Why only these 21 countries were surveyed and what will this graph do to the future？\nThis chart destroys my previous influence on Indonesia. I usually thought that high happiness would be in developed countries like China and the United States.\nHead line：Does having money really make people feel happier"

One thing that I notice is that countries near to the top right corner of the graph (where both more adults and young adults agree that the world is getting better with each generation) are mostly third world and developing countries. I inferred that people are likely more satisfied with the newer generations in devloping and third world countries as these types of countries grow faster compared to devloped countries because they are starting at a lower point. The faster the devlopment, the more satisfied the people are with the newer generations. \n2) I wonder what other factors about the count ries are majorly impacting the data distribution \n3) This relates to me as I am a part of the 15-24 year old range. I personally believe that the world is getting better with each generation. The data also supports my claim as most of the data point are above the solid black line. This indicates that more people in my age range agree with me than people in the 40+ age range. This data also relates to my community as a lot of people my age which I have asked also agree with me.\n4) The graph is basically comparing adults and young adult's opinions on the new generation compared to the old generations. The heading which I would create for this graph would be“What does the present think about the future?”"

This graph is showing how different ages think about the future. Their optimism about which country will develop the most. I was able to guess that US would be popular among the young people, the ages between 15-24 years old, because US is known to the younger generation as a free country, so there is not many limited things, so this is what 15-24 years old younger generations think is good, but for 40 years old, who are already are adult, they might think no limitation  on younger people is not a good think. The 40 years olds, who are adult , they are more into religious countries and I think this is because when we get old we think more about our family and most people who has religions there practice of religion is to pray good for individuals, families, states, and the nation. They also think it might also improve health, learning, economic well-being, self-control, self-esteem, and empathy.\nI wonder what in Indonesia makes the younger generations and the adults to think Indonesia might be a better country in the future. \nThis impact me a lot because I am 15-24 years old and I think my homecountry, South Korea is also one of the country that is getting better as a generation. \nI recommend 'Which country might develop the most in the future? ' as the catchy headline for this graph."

    "original_comment": "I have noticed that this graph is a stacked scatter plot, which consists of participants from 7 African countries, 6 Asian countries, 4 American countries, and 4 European countries. The survey was fairly distributed (based on diversity) in these aspirations of generations bettering the world as time progresses. I have also noticed the lack of 40+ year-old participants, which I perceive as a sign that their opinion is rather less significant in this topic, because their generation has fundamentally passed. I believe that 15–24-year old’s are more reliable in this survey, because they are the current generation and could be considered as people who still have time to take new steps to better the world.  I am genuinely fascinated, and wonder how people respond to this question. What is the criteria of ‘better’? Doesn’t their environment affect the way they perceive the world? Due to this, this graph in my perspective is unreliable, these countries are in completely different circumstances (whether it’s in terms of GDP, environment, health, safety etc.). Therefore, ‘better’ is complete bias. Different standards are incompatible. Coming from myself, a citizen of the poorest country in the world, Burundi, my standards of ‘better’, definitely can’t be similar to the standards of someone from one of the richest countries in the world (USA).  One would benefit from this ‘bettering’ and another may find it as a disadvantage. \n\nMy Headline: IS THE FUTURE ‘BETTER’ FOR EVERYONE?"

The results highlight that the younger generations are much more optimistic about themselves and their future world, whilst the older generation believes that there is little hope for the future. This is concerning as it is worrying that the adults are so negative about our future, possibly meaning that they see a future that younger generations cannot see.

    "original_comment": "The graph clearly shows a larger percentage of people aged 15-24 think the world is getting better. Third world countries have greater optimism with the world getting better hopefully meaning that these countries are receiving more support or are developing at a faster rate. The older you get the less optimistic you get about the world which shows that experiences have a lot to say about the way that you view the earth. The more experiences you have, the more negative your thoughts are which can show that the world isn't actually getting better and you could conclude that people aged 15-24 have less leverage due to their lack of experience and existence on the face of the earth. Younger generations have not seen the world change as much as older people which means that people aged 40+ are able to make a clearer judgement when it comes to the world getting better. However, there is no single generation that conclusively thinks the world is getting better which clearly shows that personal experiences (that do not relate to the world as a whole) have a massive effect on your judgement of the question. \n\nI wonder whether we can ever say that the world is getting better. Will there ever be a time when that statement is true?\n\nGrowing up as Gen Z, I have seen the personalities of other peers and I can say that Gen Z is a forward-thinking generation that is inclusive of all people. This can help the world be better to a certain extent."

In my experience this means being surrounded with statements about the world dying due to climate change or a political debate or the earth splitting into millions of pieces. However I have never felt threatened by this so I wonder why young adults are not loosing hope about our future.

I wonder if their location impacted their results. I also wonder if these results will change in the future or how these results would have compared to the past. \n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis impacts me because I am in the 15-24 year old category and I think that the world is getting better with each generation. Also, I think that my community is very optimistic so they will do everything in  their power to make changes so the world can be a better place. \n4. What's going on in this graph?

In developed countries of greater wealth, the divide between the youth and over 40s is more significant compared to the difference in less wealthy countries. Surprisingly, the quality of life in the countries doesn’t seem to have a clear relationship with the optimism of its people, with several countries that have a large percentage of its people in poverty or in conflict ranking higher than that of the USA, Germany, Japan and France. \n\n- **What do you wonder?**\n\nI wonder why Indonesian youth adults are so positive about the future in comparison to other countries and whether this has to do with their quality of life, culture and government system. I also wonder what causes people, in general, to become less hopeful for the future when they are older, and whether the hopes of young people are misplaced and a result of naive idealism and the belief that they have the power to change the future for the better. Is it because older people have less faith in the younger generations that they believe that things will get worse?"

    "original_comment": "This scatter plot with a minimal pearsons correlation between the two variables (15-to-24-year-olds and adults) was made to show the contrasting attitudes whereby younger people are more optimistic than adults. Its audience could cover a wide variety of people. Because the causation for such a phenomenon could be analyzed through multiple lenses or theories. The meaning of this graph encompasses a much more sinister message for younger audiences under the age of 24. As it seems with the graph, the older you get, the more you understand how ugly the world is, and therefore why they think the world is not getting better. A relevant example is as housing prices soar, median salaries stagnate, it is easy to see why the common person can be optimistic when they are young, hoping to be millionaires, but once realizing the realities of our current economy, it can be depressing. The purpose of this graph is to explain the contrasting psychology in younger and older people and how they view the world. It could be an exploration into how we change our perceptions over time."

For the age between 15 to 24 years old, they were both born in the year around 2000 and experience an extreme pace of development. Could you imagine that 15 years ago most of us are using little smarts and only have the function of communication and now we are using the latest version of the iPhone, Huawei, Samsung with a lot of different functions?  I don't need to explain the convenience that smartphones bring to people's lives, do I? Everyone can see it. With the ability to connect all over the world and share their lives, play games, watch videos......at any time and anywhere, which young people can imagine what life was like before the popularity of the Internet and smartphones decades ago?\nThis may be a big reason for this phenomenon.\n2. What do you wonder?\n\nA 21,000-people survey is relatively small. People aged 25-40 who are neglected should also have the right to express their thoughts. \n\n3. How does this relate to you and your community? \nObviously, people in our country did not participate in this survey. Under the great convenience brought to me by the intelligent society, I don't want to give up this change or imagine how inconvenient life seemed 20 or 30 years ago.\n\n4. Make a headline\n Optimistic About the Future?"

For the age between 15 to 24 years old, they were both born in the year around 2000 and experience an extreme pace of development.

Countries like Indonesia, India, and Nigeria which are not as developed as the US, Japan, or Germany have an equal and high on percentage mix of each generation believing that the world is becoming a better place. \n\nI wonder why Indonesia is such an optimistic country with the population saying the world is getting better with each generation. I also wonder why the older generations of first world countries don’t believe that the world is becoming a better place than the adults in less developed countries. \n\nThis relates to me because I’m a part of the 15-24 year old generation. I believe that the world is getting better with each generation as many people are learning new ideas and are being exposed to more concepts throughout the world through social media and etc.\n\nHeadline: Am I The Reason For The World’s Progress?"

I wonder why the European states are below the u.s within their answers depicting on the same reasonings. I would’ve expected the u.s to be lower, no offense.

This relates to my community because there are a lot of controversial topics and people can't agree on things. This creates hate within the country. Since older people have lived longer they must think that they had it better before.\n4. \"Countries with higher poverty rates believe that the world is getting better\""

My parents didn't have phones, TVs, or video games. If they grew up like this they would know the truth.

    "original_comment": "[4/5] I wonder if the poll is deemed adequately convincing since the 1,000 respondents on average from each country represent only a tiny portion of the countries’ total population. One thousand people out of the U.K.’s 67 million people is a mere 0.0015%, which cannot precisely tell what the people of the U.K. generally think about this question. In addition, these interviews are not done in person or through video chats, but through telephone calls, which means that respondents don't have to take it seriously. This further takes away the credibility of the polls. While we could argue that covering 1,000 respondents from every country is still a pretty large sample size since it’s not possible to cover everybody or interview everybody in person, we should still leave our doubts on the credibility of the polls. In addition, the poll was asking respondents to address what they think regarding the entire world, but most people might only think about their own country, because that’s what matters most to them and that’s what they care about, but what they think about their own countries do not necessarily have a relationship with whether or not the world is getting better. This potential loophole could also adulterate the authenticity and relevance of the survey results regarding the question. But despite all these accounts, this was still an interesting survey that is worthy of noting and further researching."

Adults who are aged more than 40 have had enough of these havocs, and they have been hoping that things will gradually settle down when the U.S.S.R. collapsed. However, the exact opposite has happened. The disappointment is huge, and so did the hope of having a nonviolent world drop. This should happen to be the answer to why adults aged more than 40 are generally more pessimistic about the current world than young adults aged between 15 to 24 in the poll. These young adults grew up in the best of times with pervasive high-end technologies and democracies, so they have no idea what the quadragenerians have lived through in their childhood and adolescence, which was an era dominated by political animosity between Western democracies and Eastern communist dictatorships, giving rise to a myriad of global conflicts. That explains why younger adults have generally more positive thoughts on the world’s status quo."

    "original_comment": "[3/5] The second thing I noticed is that there isn’t a clear cause-and-effect relationship between a country’s status quo and the percentage of people in that country who think the world is getting better. Let’s take Brazil and India, who have both been involved in unpleasant domestic situations for the past decade, where Brazil has been struggling to keep the Amazon Rainforest sustainable since the wildfire disaster occurred in 2019, and India has one of the worst covid-19 pandemic situations in the world as of 2021. While both Brazil and India seem to be going through a very rough time, there’s a surprisingly huge gap between the number of Brazilians in the poll who deems that the world has gone better and the number of Indians who deems that the world has gone better. For Brazil, less than 30% of young adults and less than 25% of adults expressed optimism about the world’s status quo, compared to poll takers from India, where more than 60% of young adults and adults expressed optimism about the world’s status quo. Not only India but also countries such as the U.S., Ukraine, and Lebanon have also undergone rough times in recent years, but have more than half of its respondents expressed positive views regarding the poll question. This is an interesting phenomenon that is worthy of further investigation."

    "original_comment": "[1/5] The first thing I noticed is the sharp variance between the percentage of adults and young adults who think the world is becoming better where the former age group has a more negative view regarding the issue than the latter age group for 18 of the 21 countries selected for the poll. In my opinion, this discrepancy happens because adults who are older than 40-year-old have more knowledge and experience about how the world has changed over the past half-century, as to young adults who have only witnessed the change over the past one or two decades, so older adults usually possess more visual and tangible opinions to whether or not the world is getting better with each generation. In the contemporary world, we are facing many crises ranging from the most urgent public health concerns such as the Ebola Outbreak, the exacerbating HIV/AIDS epidemics, and the worldwide covid-19 pandemic, to wars and unrests such as fighting and skirmishes in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Ukraine, political mayhems embroiling over Myanmar, Egypt, Hong Kong, Algeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, the United States, the United Kingdom, as well as the surging cases of terrorist attacks and hate crimes all over the world both in developing countries and developed countries, and finally to an increased number of natural disasters caused by global warming and the cumulative over-exploitation of the environment, such as forest fires in the Amazon rainforest, Australian desert, and Taiwan."

The countries located close to the black line like Indonesia, India, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Morocco, and Mali have relatively less difference in thoughts between generations. Overall, relatively fewer people in Brazil, and Mali are satisfied with the world, and have a hopeful view of the future, whereas people in Indonesia are more hopeful about the progress for the past few years no matter which generation they’re in. Also, the countries possessing a higher percentage of satisfaction regardless of generation are not fully developed countries. The developed countries that lead the world’s economy are mostly located in the middle part like the US, Germany, the UK.\n\nWhat I wonder: \nI wonder about the specific structure or environment of a country that impacts people to build the view of the society. For example, I wonder how the society in the United States influences the younger generation to get a positive view of the world, whereas the older generation tends to view the future negatively though they’re living at the same time.\n\nRelation to my community:\nAs the graph shows, the society that I spent most of my lives in had a more positive view of the world among the younger generation, rather than 40+.\n\nA catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea:\nIs the world indeed getting better?"

    "original_comment": "\"The Generation of 2021 COVID TIMES!\"\n\nFirst I think that the world is not getting better with each generation I believe because all of social media is just changing who people are in good and bad ways but I personally tend to see only the bad ways. For example people who are young tend to wear clothing that shows a lot of skin thinking that they are an adult and feeling mature. From my eyes it looks like they are trying to impress others with their riches and fame. My mom told me that when you see someone dance you can tell if they are dancing cause they love to or just dancing to impress others. When they are trying to impress others it feels desperate. Another example is body image, I feel like what you see online will make you try it, which can really hurt you physically and mentally.\n\n1. What do you notice?\n- Indonesia is the highest but I really thought that the US would be.\n\n2. What do you wonder? \n- I wonder why these specific countries were chosen and how that affects people and there ego.\n\n3. How does this relate to you and your community?\n- Being apart of the 15 to 24 years old group I find this graph odd and a bit confusing but it makes me really reflect about my past and how it can help me in the future.\n\n4. What’s going on in this graph? \n- I feel like the graph is showing different opinions that people in different countries have about life and also similar opinions that people have with each other. I feel like that this can really affect people and their life."

    "original_comment": "\"The Opinions of Generations!\"\n\nFirst of all the most noticeable thing on the graph is that more 15-24-year-olds voted than 40+ year-olds. Another point to be made is within the 15-24-year-olds category there are many more countries and many of them are more developed compared to the countries in the 40+ year-olds category. This leaves me wondering why these countries have the response they do and why these questions were targeted specifically towards these generations. As a member of the 15-24-year-old category, I am exposed to many online sources for me to access information on the latest political and social news happening in all parts of the world. I feel as if this access to daily events gives me an advantage and a more open-minded opinion on this matter. 40+ year-olds come from a very different generation and have been raised differently and would most likely not have the knowledge or access to the internet as other generations who use it in their daily lives. Many 40+ year-olds do have the knowledge and are also exposed to the media but in a different way to how we use it. As to what is happening in the graph I believe a majority of 15-24-year-olds said that the world is getting better with each generation because we are the ones who will be living in it for a longer time and molding it into our own world. I trust the results of this graph even though I may disagree with them however, I support UNICEF so I am interested in discovering the reason behind these results."

The countries located close to the black line like Indonesia, India, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Morocco, and Mali have relatively less difference in thoughts between generations. Overall, relatively fewer people in Brazil, and Mali are satisfied with the world, and have a hopeful view of the future, whereas people in Indonesia are more hopeful about the progress for the past few years no matter which generation they’re in. Also, the countries possessing a higher percentage of satisfaction regardless of generation are not fully developed countries. The developed countries that lead the world’s economy are mostly located in the middle part like the US, Germany, the UK.\n\n2. I wonder about the specific structure or environment of a country that impacts people to build the view of the society. For example, I wonder how the society in the United States influences the younger generation to get a positive view of the world, whereas the older generation tends to view the future negatively though they’re living at the same time.\n\n3. As the graph shows, the society that I spent most of my lives in had a more positive view of the world among the younger generation, rather than 40+.\n\n4. Is the world indeed getting better?"

This graph relates to me because I fall into the younger age group and I do believe that new generations do better the world especially when you think about how much people fought for their rights. Young people's optimism!"

There are a few places where - by a narrow margin - older people are more positive, but it is more common for young people to be substantially more optimistic.  Japan and the US stand out as having round about a 40% gap between proportions of young and old saying the world is getting better.  This is an interesting counterpoint to many discourses around generational attitudes: especially the notion that GenZ is somehow more 'cynical', and also the evidence that the younger generation has a much worse time than the baby boomers when it comes to job security and home ownership prospects."

These dots are indicative of the younger generation, 15-24 year old, who are in agreement, while there is scarce support for 40+ year old. I wonder why the younger generation believes this. I think they do because this world today is typically more accepting than it was then. They might also be living an easier and better life than their parents and they are challenging authorities more etc and fighting change. I think older people might think the world is becoming worse because they don't like how the younger generation is handling the world today and they might be more traditional, or it just could be that's how they generally feel. It is understandable to say the world is getting worse because today we have more opportunities to make a difference. Back then things were cruel and there were harder situations to avoid. However, times have changed now and a lot of things that are happening don't have to, people are just choosing to and the world will never change for that reason."

In the graph it seems that mostly the younger generations believe that the world is getting better but the older generations don’t really think the same. In the graph we can see the percentages in each country separated by ages 15-24 and 40+. There are only 3 countries that the older generations believe the world is improving which leads me to believe that in the countries not mentioned they believe it is not improving at all. Due to percentages being counted it's clear that there is not even a low percentage of older people that have faith in where this world is going."

In twelve of the twenty one surveyed countries, over 50% of youths (ages 15-24) demonstrated optimistic views. Adults, on the other hand, reported positive attitudes towards the future in only six countries. 2) The glaring question is why do older generations have a generally more negative mindset, while younger generations envision brighter futures? I wonder what factors contribute to the populace’s perception on wether the world is becoming a better place? Bie B. Sea from Taihu lake cited significant economic growth in Indonesia to account for its overall positivity. Nicky from Wuxi, China conjectured that societal pressures (for example the stresses of the education system) lead to negative outlooks. 3) I believe this information is very relevant to my community. In my speculation, growth mindsets are fundamental to progress. Positivity is an essential part of any healthy society, helping to motivate, inspire, and encourage its populace. I hope that my community and country will work towards improving the world for future generations, irrespective of their view of the future. 4) I would title this graph, “Age and Attitude: How Different Generations Perceive the Future”"

I wonder the factors that affected these countries’ views. How are the two age group so coordinated when it comes to their views on this topic? Also, I wonder how the younger generations (younger than 15) would respond to this study.\n3. This reminds me of a lesson we had in Psychology, about the happiest countries in the world (I’m pretty sure Denmark came in first).

I find this really interesting because often people think of younger generations as being especially pessimistic and negative, whereas this graph says otherwise.  The US is one of the farthest points away from the line, with a positive residual, meaning that more young people think the world is getting better, and less older people do. I wonder if what the world was like as the older people were growing up shaped how they feel about future generations - they might be negative because newer ideas and concepts that they are not used to are surfacing, and many people do not like change.\nI wonder what other countries' data looks like - is there a specific reason that they chose to only survey/include these countries? If they included other countries, this graph might look completely different. I also wonder about the ages in between - how do 25-39 year olds feel about the world?\nThis relates to me and my community because I am in the younger generation, and I'm surprised at how positive so many young people are, because it often feels like the opposite.\n\nTitle: The World - Half Full or Half Empty?"

    "original_comment": "In this graph, I see that significantly more amount of young people, 15-24-year-olds, believe the world is getting better with each generation.  Two countries that I immediately notice have large differences between the opinions of the younger and older groups surveyed are the United States and Japan. For the United States, almost 65% of the younger generation believes the world is getting better with each generation while about 35% of the 40+ group believes this. For Japan, about 60% of the 15-24-year-old group believes the world is getting better with each generation while about 25% of the older group believes the prompt. Both countries have such vast changes with the younger groups' beliefs compared to the older. I wonder why these specific two countries have the largest differences. I also wonder why Indonesia's percentages are so high up for both groups, having over 75% for both. This relates to me and my community because my country, the U.S is part of this poll taken and my age is also considered in the graph, so it's interesting to see how my own generations view our progress of bettering the world. A title appropriate for this graph would be \"Each Generations' Thoughts on the Bettering of the World.\""

    "original_comment": "In nearly all of the countries surveyed, more young people (aged 15-24) believed the world was getting better than middle aged to older people (ages 40 ). There were no significant outliers that had the opposite relationship. I also noticed that the differential between the two was greatest in countries that had relatively low population growth rates, like the United States and Japan. I learned in my human geography class that relationships like that can end out exacerbating issues for the older dependent population. I wonder if potentially that is one of the reasons why older people tend to have a more pessimistic viewpoint on where society is headed. I also wonder why some countries, like Indonesia, were so overwhelmingly positive in their views across the board, but some countries were overall very negative. I think it likely is influenced by the situation of internal affairs within that country. I’m not familiar with the political systems of each country here, but I think it’s also plausible for that to have a significant impact on people’s world views. This graph could be titled “Is the world improving with the new generation? They think so.”"

    "original_comment": "ies and upon more than 21000 people, I can see how the reliability of the data is furthermore positively enhanced. After stating the first impressions of the data collected in the graph my primary observation is that the overall mean percentage of the 15- to 24-year-olds who say that the world is getting better with each generation is higher than 50% whereas the mean percentage of the 40+ year-olds who say that the world is getting better is lower than 50%. The analysis of this data can bring to the spotlight the fact that older generations may have already felt that their contribution towards a more developed and \"brighter\" future wasn't enough or that more recent generations would not be able to receive better life conditions when comparing themselves with the newer generations. This type of feeling could increase depression rates and a more rather negative outlook towards humanities's future. On the other hand, the data expresses and illustrates how the younger generations are more optimistic about the world's situation heading to future generations as well. Younger perspectives when discussing the future can surely extract more hope and greater future aspirations to bring to the world in order to expand aspect in which the human race can improve upon. Indonesia is a clear example of this, as it is the most optimistic country with both age ranges assuming that the world is getting better with each generation. However, it is also important to mention that Mali is the most"

    "original_comment": "I’ve noticed on this graph that generally more people aged 15-24 believe the world is becoming better with each generation compared to people 40  years old believing the world is becoming better with new generations. This graph confuses me because it doesn’t really send a message or show a general trend for different country types, the only thing I really noticed was that there were more African and Asian countries that both had higher group percentages compared to European and South American countries. I’m curious as to why the author of this graph has chosen to only choose 21 countries and didn’t include a lot of age groups- because 15 year olds and 24 year olds are very very different people. It’s a very small data set too, with only 21,000 people taken in all of the countries. This graph relates to my community because there’s a stigma in my community and my country that more recent generations are “more lazy” than older generations, which might be the cause of the very low percentage of 40  year olds thinking the generations have been getting better. \n\nDoes geography change the different generation’s views on each other?"

Have they not seen as much as older generations? \n\nThis relates especially to my school community. We are all within this range of ages so maybe we feel the same way.\n\nThis graph is showing the different between adults and teenagers/young adults and how they think differently about the world. Younger teens are say thing more often then adults that the world is getting better with each generation.\n\nA catchy headline could be: Is the world really getting better? Or, how do humans really feel about our world?"

When one as an individual is conscious about the significance of the world's past, present and future situation and the possible outcomes of the passing of time onto one's life, sufficient and concise data is one of the most precise ways of determining if one's opinion can be supported or reevaluated. From my personal interpretation, the graph's aim is to establish a clear comparison between two significantly different but undoubtedly related age ranges opinions regarding an important and especially relevant topic nowadays in order to make further discussions about the data. The topic being discussed is no other than the effectiveness of a perceived completion and overall accomplishment thought of the world's situation getting better with each generation. Data is presented in a scatter plot format with a progression line and pattern enhancing a positive correlation; however, from the data dispersion I am able to identify that the correlation is not strong and that it is more likely for the data to have a higher standard deviation perhaps effecting a prompt but erroneous conclusion of the determination of unreliable data.

Mainly there are nations where both groups are more positive about the future, neither groups are more positive about the future, or more young people are positive about the future than older people. \n\nI wonder if in general, older people are less optimistic, or if there exists a correlation between a nation’s relative wealth and how positive it is about the future. \n\nThis is relevant to me because I enjoy thinking about complex questions like these, and EVERYONE thinks about stuff like this once in a while. It is very important to our society to consider questions like these. \n\n“How Positive Are We About the World’s Future?”"

    "original_comment": "The graph showing plots of multiple countries and their older and younger population answering one question is the world getter better with each generation. I immediately noticed that the younger generations are a lot more optimistic than the older generation. The US for example has more than 50 percent of their 15-24 year olds believing that the world is getting better with each generation while less than 50 percent of the 40  year old believe the same thing. I am wondering based on this data could the political swing of one generation also be affecting their ideas about the future. In addition, could there be a discrepancy in what the older versus what younger populations believe is better for the world. This data is important and affects both my community and I due to the fact that the optimism in a community is really important when trying to advocate for anything. The large gap presented in the graph indicates that there are major differences between what the older and younger generations believe is better for the world. That is going to cause some tensions in a community such as mine if the discussion of differences is not addressed properly. A name I would give to this graph would be: Are the Kids Ruining Everything?"

Countries like the United States and Japan have a large amount of disagreement across these generations. The location of each country does not seem to matter too much to the overall data, but there do seem to be clusters of European countries (Argentina, Spain, France, U.K.)  and African countries (Zimbabwe, Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria).\n\nI wonder if the data would be different if the \"older\" generation (40+) was split into two or three sections.  What about people younger than 15 and people from 25 to 39 years old? Are we missing important information? I wonder how this data would contrast with a graph of how each country is doing economically. I wonder how it would contrast with a graph of which countries have different politics and ways of controlling society. How would it be different compared to news coverage and access to resources? This data is probably heavily influenced by the bias of each generation for themselves. I wonder if this data will increase or decrease in the future or if biases are the only factor.\n\nThis relates to me because I am in the younger generation and I hope that the world is getting better.\n\nAn article title could be: A Generational Divide: Are we really getting better?"

I notice that there doesn't seem to be too much correlation between which countries are more positive or negative towards the future. It seems there are some countries from around the world, but this graph does not include many others like China or Korea, or Norway just to name a few.\n\nI wonder if the older generation is generally less positive towards the future because they have lived longer and seen what the past was like and the present and future as less good. For example, a 50-year-old who has probably lived their childhood and adolescence without phones and computers and the internet might be more opposed to it than a 15-year-old who has probably lived most of their life with phones and the internet. I also wonder if older generations are generally more pessimistic or if they are just pessimistic towards the future of the world. In addition, I wonder what would this graph look like if it were taken 20 years ago, or 50, or 100? \n\nThis relates to me and my community because I have noticed that my friends who fall in the 15- to 24-year-olds category do seem to be more open to change and more readily positive towards the future. However, adults around me are more neutral or slightly negative towards what the future holds. \n\n\"The World is Getting Better, But for Who?\""

Especially in countries like the US, there is a huge difference, with about 70% of young people believing the world is getting better and only about 30% of the elderly believe it’s getting better. However there are some countries like Indonesia, India, and Nigeria who have relatively even numbers of people, young and old, who think that the world is getting better. I wonder why higher percentages of people in less developed countries say the world is getting better. Does it have anything to do with the fact that they see their own lack of development and then they see how the world around them has many improvements, and perceive improvements from around the world as much greater things than people from more developed countries might perceive them? This graph poses many questions about perspective, especially with the topic of improvement being very perspective based. This relates to my community because I am part of the younger generation, so it is very uplifting to see that large amounts of young people have very positive outlooks on the world. I would title this graph “Optimism: the new divide between generations”."

The variables are the responses of the younger people and the responses of the older people. It shows a moderate correlation between young people and more positive responses towards the world's growing conditions. \nI feel that the audience intended for this graph are sociocultural and brain development professionals. From a psychological standpoint, this audience may be able to use this information to see the differences that different cultures' cognitive processes, regarding optimism, differ with age.\nI think the purpose is to show the difference in cognition between different societies and ages. As younger people seem to have a more positive mindset, there may be a developmental stage during 15-24 years old that could impact your mindset. In addition, differences in culture can play a role in the differences in mental development."

    "original_comment": "The first thing I noticed is how 'Young' people tend to lean towards the idea of \"the world is getting better with each generation\"  more than 'older' people. As in the graph, you can see that most of the 15 - 24-year-olds in the provided countries fall between the 50-75% range, with none under 25%. However, when looking at the Y-axis for people over the age of 40, most countries fall below 50%, and have a significant amount under 25%. \n\nThere is not exactly a noticeable trend among the data, however you do notice that most of the '1st world' countries have a much higher 'optimistic' younger population than an older one. As you can see in the graph, the US, UK, Japan and Germany are all within the 50-75% range on the X-axis (younger people believing the world is getting better), meanwhile on the Y-axis (Older people believing that the world is getting better) all the previously mentioned countries fall below the 50% mark. \n\nThere is an anomaly within this result, which would be Indonesia, as both the younger and older generations agree that the world is getting better as time goes on. This is likely due to the fact that Indonesia's economy has increased by over 600% since the year 2000, this would obviously see a great increase in the quality of life and general welfare of the populace. Under such conditions, it is quite understandable why Indonesia's population generally have such 'high hopes' for the future."

    "original_comment": "In this graph I notice that there is a common theme in which most countries seem to have a higher percentage of 15-24 year olds that believe that the generations get better as they go on where as with the 40 and above age group, they don’t believe that generations get better as they go on. This makes me wonder if the younger age group believes this because they are closer in age to the younger newer generations and grew up in a similar fashion. Rather the older groups have the opposite opinion of the younger generations not being better because they grew up much differently then the older generation. Meaning, they might have different morals or beliefs than the other generation therefore making it difficult for them to understand how the younger generation is being raised. This relates to my community because we are currently living in a generation that is much different than my grandparents generation. A new headline for this graph could be “ New vs. Old”"

This relates to my community in that I am a high schooler that is consistently surrounded by people in the age range that is sampled in the graph. My generation will be responsible for changing the world for the better, so this directly relates to my life. Most often, I hear that people have a hopeful and optimistic outlook of what will become of the world when my generation goes into the work force and becomes active citizens.\n\n4. The graph displays the percentage of 15-24 year olds in different parts of the world that believe that each generation will positively impact the globe. First world counties tend to have higher percentages while second and third world countries usually have a lower percentage of people with this opinion.

And I also noticed that Indonesia is a pretty big outlier, standing out from the rest by a decent amount. I wonder if that the reason many wealthier countries elder generation don't think that the world is becoming better with every generation is because of the wealth of that country or perhaps it is much deeper than that and is maybe due to how the older generation was raised and that they may fear change or think of change as a negative thing. In my community most teens including me think that yes the world is becoming a better place with every generation, but i couldn't really speak for the older generation."

Indonesia has high percentages on both sides, while countries like Brazil and mail have low percentages.\n\nWhat do you wonder\n\n    I wonder what causes the younger generation to think more optimistically about the future. Why is Indonesia so high in both metrics but Brazil so low? Are countries that are currently in rapid development (like India) more likely to be higher on the scale?\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community \n\n    This relates to the United States because this chart shows younger people  are much more optimistic than older people. I’m not sure where this may come from, but it shows a generational divide about what “getting better” means to someone. \n\n What’s going on in this graph?

    "original_comment": "I can see from this chart that young people in most countries believe that the world is on a good path. But except for three countries, young people in other countries will be more optimistic about the development of the world than the elderly. But according to a psychological survey by UC Davis, 51 is the peak of optimism, but it doesn't seem to show this in this chart. This raises my question: is this data reliable enough? What is the specific age of the person who answered this question? But when we assume that the data of this questionnaire is reliable, a very interesting question arises. Can an optimistic attitude towards the development of the world really show that this person is an optimistic person? Because in my opinion, this is a very objective problem. I am in China because the epidemic protection is very strict. In China, entering shopping malls or some public areas requires a QR code to prove that they are healthy, but many middle-aged and elderly people are rejected because they don't have mobile phones or can't use them. This will make them feel abandoned, abandoned by the world. This is just a small example, but when we re-examine this chart, I believe everyone will have the answer."

Scientists who wish to analyze optimism in young people and anyone else who may be interested in this topic. Using this data we can conclude optimism can vary based on different events that an individual has experienced in their lifetime, specifically if living standards have increased significantly. This data was collected to analyze how individuals from different backgrounds are coping with the Covid-19 pandemic and identify potential causes for individuals feeling concerned for the future. This data is presented as a two-variable scatter chart with many different data points from a diverse selection of locations and economic backgrounds."

A generational change in world view? Is it politically, economically, or culturally based? The US and Ukraine have similar outlooks; however, they are very different counties. What might be common between these two countries that causes similar percentages?\n\nThis relates to my community and I through the idea that we are a data point on this graph. This graph can help us understand not only where we as a generation stand in terms out the future outlook, but where we as a country stand in respect to other countries. This may be able to shorten a generational gap, allowing us to put ourselves in our elders shoes and better understand their point of view.\n\nThis graph compares each countries percentage of 15-24 year olds who have an optimistic outlook on the future of our world, and the percentage of 40+ year olds who don't. A catchy title for this graph might be \"The Generational Divide\""

There is stark contrast between the generations portraying the difference in their optimism or hope. I also notice that they surveyed about 1,000 people from each of the countries listed.\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder how accurate this graph truly is. Considering that they are using 1,000 people to represent countries filled with millions upon millions of people, the margin of error has to be pretty large. I also wonder how much the generational effect holds true. This graph would go to prove how people that have seen more have less optimism, but I wonder why there are so many 15-24 year olds that are hopeless for the future generations. \nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to me and my community for I fit into the 15-24 year old category and am a member of Gen Z. If I were asked the same question, I would likely say that the world is not getting better with each generation because of certain things I have learned over the years. With that being said, I also do not think it has gotten worse. Almost the same, per say. \nWhat's going on in this graph?\n\"Gen Z: The Hopeful or Hopeless?\""

On the contrary, more developed nations such as France and Spain have far higher levels of pessimism, especially amongst the older generations. group.  \n\nI wonder why countries such as Japan have such high levels of pessimism amongst their older generations as opposed to their younger foes. I’m also very curious about why Indonesia is such an outlier in the graph. The country is not fully developed compared to its American and European counterparts.  Also, why does the graph omit 25 to 39-year-olds?\n\nThis graph relates to me and my community because we, Americans, are listed on the graph as the US. I’m part of the younger generation meaning that statistically, we are more optimistic than other first-world countries such as Germany, Japan, and Spain.\n\nThis graph is showing the levels of optimism amongst both younger and older generations. A younger audience is denoted by someone who is from 15 to 24 years old while the older audience is denoted by someone who is older than 40 years of age. The positive line of 1 shows equal thinking of both age groups. As a country gets further and further from the line, there is a larger disparity between the thinking of younger generations vs older ones. A catchy title would be “The surprising reality of optimism around the world.”"

    "original_comment": "1. I noticed a lot of things in this graph. Particularly how the younger generation is much more optimistic about the world than the older generation. Which is shown in the graph because only 6 countries are above 50% in the older generation and 12 countries are above 50% in the younger generation.\n2. I wonder why Indonesia has such a high percentage of people in both the younger generation and older generation that say the world is getting better with each generation.\n3. This relates to me and my community because the majority of people from 15 to 24 in the world think that the world is getting better with each generation and those are the people who are choosing jobs and starting to impact the world. I think it affects my community and I because those people have a positive mindset and think that they’re generation can improve the world. That affects me because I’m part of that generation that is trying to help the world.\n4. The graph is a scatter plot with a line of best fit that shows how the age of people and what country they live in affects their views on if the world is getting better with each generation. A catchy headline is “Is the younger generation too optimistic or is older generation just realistic?”"

I do notice however that primarily Indonesia has high percentages for both categories. I wonder why people specifically in Indonesia are very optimistic about the future. This relates to me because it shows what percentage of people don’t support my generation and what percentage does. When there are big percentage differences that can cause conflict in my life with others who share different views. A catchy headline could be “Older Generations Have Little Faith for the New Generation”."

I also noticed that Indonesia overall has a much higher rating of people saying the world gets better with every generation and this was across the board for ages surveyed. I also observed that the closer each country's dot was to the black line, the more the two age groups agreed with the other. For example, Morocco, Nigeria, and India all show that these two groups have the relative same consensus. I saw that about 21,000 and up people have been interviewed in each country by phone. I wonder if certain areas of these countries have different overall opinions and if they contrast from those in different areas.

    "original_comment": "1.\tI notice that, the younger generation in this data, aged 15-24, is more optimistic about the future because they believe that life is improving with each generation. To analyze this graph, the X-axis is represented for more than 40 years old, and the Y-axis is represented for the age of 15 to 24. This graph is including 21 different countries. According to the data, Indonesia has the highest score, and Mali has the lowest score. Indonesia is the only country in which more than 75% aged 15 to 24, population believes the world is improving.The countries which optimistic in both age groups are usually LICs such as Nigeria and Ethiopia. The countries with higher HDI have a higher percentage of younger generations which the world is getting better than more than 40+ generations. Besides, people aged 25 to 39 were not involved in this survey.\n\n2.\tI wonder why they excluded the age group of 25-39 in this survey and why did Mali get the lowest point? Why older people are less optimistic than younger people? \n\n3.\tI believe this graph is relevant because since my nation is not included in this survey and I haven’t thought about whether the world is becoming a better or worse place compared with generation. However, in my opinion among each generation, we could make a better future. This graph pleases my interest in learning more about our thought processes and determining whether further developments are achievable.\n\n4. \"Is our future getting better or worse?\""

    "original_comment": "The graph compares the younger vs older generations faith in future generations to better the world.  I notice the younger group of people have a more positive outlook on the future of the world and the impact new generations have than the older generations. Infact, with the exception of India, Nigeria, and Moroco every group of younger people have more faith than their older counterparts. I wonder if this disparity in faith is simply old people being pessimistic, or if it is a result of an overconfident younger generation that lack the wisdom to realistically look into the future. This doesn’t really relate to my community, regardless of our faith in future generations both current generations young and old will strive to better the world, thus this comparison is no more than an insightful insight into our faith in the future."
