    "original_comment": "I noticed a few trends in the graph. It seems that the smallest percentage of people visit their parents in person (15-25%), while the largest percentage of young individuals (50-75%) reach out to their parents either daily or a few times a week. Additionally, the gender difference in communication habits, with women being 20% more likely to use text or video-chat compared to men.\nI wonder if the prevalence of text and video-chat communication among young people is due to its convenience compared to writing long texts. Furthermore, I'm curious if there's a difference in communication between the young adults who were surveyed who are closer to 18 and those closer to 34. This could potentially bring to light whether certain life stages influence the amount of communication people have with parents. This is relevant to me and my community as I am going for college next year where my main form of communication with my parents will be texting and video-chatting to stay in touch  since I won't be seeing them daily.\n\nTitle:“Buzz buzz”"

I'm curious why this happens and if it has anything to do with societal gender norms revolving around masculinity. \n3.It relates to me and my community, due to the fact that, it shows that young people are taking less time and effort to contact their parents.

Actually there is a higher percentage of young women who Call or video chat their parents often than the percentage of men who just text their parents often. I wonder what gender has to do with the percentages of young adults talking to their parents. Why are males less often talk to their parents than females. Is this because males tend to have less of a relationship with parents than women, or is this hormonal? This relates to my community because I am currently attending high school, and around this time many teens are turning into young adults. This causes children to grow away from there parents which makes this graph almost directly representative of me and my peers.\nAre You Contacting Your Parents Enough?"

The results portrayed in the graph relate to many of my family, friends, and I who are either close to or currently entering college and adulthood which likely involves moving away from our parents and childhood homes. When we reach this stage in our lives, this graph can help predict how often we will connect with our parents through texting, calling, or visiting in person because the samples of people used in the graph are not too distant from our ages, and the experiment is recent."

    "original_comment": "I notice a clear difference in how frequently young adults reach out to their parents based on gender. On average, young women maintain more consistent communication with their parents compared to young men, with a significant gap observed in electronic forms of communication such as texts or calls. The discrepancy remains even when considering in-person visits, albeit to a lesser extent. This disparity could be particularly noteworthy during the college years, a period which is known for creating a newfound independence for many. This makes me wonder how different these statistics would be different if the age range was narrower. It seems fair that young adults, especially those in college, would reach out less to their parents as they feel  more independent, but is this trend truly as evident past college years? This analysis is significant for me and my community as it highlights the importance of regular communication with parents, especially by a young male adult within this age range. It makes me want to reach even more as a college student myself and truly keep my parents involved with my life away from \"home\".\n\nHeadline: \"Is Parental Communication a Common Priority?\""

I notice that more young women(75%) than young men(50%) say that they reach out over text at least once a day or a few times a week. Overall in this graph across the three different categories, young women reach out to their parents more than young men.  I also noticed that the mode of communication least frequently used across the graph is in-person visits. This makes sense as respondents are between 18 and 34 and most likely do not live in close proximity to their parents and may hold very demanding jobs or may be involved in rigorous higher education programs. Online communication has also become more convenient and prominent in the 21st century. I wonder why young women reach out to their parents across all of the categories. I wonder if they have closer relationships with their parents than the young men or if they simply just feel the need to maintain more frequent communication. This relates to myself and my community as I will soon be going to college and turning 18 and I wonder where I would fall on this graph. I know I will maintain contact with my parents and I assume it will fall into a more digital category especially when I am away in college.\n\nWhy parents want daughters: they keep in touch!"

    "original_comment": "I notice that on average young women reach out to their parents more than young men in each surveyed form of communication. This gap is much larger when it comes to electronic communication, either through texts or calls, as women do so at about 20 percentage points higher than men. Young women still visit their parents in person more on average than young men, but the difference is only a few percentage points in this category. \n\nI wonder how these differences look when the groups of interest are broken down beyond gender and the 18 to 34 age range. First,  I would be interested in seeing just college age (around 18-24) because this is their first experience living away from home, while a 34 year old has been away from their parents for possibly 16 years. Also, college students technically still live at home and are usually dependent on their parents in some way, as opposed to 34 year olds who likely live on their own and are fully independent from their parents. \n\nThis relates to me and my community because I am currently  a male in this age range (and will be for many more years), so the disparity is concerning. It makes me more conscious of how often I am communicating with my parents and something I should consider more in the future. \n\nHeadline: \"How Often Do You Check on Your Parents?\""

Additionally, texting appears to be the preferred mode of communication over more personal methods like calling or meeting in person.\n2. Will they start reaching out or communicating with each other more intimately like visiting in person or calling? \n3. This is relevant to both me and my community because as we all mature, we each have some form of parental guidance, and as we develop into our unique individuals, our interactions with each other and our parents can evolve accordingly. I personally make sure to make it a habit to stay in consistent communication with my family, especially my parents. \n4.\"Connecting Generations: Navigating Communication with Parents\""

However, I've noticed that, while young women utilize text messaging and telephone at a larger rate than young men, in-person check-ins are equally popular among young men and women, with around 20-25% of them adopting this method of communication.\nThis trend makes me question why young guys reach out at a significantly lower rate than young women. I also wonder, is texting the most frequent because society has been accustomed to it? \nIt is significant to my community because texting is extensively utilized and an essential component of our everyday life. The graph is equally important for individuals my age, as it depicts a communication pattern. The graph emphasizes texting as the primary mode of communication in today's world, which has become an essential part of our daily lives.\nYoung women take the lead in reaching out to parents in every aspect compared to young men."

    "original_comment": "I notice that overall, young women tend to reach out to their parents more often than young men do. The difference between men and women visiting their parents in person is fairly similar, with women only visiting their parents in person about 5% more than men. The difference between men and women reaching out to parents via text, phone, or video chat is much more significant. It seems to be about a 40% difference, with women having the higher percentage. I wonder why exactly it is so common for women to reach out to their parents more often than men. There seems to be some sort of association between gender and parent relationship fostering, but the graph makes me wonder what exactly is causing this significant difference. I also wonder why there is such a drastic difference in face-to-face visits versus texts or calls. For a relationship as important as one with a parent, I would normally assume that people would place more emphasis on in person visits, but this graph is causing me to think otherwise. This graph relates to me and my community because I identify as part of the group of young women who does not live with my parents. As a result, I have to make an effort to foster the relationship I have with my parents, updating my life through calling and texting. In person visits are less frequent simply because of physical distance between our homes. A catchy headline would be \"Young Adults are Children Too- Reach Out to Your Parents!\"."

The gap between the number of young women and men questioned and the methods by which participants reach out are also displayed in the graph. I've seen that women communicate with their parents more than men do in every communication category. I also see that texting is more frequently used when it comes to reaching out to parents, while visiting in person is the least common. \n2. I wonder why women contact their parents more than men? I also wonder why people visit in person less? \n3. This is relevant to me and the community because, as I'm sure many others will agree, having personal communication with one's parents is important. Since many people my age, like myself, are already planning on going to college texting and calling parents will be the most convenient ways to stay in touch especially for those who are going out f state. \n4.

    "original_comment": "What I notice in this graph is that there are differences in the percentage of whether young people reach out to their parents at least once a day or a few times a week. We observe that there are preferred methods from which both men and women use to reach out. Then there is also variation across gender shown in the graphs. We can see that young women are more likely than young men as a whole to reach out to their parents even across all three methods. However, the strength of this increase is very similar for sending texts and phone or video-chat but not as much as for visiting in person. I wonder why it is that men are less likely to reach out to their parents since it's observed for all three methods.  About 2 in 4 young men who took this online survey who are aged 18 to 34 reach out to their parents at least once a day or a few times a week while about 3 in 4 women do this. Further indicating that the parents of women tend to be more involved in their lives as a result of women reaching out more. This relates to men and my community since I fall into this demographic of young men who don't reach out to my parents very often. This relates to the male community as a whole since it could correlate with the silent epidemic surrounding men as they are more afraid to reach out. Preferring to keep to themselves. A catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea is \"Gender Differences in Parental Communication: Involvement in Their Children's Young Adult Lives.\""

I wonder why women are more likely to reach out to their parents. A statistic that stands out, and relates to my community, is that less than a quarter of young men and women actually visit or reach out to their parents in person each week. I understand this statistic as it probably gets harder to find the time to visit your parents in person when you may live farther away or have a job. So sending a text to your parent every week is a simple and easy way to stay in contact."

It says that they either text, call, or actually talk to their parent in person. The graph shows that they are most likely to send a text to their parents with it being roughly 50% males will text their parents while 75% females will text their parents. The least likely to be done is actually visiting the parent in person with only 26% females and roughly 18%. There is definitely a difference here with males always being in the lower margin and females being in the larger margin. This most likely has to do with the gender differences between males and females."

While only less than or about 25% of men and young women visit their parents in person at least once a day or a few times a week, more accesible ways of connection like Texts and calls show an even greater divide between the interaction of young men and women with their parents. \n\nI wonder if tradititional gender stereotypes affects how often a young person will reach out to their parents. Young men are typicall societally encouraged to be more independent and not ask for help as often, while women are expected to lead more domestic, family-centric lives. Does this phenomena have even deeper roots, such as biological instincts unique to each gender?\n\nI have a very close relationship to my parents as I am the only child and only daughter. A lot of my family friends are adults who only have boys, and I am their “honorary daughter”. It’s frequently mentioned how much more I reach out to them, and that “parenting a girl is very different.”  \nBY: AYESHA FROM FOSSIL HILL"

Or is it because the 18-34 age group lives away from home, in-person visits are unattainable.\n\n3- This relates to my community because I fit the demographics of this study and also feel represented in the data.

However there are also stereotypes of the female figure being responsible for taking care of the parents. Personally though, I'm going to be the young man who contacts and sees their parents all the time."

Honestly its expected i can't say i notice too much that blows my mind. my mother is wanting badly to move to florida and im not able to partly for past memories but also i need to stay with my grandparents and when they're gone im going to florida so i can be with my father figure and being 3000 miles away give or take makes it definitely expected that i wont be able to call or visit her 24/7 or even anywhere near that \nHow does this relate to you and your community? it shows that this might be part of the reason people either say they are or are diagnosed with depression because their parents are a huge part of life and you honestly should call them everyday and at least say you love them, life is fast don't let it catch up to you\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\nThe Parental extinction is among us its starting with cutting communication."

The graph also shows the means by which participants reach out and the disparity between young women and young men surveyed. I notice that in every category of communication, women reach out to their parent(s) more than men. I wonder why this is. Is it just a matter of inherent psychological differences between men and women?  Additionally, I noticed that visiting a parent in person is the least popular method of reaching out to a parent and texting is the most popular method. I speculate that this is because of convenience. Texting is so easy and can be done in a matter of seconds while driving all the way to visit your parents could take hours depending on how far they live. I am surprised texting and calling are not more popular because they are so accessible and easy to use. I wonder how this demographic would change if they surveyed people older than 34. This relates to me because I am going to college next year and will be forced to reach out to my parents because I will no longer be living with them. I will try to contact them at least a few times per week most frequently using text and calls rather than visits. \n\"Message Mothers More!\""

Also, out of the forms of communication, most young people contact their parents through sending text messages at 50% for young men and 75% for young women. This is interesting because text messages could be considered a faster form of communication than phone/video-chat and visits in person. I wonder if more young people prefer sending text messages to their parents because it is fast and convenient. Why do the amount of young people that contact their parents often vary between men and women? I wonder if young adults closer to the age of 18 that were surveyed reached out to their parents more or less than young adults closer to the age of 34. How many young adults stated that they do not contact their parents and were screened out of the survey? This graph relates to me because I am 18 years old and when I move to college this year, I wonder what form of communication I will rely on the most to contact my parents. How will my age impact how frequently and what source I contact my parents? This also relates to my community as it can demonstrate the closeness of parent–child relationships and young adult’s dependence on their parents in adulthood. \n\n“The Importance of Text Messages–In Young Adults’ Contact With Their Parents”"

    "original_comment": "This graph depicts the difference between young men and women and how likely they are to communicate with their parents daily. Womenare more likely than men to reach out to their parents at least once a day. However, it is mainly digital with just under 75% responding that they text and over 50% saying that they call their parents. Only about 25% of young women responded that they visit their parents on a daily or weekly basis. On the other hand, young men are far less likely to have active communication with their parents. About 50% text, between 25%-50% call, and less than 25% see their parents frequently. I wonder why the percentage of seeing parents regularly is so low. I understand that this poll was asked by 18-34-year-olds who live with either one or no parents, but I feel like this statistic is so low. I wonder how these statistics have changed over time. With the new age of social media and technology, has there been a significant increase in young people who can communicate with their parents daily? This relates to my community because as a teenager, communication is key with my parents and most of my friend's parents. If we do not answer them right away or frequently check in, parents nowadays are prone or getting anxious and hysterical. I wonder in the upcoming generation if these numbers will spike because of the constant communication needed between child and parent. \n\n“Call Your Mom!

Overall, women are more likely to contact their parents than men. \n\nI wonder how this may affect the future generations when reaching out to parents. If communications between children and their parents become less likely, is it more likely for crimes to increase? Most children depend on their parents for decision making, to educate them and lead them on the right path but if communications decrease significantly most children can begin to depend on themselves.\n\n Most children depend on their parents for decision making, to educate them and lead them on the right path but if communications decrease significantly most children can begin to depend on themselves and that can lead to complete chaos.\n\nYoung People Reaching Out: A Viewpoint on Generational Shifts in Parental Relationships"

    "original_comment": "What I notice is how the percentage of young people who reach out to their parents at least once a day or few days a week is particularly dominated by women. Whether its sending texts, phone or video-chat, or a visit in person, women always tend to do so more then men and some by a large margin. What I wonder is if the percentages have increased or decreased over time by both men and women of how often they reach out to their parents.  Also if visiting in person decreased when more kids started getting phones. What's going on in this graph is it is trying to show the different ways young people will reach out to their parents, characterizing it by gender, and showing the percentage difference between men and women and how men truly do not seem to reach out as much as women. This relates to my community because I have siblings and I think my sister, who is out of the house, and I reach out more then my brother does. We also would tend to see them in person more rather then call or text. \nCatchy headline: \"Incoming call, it's your parents! Accept or Decline?\""

While only less than or about 25% of men and young women visit their parents in person at least once a day or a few times a week, more accesible ways of connection like Texts and calls show an even greater divide between the interaction of young men and women with their parents. \n\nI wonder if tradititional gender stereotypes affects how often a young person will reach out to their parents. Young men are typicall societally encouraged to be more independent and not ask for help as often, while women are expected to lead more domestic, family-centric lives. Does this phenomena have even deeper roots, such as biological instincts unique to each gender?\n\nI have a very close relationship to my parents as I am the only child and only daughter. A lot of my family friends are adults who only have boys, and I am their “honorary daughter”. It’s frequently mentioned how much more I reach out to them, and that “parenting a girl is very different.” \n\nDaughter’s are the favorites for a reason!"

Many college students, which forms a big part of my friends and also where I aim to be next year to live apart from their parents, so texting and calling are our primary means of communication.

With such a large disparity between the men and the women, I wonder how representative these results are for young men and women. Since the data was gathered via online survey over a relatively short time frame, I think the results might not be able to be generalized to young men and women in general. Whether or not the results are generalizable, knowing these statistics about the strength of relationships between parent and child is useful knowledge to have. There is a large amount of information regarding mental health issues in young adults, and cross referencing with data like this has the possibility to give insights to other broader issues. A title for this could be \"Screen Age: How Electronics have Impacted Parental Communication\""

I notice how young women send texts, phone or video-chat, and visit their parents in person at a higher rate than young men do. Why is this the case? Could it be because women are more family-oriented? Visiting in person is rated the lowest way to communicate or reach out to parents. Have social media and technology ruined genuine face-to-face conversations? I wonder if it's because the 18-34 age group lives away from home, in-person visits are unattainable.

I additionally noticed that the majority of young adults contact their parents virtually, either through texting or calling, with a minority of young adults visiting in person, likely due to long distances between them and their parents. I find it interesting that while women and men are almost just as likely to visit in person, there is a much larger gap between women who virtually keep in touch with their parents and men that do. I wonder what factors contribute to this large difference. I am curious to know what this graph would look like if they provided different, more specific age groups within the young adult category. Given that the survey includes young adults from ages 18-34, I wonder how many college students reach out their parents vs older young adults in their thirties. This graph affects me and my community, as in the next couple of years I will be in college, and I am aware of the importance of keeping in touch with my parents, even if I end up at a school that is not close to home. \"Keeping Connected\""

The graph tells viewers in what way and what percentage of people reach out to their parents at least once a day. Interestingly, this graph shows that young women are more likely to reach out to their parents overall. I wonder if this is because women are more family-oriented or thoughtful. I think it is interesting that the least popular mode of contact between parents and their children is in-person visits. I wonder if this is because a lot of these children live far from their families, maybe in college, or maybe they have just moved away. I also wonder what the specific age group that participated in this survey is, and if there was a major difference in responses between the ages (ex. an 18-year-old vs a 24-year-old). I would title this graph \"Parents and Children: How Connected Are They Really?\""

    "original_comment": "In this graph, it is measuring the percentage of people ages 18-34 that don’t live with a parent who say they reach out to a parent at least once a day or a few times a week and is comparing the percentages of young men versus young women and the methods in which they communicate with their parents. I noticed that, in general, young women had a higher percentage of reaching out to parents than young men did. I also noticed that, for both women and men, the most popular means of communication was by sending texts and the least popular means of communication was visiting in person. I wonder if this is because sending texts requires much less time and effort compared to visiting in person so it is easier for young adults to quickly send a text amidst their busy daily schedules. I also noticed that there was the lowest difference in percentage between men and women for visiting in person and wonder why this is the case compared to the disparity between genders being relatively higher for phone/video-chat and sending texts. This relates to my community because I know some people in college who don’t live with their parents right now and it is often difficult for them to find time to contact their families but try to text or call them as much as they can. My headline for this graph would be: “Connecting Back Home - Is Contacting Parents a Priority?”."

I think it would be interesting to see a secondary graph that displays the average distance between where those polled live versus where their parents live.

    "original_comment": "1) I notice that in all categories young women are more likely to reach out than men. Young people most likely tend to reach out to a parent by sending texts, while they are least likely to visit in person. There are also noticeable gaps between the percentages of women and men. While for sending text only under 50% of young men reach out, just under 75% of young women send text. There is also a noticeable gap for phone or video-chat as only around ~30% of men reach out while over a little 50% of women do in contrast. Visiting in person had the least difference around 5% with percentages of 25 and under.\n\n2) Why are young women more likely than men? How would these people describe their relationships with their parents? \n\n3) As the family is a big part of many people's lives while we all may not be able to see all parts of family in person,  there are alternatives to reach out as we live in a modern digital world. Hence it may not always be convenient to visit in person, we can make phone calls and send texts. \n\n4) Going Digital: Keeping in Touch with Loved Ones"

I also wonder what age range these people are that answered. \n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\n\nThis has an impact on my community because we have phones that have access to reaching our parents but if we don't use them we can lose connection and relationships with people close to us. \n\n4.

The statistics for all three categories for women combine to over 100%, suggesting that many young women not only frequently communicate with, but utilize several different methods, to talk to their parents. This is much higher compared to men, where the sum of all 3 categories barely reaches 100%, meaning that young men do not as regularly communicate with their parents. This may be because, according to societal standards, women are raised to be more mindful of their family and are meant to be more sensitive to the physical and emotional needs of those around them. Men, on the other hand, are raised according to the social conception of masculinity to become independent and less openly emotional or communicative in their relationships, meaning that young adult men will be less likely to maintain a close relationship with their parents."

    "original_comment": "This graph shows how young men and women socialize with their parents through texts, phone calls, and in-person communication. I notice that women communicate with their parents more than men do in all forms. I wonder if this is because of built-in societal norms for women regarding their role in family and socialization. I also wonder how this chart would compare to a similar chart 30 years in the past. This relates to me and my community because I am almost entering the age range that these statistics are concerning, so it makes me sad that one day I won't see my parents every day. I think we take our families for granted a lot and I hope that I communicate with them on a normal basis when I get older. \n\"Staying Connected in 2024\""

    "original_comment": "The graph highlights a clear divide in communication frequency between young men and women with their parents. Across visits, texts, and calls/video chats, young women consistently reach out more frequently, with digital communication showing the largest gender gap, nearly 25% higher for women. This prompts questions about societal expectations and cultural influences shaping these patterns. Furthermore, the data suggests that in-person visits, while still less frequent overall, show a more modest discrepancy between genders. This raises questions about the significance placed on face-to-face interaction versus digital communication in parent-child relationships. Why do these gender differences manifest more prominently in virtual interactions? Reflecting on my own experience and community, I see the representation of young women, like myself, maintaining regular contact with parents, primarily through digital means due to distance. This underscores the importance of nurturing relationships beyond physical proximity, while also highlighting the need to address gender-based communication barriers within our community. A catchy headline is \"Dialing Differences: Exploring Gender Disparities in Parental Connection\"."

This is likely due to a variety of factors one of which I believe is that parents are more protective over their daughters compared to their sons. I would assume a good amount of these responses are from young adults whose parents require them to call or text at least once a week. There are a lot of things I wonder about the graph, one of them being if there is a difference between the teens and the people in their thirties. The survey targeted people from the ages 18-34, which in my opinion is a pretty large gap. I would be interested in learning how getting older affects how often you reach out to your parents.  There are many ways to categorize this data, in college or not in college, taken or single, and living in a different time zone or the same time zore are just some of the many ways that this data could be explored. I would also wonder if the survey counted reaching out if the young adult was just responding to a previous text from a parent. Reaching out, especially for texting, is a little ambiguous. Personally, I call parents at least once a week and text them very often throughout the week. I don't visit them due to the distance thought. This all lines up very well with the data. A title could be \"C'mon, they deserve a call\""

Another thing I notice is how the smallest gap appears with visiting in person. I suppose that visiting in person has less to do with gender and more to do with location. I wonder how they find the time to visit in person at least a few times a week, since even if you live relatively close, it can be hard to find the time to do so. And if someone did live that close, I wonder why they wouldn't just live with their parents to begin with. \nThis relates to me and my community as I'm a young college student living a few hours drive away from home.

    "original_comment": "From the graph, I noticed that the graph compares the frequency of communication between young men and young women with their parents. It looks at three modes of communication: sending texts, phone or video-chat, and visiting in person. Particularly, young women consistently communicate more frequently with their parents across all methods compared to young men. Texting is the most common method for both genders, with the largest gap in communication frequency observed here. The difference in frequency of in-person visits is the smallest, though it still shows that young women visit their parents more often than young men. I wonder why there is a noticeable difference in communication frequencies between genders. Are gender norms or upbringings influencing these patterns? Also, how might these patterns shift as people age beyond their 30s? What would the data look like if only considering those in their early twenties or college students? As a college student, my community is filled with mainly busy individuals and for many young adults, moving out from their parents' home marks a transition to more independence. However, the frequency of contact with parents can vary widely depending on individual circumstances like proximity, work schedules, and the nature of the parent-child relationship. A catchy headline that captures what’s going on in this graph is \"Staying Connected: Young Women Lead in Family Communication\"."

    "original_comment": "I notice that in this graph for every category young women reach out to their parents more often. I also noticed that for both genders, texting is the common form of communication with their parents. I think this must have to do with the convenience and mobility of texting, rather than sitting on a phone call or traveling home to see their parents. I notice that visiting their parents in person is the least common way of reaching out to a parent. I think this is because most people 18-22 are away from home at college making it not possible to visit home. And people 22-34 are typically working wherever they can find a job and often that is not in their hometown. \n\nI wonder why women have a higher overall percentage of reaching out than men. I also wonder if the proximity of your college to your hometown plays a role in communication. For example if someone visits their parents a few times a week, they may be less inclined to text or call their parents often. I would also be intrigued to know whether the kids in college in this study communicate more than the people working.\n\nThis relates to me because I am a male in college and I do call with my parents everyday so it is very interesting to see that I am in the minority of all males in the age bracket. I think keeping in touch with your parents is the best way to keep a strong relationship with them as being in college is different from our early lives where we saw them everyday.\n\nKeeping in Touch, Who Does It Best?"

    "original_comment": "This graph provides fascinating insights into the communication habits of young adults aged 18-34 who live independently from their parents. The data highlights notable differences between genders in their preferred methods of maintaining regular contact.\nAmong young women, texting emerges as the dominant mode of communication, with 100% reaching out to a parent via text at least once a day or a few times per week. In comparison, only around 75% of young men exhibit the same texting frequency. Young men show a higher inclination towards phone or video chats, with approximately 75% using these methods regularly, as opposed to only about 50% of young women.\nInterestingly, despite the prevalence of digital communication, a significant proportion of both genders, roughly 25%, still prioritize in-person visits with parents at least once a day or a few times weekly. This underscores the persistent value placed on face-to-face interaction in fostering close family ties. \nThe data presents a nuanced picture of a generation navigating independence while striving to maintain strong parental connections. \n\nAn interesting title may be: The Talk: Do Young Men or Women Talk More with Their Parents"

However, visits in person have a smaller difference between men and women, but women still have a higher percentage in this category by about 5 percentage points.\n\nI wonder why this phenomenon occurs. What is the reason much less young men reach out to their parents than young women? What factors into this? Is it due to the difference between how girls and boys are raised and socialized?\n\nThis is related to me and my community since I, along with nearly everyone I am surrounded with on a regular basis, am in the age range this graphic examines. The way my relationship with my own parents is changing as I no longer live with them is interesting to me and I have become more aware of how much I talk to my parents, so having an idea of what types of communication are common amongst my age range is interesting to keep in mind.\n\nTitle: “How Adulthood Changes Communication in Parent-Child Relationships. ”"

It's also apparent to me that the majority of youth would rather text or contact their parents than see them.\nI'm curious to know how these answers might vary with age. Given that it takes around 13 years to complete high school and enter kindergarten, the survey's age range of 18 to 34 represents a 16-year disparity. Would the likelihood of communication between the older and younger children with their parents be higher or lower?\nThere are a lot of individuals my age in my neighborhood who intend to attend college. It's intriguing to realize that, depending on the course we choose in life, we can eventually fall into one of these groups as someone who is leaving home rather far away. \nHow Do You Get in Touch With Your Parents?"

    "original_comment": "1) According to the graph I notice that out of the young adults who say they reach out to their parents every day or a few times a week, Young women tend to reach out to their parents more than young men. In the graph, young women tend to reach out 75% through text, more than 50% through phone/video chat, and a little more than 25% through in-person. In contrast, young men reach out less than 50% through text, less than 40% through phone/video chat, and less than 25% visit.\n2) I wonder why it is that young women tend to reach out more than young men. Could it be due to the phase of independence? Could a factor be the relationships with parents and young adults? How does the female and male persona tend to affect this result?\n3) This relates to my community and me because many are already in the young adult stage and in addition those are getting to the young adult stage who seem to be eager to explore their waiting and start to find their careers, earn money, and in general figure out the path ahead of them. \n4) Young Adults and Their Astonishing Levels of Involvement With Parents!"

    "original_comment": "First looking at the graphic, I noticed that for each form of communication, young women seemed to take the lead over young men in how often they reach out to their parents, whether through text, phone or in person. For instance, young women seem to send texts or talk on the phone with their parents 25% more frequently than young men. It appears that young women and young men are most similar in how often they visit their parents in person, with only about a 5% difference in frequency. Also, texting seems to be the most frequent form of communication for both young women and men. \nSomething I wonder about this graphic is why women tend to reach out more to their parents.  On top of that, I also wonder which parent they tend to reach out to more overall. For instance, I call my mom practically every day to keep her updated on my college life and then she'll just fill in my dad. However, this probably varies from person to person, and it would be interesting to see.\nThis relates to me as a person because out of my brother and I, I tend to reach out more to my parents. This could be because I'm the second child and therefore rely on my parents more for some things, but I also believe it does have something to do with me being a young woman versus my brother being a young man. Between the two of us, we accurately represent these statistics and that tends to go for a lot of boy/girl sibling relationships.\n\"Communication Trends: How Youth Stay Connected with Parents Across Genders\""

There is also a noticeable gap for phone or video-chat as only around ~30% of men reach out while over a little 50% of women do in contrast. Visiting in person had the least difference around 5% with percentages of 25 and under.\n\n2) Why are young women more likely than men? How would these people describe their relationships with their parents? \n\n3) As the family is a big part of many people's lives while we all may not be able to see all parts of family in person,  there are alternatives to reach out as we live in a modern digital world.

Texting has the highest percentage of both men and women who reach out to a parent at least once a week, and visiting in person is the least popular for both men and women. Additionally, I notice that for both texts and phone/video chat, the difference in proportion between women and men is the greatest, with women having a percentage about 25% higher than men. The in-person visit category has the smallest difference in percentage between women and men, with women only having about a 5% greater percentage than men. I wonder why women tend to communicate with their parents more often than men do. Does this maybe suggest that women also tend to be closer to their parents than men? I also wonder if those who visit in person do so because their parents may happen to live nearby or if many of the people in this category commute in order to be with their parents in-person. I am also curious to see how these statistics compare to those of teenagers, and if this would show any changes as teenagers enter into young adulthood. This impacts me as I am currently a college student and understand that it is important for my peers and I to remain in touch with our parents. A relevant headline could be “How young adults are staying in touch with their parents.”"

Additionally, I’m surprised to see how often young men and women who do not live with at least one parent visit their parent(s) in person. I was actually expecting to see lower percentages for this category. I wonder how this data would change if the age range wasn’t so wide. For example, young men and women could be categorized as 18-22 instead of 18-34 (i.e. college aged people). I feel like this result in higher percentages for sending texts/phone calls and less visits in person as most young people in college are far away from home. This graph is really intriguing to me! I’m currently a third-year in college and tend to call my parents a lot. Luckily, I’m close enough to home that I can visit pretty frequently though. I think other college students in my community would find this graph interesting as well. I wonder how much other students’ opinions of this graph deviate from mine. Catchy headline: “Texts, Calls, Visits: How Today's Youth Communicate with Their Parents”."

    "original_comment": "I noticed that the graph standardizes the scale of responses by using percentages instead of simply counting the number of responses. This allows for comparison between men and women, which I appreciate since it makes the graph more digestible for non-statisticians. I also noticed the ordering of the three methods of reaching out to convey the most common ways these young adults reach out to their parents. One thing I wonder is why women reach out to their parents at higher rates and how this potentially reflects the relationship that parents have with their female children versus their male children. I also wonder how we could incorporate other questions regarding communication with a parent into the survey as well, such as how qualitative the children believe their communication with their parent is. This relates to me as a college student because I struggle with making time to contact my parents (not on purpose) so I feel as though I cannot have the most interesting conversations with them, but I do believe it is nice to check in with them when I can. Furthermore, since I am away at college, I wonder how many of these survey respondents are college students and how that may affect how often they reach out to their parents as well.

Specifically, this gap is largest for sending texts and calling on the phone. Meanwhile, the difference for in-person visits is much smaller (about 5 percentage points). Both genders are more likely to communicate via text compared to any other method.\nI wonder why more women as opposed to men are willing to reach out to their parents. Is it because girls tend to form stronger bonds with their parents? Personally, I text or call my parents close to every day just to briefly check in with them, so this is the case for me. Other college students who also no longer see their parents daily, might not communicate as frequently because they are busy with their classes or work. Furthermore, everyone has a different relationship with their parents, so constant communication might be a low priority for some. I would name this graph “Leaving the Nest Does not Need to Mean Losing Touch”.\n\nOne last note is I wonder if the age range was reduced from 18-34 to instead be only individuals in college or even only individuals in their twenties would these percentages change? It might be interesting to see how when we look into smaller age ranges that encompass specific stages of people's lives, how people's interactions with their parents change."

Specifically, young women text their parents nearly 25% more frequently than their male counterparts. Regardless of the method,  we can see that young women are more likely to maintain contact with their parents compared to young men.\n\nI'm curious how these trends might vary by country, as cultural norms around family connections can differ widely. It would be intriguing to explore these dynamics in different global contexts. Additionally, examining this behavior in older age groups, such as those aged 35-40, could provide further insights. It would also be interesting to see how often mothers and fathers initiate contact with their children and whether similar patterns exist.\n\nAs a college student, I find it hard to keep in regular contact with my parents, but try to do so once every month.\n\nA potential catchy headline could be : \"Staying in Touch\""

Higher percentages of both genders seem to use text messaging the most and in-person visits the least. It surprised me that less than 50% of young men reach out to a parent at least once a week via text, call, or in person. The question under the title of the graph is \"How involved are parents in their children's lives?\". I wonder if higher percentages of women contact their parents more because parents are more involved in their female children's lives, if young women have stronger relationships with their parents than their male counterparts, or if women are simply better at communicating and staying in touch. This relates to our community because for most college students we are no longer living with our parents and seeing them everyday. Everyone has different family dynamics that affect how often they contact their parents, but maybe gender is a part of this too. What makes this  a good graph to it putting the y-axis label horizontally which makes the graph easier to read. Another aspect of the graph I like is how they used percentages to compare the data. Had the authors used counts or means or ratios, the viewer would have had to more interpretations of their own to figure out the story the graph is telling us.

    "original_comment": "I notice that, out of the young people who reach out to their parents at least once a week, that young women reach out a lot more than young men. In terms of how they reach out, young women send texts to a parent almost 25% more than young men who send texts. However, when it comes to visiting a parent in person, the gap between men and women is a lot smaller. According to the visual, young women are more likely to reach out to a parent, no matter how they do so, compared to young men.\n\nI wonder how this visual would change depending the country in which the people were surveyed. In some countries, it is more common to stay closely connected with family and would be interesting to see how this differs around the world. I also wonder what this graphic would look for an older age group such as 35-40. I think it would also be interesting to see how frequently mothers and fathers reach out to their kids and wonder if some of the gaps that we see in this visual would be the same.\n\nThis relates to me because, as a college student, I do find it really important to reach out to my parents frequently. However, it can be easily understandable that people in this age range can be busy and make it hard to frequently reach out to a parent, especially seeing them in person.\n\nA catchy headline could be \"Staying in touch: Why do young women seem to do it more frequently?\""

During this time, we'll start to become more independent from our parents: some will move out, or will just not be as home as often because of college, work, etc. Our lives will become busier so contact might be less. It's important that we try to maintain contact though, even if we're busy because our time with them is limited.\n\n4) Keeping Parental Contact in Adulthood"

    "original_comment": "The graph shows the percentage of young adults aged 18 to 34 who reach out to a parent at least once a day or a few times a week. It breaks down the communication methods into sending texts, phone or video-chat, and visiting in person. I noticed that while young women appear to reach out to their families at a higher rate than young men do, regardless of modality, that texting is the most common/ popular means of keeping in touch, as it has the highest percentages in either gender. \nVisiting in person shows the lowest gap between genders,  but is still less popular than other modalities.\nI wonder how the way that female and male children are socialized impacts the way and the frequency with which they stay in parents-- are girls more prone to keeping in touch because they spent more time with parents, or because they feel it is expected? Of the participants that has high rates of contact, how many of them were eldest or only children? \nThis resonates with me as my mom and I text nearly every day. Video and phone calls are harder to line up with different schedules, and in-person visits are the hardest-- we see each other a handful of times each year. Based on this, I'm inclined to think that schedule/ convenience has a decent weight behind the rates observed in this graph.\nI think a good headline could be, \"Texts and Calls: The New Bridge Between Today's Young Adults and Their Parents\""

But a commonality both have is preferring to send text messages while visiting in person might be a last option. \n\nI wonder what factors were looked at to choose the population for this study. Factors such as how far people lived from their parents, how good their relationship is with their parents, their job situation, if they're fathers/mothers themselves, etc.\n\nThis relates to me and my community as my community is very family oriented. This means it is very common in my community for people to reach out to their parents whether its call, text, or in person. But as my senior class transitions to college , in person contact will become more limited as we will start using texting and phone calls to communicate instead. \n\nHas Technology Caused Communicating to Become Completely Digital?"

This indicates that parents seem to be less involved in their kids lives (with the study already excluding those that don't keep contact with their parents).\n- I wonder how much culture plays into the number of parents involved in their children lives. The reason being that for many it is tradition to have a few generations living in one home at a time so the amount of families where this comes into play would be interesting to know. Furthermore, I wonder why females text their parents so much more than males, with it being the biggest gap between the two genders in the graph. \n- This relates to me and my community as many around me keep frequent contact with their parents entering adulthood so the results of the study are shocking compared to the culture here in the city.\n- Stay In Touch: Young Adults Keep Digital Contact"

The least popular method of reaching out to parents was visiting in person while the most popular method was sending texts. The smallest difference between young men and women was in the visiting in person category. \n\n2)I wonder how far the survey participants lived from their parents? Do jobs and college affect the methods of participants reaching out? \n\n3)In my community I know a lot of people around my age that plan on going to college. Depending on future plans some people plan on going to college nearby or going out of state. So, it is interesting to see that one day we may fit into one of these categories depending on what path in life we take. \n\n4)Staying Connected : How Today's Youth Keep Their Parents Involved"

While I personally enjoy my own space and distance from my family, I understand the importance of reaching out in a consistent manner. One thing that stood out to me was the fact that women tend to reach out to their parents more than men among all 3 communication methods. This made me wonder if males tend to view reaching out to parents as an \"intrusion\" into their independence. \n\nThis analysis is extremely relevant, as I am close in age to the ages investigated. Understanding this data can help tell us more about more than just preferred modes of communication with parents, such as why women tend to reach out to their parents more than men. Analyzing this type of data helps us formulate better questions to ask about our social environment.\n\nA good title for this graph would be, \"Reach Out to Your Parents: Are Women Better Communicators?\""

This could be due to traditional societal roles, where men are seen to have to not feel emotions and having to be independent at a younger age than women. That if they are in contact with their parents more, they may think they are seen as weak, even though that is not true. I also notice that visiting in person is the lowest for both young men and women, which is most likely due to them moving away for jobs and/or college and they are unable to visit as much. One thing I wonder is how these responses would change by age. The survey questions asked those 18 to 34, a 16  year difference, which is a pretty big considering that it takes roughly 13 years between kindergarten and end of high school. Would the older ones be more or less likely than the younger ones to be in contact with a parent? Also, how does where the respondent go to school or do for work affect their contact status. This graph makes me want to be in contact with my parents more. I am very fortunate to have a good relationship with both parents, one where I could text or call them easily. I do stay in contact with them, but not as often as I think I should. Even a quick 10-minute conversation would be good.

I also notice that visiting in person is the lowest for both young men and women, which is most likely due to them moving away for jobs and/or college and they are unable to visit as much. One thing I wonder is how these responses would change by age. The survey questions asked those 18 to 34, a 16  year difference, which is a pretty big considering that it takes roughly 13 years between kindergarten and end of high school. Would the older ones be more or less likely than the younger ones to be in contact with a parent? Also, how does where the respondent go to school or do for work affect their contact status. This graph makes me want to be in contact with my parents more. I am very fortunate to have a good relationship with both parents, one where I could text or call them easily. I do stay in contact with them, but not as often as I think I should. Even a quick 10-minute conversation would be good. A catchy headline could be, \"Parental Guidance – How Young Men and Women Differ in Contact with Parents.\""

    "original_comment": "The first thing that I notice is that young people need to talk to their parents more often! They’re not going to be here forever. I also noticed, and thought it was interesting, that girls tend to keep more in touch with parents than boys. I found that a little relatable. I still try to keep in touch with my parents, but I feel like younger boys might have more trouble doing that. I also saw that the percentage of young people who see their parents in person was the lowest out of all. Life does tend to get busier the more you grow older, and you might not live in the same place.\n\nI wonder and hope if we could get to a time where we really try to put an effort into seeing our parents and family. There’s only a certain amount of time we get with our loved ones, and it’s important we spend that time and cherish it while we can.\n\nThis relates to my community since I’m currently at college, just like all the other students here, and we may not see our family all the time since we’re away for school. It might be hard to make frequent calls, but I’m able to get a couple a week in.\n\nA catchy headline would be “Connected But Disconnected”."

    "original_comment": "Upon observing this graphic, my initial attention is drawn to the distinct color scheme employed to represent the statistics for men and women. The chosen colors create a clear contrast, enabling the audience to easily discern differences between the sexes. Additionally, I observe that the study's age range is confined to individuals aged between 18 and 34, which is likely to have influenced the outcomes presented in the graphic.\n\n\nI wonder why women between 18 and 34 tend to reach out to their parents more than men of that age. One aspect that I believe may be worth considering is the evolving role of women in society. Over the past century, there has been significant progress in women's rights and opportunities. In this context, maintaining strong ties with parents can provide a sense of stability, guidance, and emotional support amid life's challenges and transitions.\n\n\nThis study is particularly relevant to my community at Cal Poly because many of my peers fall within the age range under investigation and meet the criteria for participation. By delving into this data, we can gain insights that might reshape our perspectives and behaviors concerning communication with our parents. For instance, members of our community, particularly men, might reconsider their communication habits after reviewing this data and opt to initiate more frequent contact with their parents.\n\nHeadline: A Battle of the Sexes"
