    "original_comment": "From the graph, I noticed that legacy applicants have a significantly higher admissions rate across the board (over twice the average rate). However, those wither higher parental income had a proportionally larger benefit: up to 7 times the average for the top 0.1%, compared to less than triple (already high) for non-legacy. This leaves several burning questions: among them, why are admissions so heavily skewed in favor of high-income, legacy applicants, and what steps can colleges take to reduce this (likely-systematic) bias?"

However, I'm noticing that non-legacies with an income rank of about 85% are under 1 times as likely to be accepted into an elite college. \n\nAfter analyzing the graph, I wonder how these admissions numbers will be impacted over the next several years. After the Supreme Court case in June that eliminated affirmative action in terms of college admissions on the grounds of things like race, I'm curious to see how this will extend to legacy statuses. Legacies aren't necessarily considered to be disadvantaged, but non-legacies may be, so it'll be interesting to see if legacy admissions rise or drop. \n\nThis graph doesn't necessarily affect my immediate community very much, as I don't know anyone who was aiming to be accepted into a highly selective college. However, I do live in the general proximity of Rice University, which is a very selective college that likely exhibits admissions bias based on whether someone is a legacy and the income bracket that they are in. \n\nA headline that captures the graph's main idea might be \"Application Distortion: Legacies vs. Everyone Else.\""

The chances are significantly higher even for kids whose parents' income does not fall in the top 99%. Another thing that I noticed was for those who fell under the category of parents income between the 70th and 90th percentile actually had a lower admission rate than those who had slightly lower and higher income. I wonder why the mixture of being a legacy and your parents income being within the 99 percentile increases your chance far greater than any other combination shown in the graph. I see others around me in highschool spending countless hours perfecting their craft, studying till the break of dawn, volunteering and starting impactful foundations for their chances to be super seeded by those with legacy and their parents having being in a higher income range. A catchy headlines could be \"Silver Spoon Scholars: How legacy and Parental Wealth shines in College Admissions\"."

Additionally, the chance of admission for students with the greatest income is little over two times, which is insignificant when compared to legacy students who have a parent income rate of 99.9.\n2. I wonder about the role that money plays in the school's admissions process. Is there evidence of favoritism in the amount of legacy students being admitted? What distinguishes legacy students from non-legacy students as superior applicants? Does the admission of legacy students depend on the actions of their alumni at these schools?\n3. This is relevant to me and my community because I'm from an urban area, which means that many of my peers and classmates have not had the same luck as me in being legacy students or having parents who were alumni. As a result, admission is even more difficult for those who are already at a disadvantage due to circumstances beyond their control.\n4. Rags To Riches, Is Favoritism Ending Fair Chances?"

    "original_comment": "This graph depicts the likelihood of admissions advantages at some colleges compared to those with the same test scores and a legacy advantage. I noticed how a legacy student with wealthier parents who are in the top 0.1% of income would be 7x more likely to be admitted into a school compared to a less wealthy student. That definitely must annoy students trying to get into an elite college. I also noticed that regardless of income, legacy applicants were admitted significantly higher than those without legacy status. I noticed that students who have a legacy advantage are more wealthy compared to those without a legacy advantage. I wonder how this could be and why there is a lesser legacy for students with low income. Maybe it could be because the wealthier applicants can afford high tuition costs and donate money to the elite college whereas the low-income ones would struggle and would request financial aid.  I wonder how income and legacy advantages affect a student getting into an elite college in the admission process. Like if you request financial aid are you more likely to be deferred or rejected? This affects me and my community because I am a sophomore who is starting to research college so next year I will be applying and looking at schools. Also, I have 2 older sisters who have applied to colleges without a legacy advantage and got in. But my family friend with a legacy advantage for Villanova as her uncle went there, got differed. \nTitle of graph: Legacy"

For those who are not legacies, the admittance rate goes down before going back up at around the 90th percentile. I'm not sure why this is. Maybe universities try to accept students who are either extremely wealthy or poor. \nAs someone who is looking to go to college, I don't want to be impaired by something I can't control, such as how much money my parents make.

Also how the families who are the richest and have the best legacy connections tend to have the absolute best chances of getting in over everyone else even if they have the same test scores. What I wonder is how having a lot of money and being a legacy have changed over the course of history. Did it used to always be this way? This affects my community because I was recently applying to colleges a few months ago and I was wondering how all of these factors could affect my application process as well.

What do you wonder?\nWhat test was used?\nWhat were the scores? \nWhy did they choose only these schools? \nDid they account for the fact that some schools only removed their legacy policy in the later dates of the range of which they studied, which would skew the data? \nIt’s highly unlikely that test scores are the only thing that influences admission, so what other variables could be impacting admission, such as their essay, resume, etc.? \n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nSince I am a senior and I am applying to college, for elite colleges, I am often competing with applicants who have legacy. This makes it harder for me to get into the colleges that I want because those with legacy have a higher chance of getting in, which then lowers my own chance of acceptance. \n\n4.

I also notice that the upper middle class (75-90th income rank) has a lower than average admission rate. The admissions rate tends to be higher than average for poorer and richer families.\n\nI wonder when admission rates became so much higher for legacy students; did the trend start when admissions became more selective? I also wonder why the upper middle class is disadvantaged in college admissions. Is there anything being done to mitigate the legacy boost? Also, do the top  0.1% also fare better because they have more money to invest in extracurriculars and tutoring?\n\nThis relates to me and my community because I will enter college soon. Since my classmates and I will be competing against legacy students who have a much higher likelihood of getting into selective schools, this may hurt our chances at admissions.\n\nThis graph shows the disparate admission rates at elite colleges for legacy and nonlegacy students, as well as between the rich and the poor.\n\n\"The Golden Touch: College Admissions\""

So, it seems that schools care deeply about passing on the legacy of attending their school.\nWhat do you wonder? I wonder why being in the 70 to 90th percentile decreases the chance of being accepted. Your parents obviously have more money to afford the school. Why would the school decrease the number of students in the income bracket?\nHow does this relate to you and your community? As a gymnast, who is not a legacy applicant to the colleges I would like to attend, I am trying to get admitted using a non-traditional way by being recruited for gymnastics. This would allow me to circumvent many issues like not being a legacy applicant.\nHeadline that describes the graph: Elite College Admissions Unveiled"

I wonder why there is less of a legacy boost for students with parents below the 50th percentile of income rank. Perhaps the ability of the wealthier to donate a greater amount of money impacts the graph. The effect of financial aid could be another possible explanation for this.

I wonder how income factors into the school's decisions as to who is admitted and who isn't. Does the number of legacy students being admitted suggest nepotism? What makes legacy students better applicants than non-legacy students? Does it matter what the alumni did at these schools for the legacy students to get admitted?\n3. This relates to me and my community as being from an urban community it means that a number of my classmates/peers have not had the same fortune of being legacy students/having parents that were alumni thus making admission that much harder for those already at a disadvantage for something completely out of their control (with parental/guardian income also being completely out of these students control). \n4.

    "original_comment": "This graph shows the relationship between elite colleges and their tendency to choose applicants based on economic status and family legacy. The black line (legacy applicants) is significantly higher than the gray line (non-legacy applicants), indicating that elite schools favor legacy. Legacy applicants appear to automatically have double the chance of acceptance. It also is apparent that both types of applicants have a spiked chance of getting into an elite college when their parent’s income surpasses the 90th percentile. One thing that stood out to me was that applicants without legacy status who fall into the middle-class range have less of a chance of getting into an elite college versus an applicant with poorer or richer incomes. Do colleges discriminate against middle-class applicants because they are not rich enough to generate a lot of money but not poor enough to even out their statistics in appearing to be a school that caters to all financial statuses? This relates to me because as a current senior applying to college, I have had to witness students get into colleges just because of their legacy status and or because their parents have a higher income. Even though we may have the same statistics, colleges will always choose the legacy/richer applicant. This has hurt all students, not just me, and our disadvantage when it comes to being a middle class without legacy status when applying to elite colleges. \n\n“College: The Legacy of a Rich Man’s World!”"

If your notice includes a claim, please back it up with evidence that supports your claim.  By Friday morning, we’ll reveal the free link to the online article that included these graphs, shout outs for some of the  catchiest headlines and more.  \n\nYou can get a link to your response to share with your teacher and classmates by clicking the response box below your response “Email me when my comment is published.”  \n\nThe next graph will be released by Friday, February 2 with live moderation on Wednesday, February 7.

I also notice there isn’t my change based on income at any point below the top 5%. Finally I notice that strangely income has a much greater effect for legacy applicants than it does for normal applicants. \n2. I wonder why there is such a difference between normal and legacy applicants as you would expect the college to accept the best applicants and not those with parents who went there previously. I also wonder how income can affect admissions so greatly, I wonder if it is because they have more support to build a better application or if it's actually part of the admissions calculations. Finally I wonder why income hurts your chances as a normal applicant (until top 5ish percent) though it boosts your chances as a legacy applicant. \n3. Admission to college is very important to me and to many other students in my community. The majority of us are not legacy applicants and if there is truly this great disadvantage that comes with this fact it would greatly damage the hopes of many students in my district. Additionally my district is very split on parents' financial status and truly this shouldn’t be affecting admissions as I don’t think the most supported kids are very often the smartest or hardest working students. \n4.

For students of parents who have a mid to high income, legacy has a significant boost on their acceptance rates. I wonder why legacy is so important to these colleges. Parents and their children can differ significantly in character traits and personalities, which makes the idea of legacy a questionable way to admit students. If these colleges' goal is to attract and accept the most intelligent, talented, and skilled students, why is such an emphasis placed on legacy? It seems irresponsible of these colleges to accept based on legacy and unfair to the multitude of highly talented students who are rejected because they lack legacy."

Meanwhile the lower the income a family may have the likelihood of getting accepted into college is lower. As well as any applicants with legacy's have up to 7 times the chance of getting accepted into college. While applicants without a legacy only are 2 times more chance of getting accepted into college.\n\n2. I wonder why colleges have a \"favorite\" with the higher income applicants, why should they be highly accepted while the low income applicants don't? At the end of the day both of the applicants are going to end up paying a similar amount of money at college. So, why not give an equal amount of chances to the applicants, since they are also similar if we look at it at an academic level.\n\n3. This relates to me and my community because for many people  in my town which include my family, we normally come from different countries and due to such reason  some families may not have a high income compared to others. But, any applicant should have the equal amount of probability of getting accepted into any college, since in order to get into college the only thing colleges should worry about applicants is their grades.\n\n4.

I also recognize how leacy helps students get accepted, as for those who do not have it, they get under the average admission rate.\n2. I wonder how far does having a higher income take you. For instance, if you are rich but you do not meet the college requirements, will they still accept you for your income as if you have a lower income but you meet all the requirements?\n3. This is relevant to my community because it contributes to social inequality by limiting educational opportunities for those who have a lower income. It's not fair that just because you have a higher income, you mostly get accepted to college compared to someone who struggles financially. This creates an environment where success is tied to a higher income.\n4. \"The Secret to Instant Admission Revealed!\""

Also, up until roughly the 85th percentile for Parents’ income rank, there is a decrease in the likelihood to be admitted, whereas there is on average a consistent likelihood to be admitted after the legacy boost. Finally, after the 85th percentile, there is an increase in admission likelihood for both students with and without the legacy boost, although there is a more drastic increase for those with the legacy boost.\nI wonder why the likelihood of admittance for legacy applicants remains close to constant for most of the graph. Why does the likelihood of admittance drop so drastically for non-legacy applicants around the 70th Parent’s income rank?\nFor people from my community, this shows that those with parents who graduated from selective schools are more likely to be admitted than those whose parents did not graduate from a selective school. We could also generalize this to more than just the twelve selective schools and say that applicants are more likely to be admitted to a school if their parents graduated from there. \n“Systemic generational bias in higher education”"

I wonder if someone with superior grades or a more remarkable resume can overcome a  family legacy.\n\n3) This affects me and my community since I know several students who will be the first in their families to attend college. My town isn't exactly wealthy, so how will they achieve their goal if legacies are preferred? My community will have a harder time if rates continue to rise at the same rate as the expected legacy increase. \n\n4) Did you get accepted into college or are you just a legacy?"

    "original_comment": "I notice how legacy applicants with parents of higher income have a much higher chance of being accepted than that of someone \"poorer\" or a regular applicant. I wonder why it is more important to accept those whose parents have attended. Children aren't always the same as their parents. So why is there such a high chance for these higher income legacy applicants when there isn't a guarantee that they'll be similar. These legacy applicants could even be less academic than their parents. People who aren't legacy applicants though, such as myself, would have no where near as good of a shot without being a legacy applicant. This relates to me because as a Junior, I need to start looking for colleges. Not being a legacy applicant will affect my options greatly. A catchy headline for this could be: Status over Smarts?: Is being a legacy applicant more important than being academically smart?"

It is both interesting and tiresome to see that just because of a student's income and legacy status, they might have a better chance of getting into college. It is sad that students that have scores and resumes on the same level may get rejected from certain colleges and universities because of things that they cannot control.\n\n4.Should Legacies Be the Only Ones to Leave a Legacy?"

Whereas those with no legacy and a poorer status have a significantly lower possibility of being admitted into these elite colleges. In the graph, as parents' income rank continues to increase, applicants with a legacy can be up to 7x more likely to be admitted to elite colleges compared to those who have no benefits and no legacy which only fall into a little more than 2x probability of being admitted.\n2. Even though all students had the same test scores, I wonder why colleges choose to accept those with an overall financially stable background rather than giving an equal opportunity to all students. Is this due to colleges believing that wealthier students will be able to pay off any college debt compared to poorer students?\n3. This relates to me and my community because being that high schoolers are preparing to take on important decisions when choosing their dream colleges, these aspects that colleges are looking at can affect the acceptance rate of their admissions being accepted. \n4.

    "original_comment": "I noticed that for legacy applicants, they are 7x as likely to be admitted as opposed to applicants without legacy status, meaning that if an applicant had relatives with a history of attending a certain elite university such as Ivy Leagues, then they had a much higher chance of being accepted compared to an applicant who did not have any prior legacy status in their family. Also, the richer an applicant's parents' income rank was and the more upper class they were, the higher the chance they were to be admitted into an elite college, even under the scenario of students with the same test scores. \n\nI wonder why it's harder for applicants without legacy status to be admitted into the same university with the same scores as others who have family or are a apart of generations in their family that have a history of attending the elite college that they are currently applying too. While I do understand why generations of a family might wish to all attend the same prestigious school, I don't think it's fair to other applicants who work just as hard but are simply the first of their family to apply and wish to be admitted. However, I think that this current statistic very likely has to do with elite colleges wishing to keep their students \"elite\", and the fact that most legacy status applicants most likely come from wealthy families that are able to use connections and legacy history to their advantage. \n\nPt. 1- Questions 1 & 2 (My response was too long sorry :D)"

This may be caused by two things, either the school admits more students in higher income families because they believe the parents might make sizable donations to the school, or it is because more higher income families can afford to send their children to elite colleges and poorer families can't and do not apply."

The evidence for this is clearly shown on the furthest right end of the graph when it increases exponentially starting at around 90th percentile or top 10%.  This is even more dramatic when those people are legacy applicants.    I wonder if colleges will ever truly not take legacy into account and give everyone equal opportunities regardless of whether their family attended the school.  This relates to me and my community because this means we have less chance of getting into those kinds of high-end colleges compared to someone who is a legacy and also extremely rich.

Whether you are legacy or not, your wealth provides you a significant advantage in getting in. Legacy students who are also wealthy see an even more significant boost in admission likelihood, around 7x than the average. I wonder if colleges had less monetary incentive  if the admissions rate for legacy students would be lower. Both of these factors can prevent average people who don't have historically wealthy families from climbing climbing the income ladder. \n\nIs legacy privilege unfair to average families?"

But, when money is added to the picture, non-legacy applicants that come from poorer families have a higher chance of being admitted than wealthy non-legacy applicants.This trend is shown throughout with the top 0.1% being 7x more likely to get in than someone with comparing attributes but no legacy.\n\nI wonder why the colleges pay attention to the students' background and income more than their test scores. If a non-legacy student had a higher test score than a legacy student would it convince the colleges to admit them over the legacy student?\n\nThis relates to me and my community because as a high schooler, we are preparing to enter college and pursue a career meaning people my age or older have to take in consideration of these details, we must be aware of our possibilities and take advantage of what we can. \n\n\nLegacy Status Is The Leeway to College! How Is This Fair To Others!\n\nWealthy in Knowledge or Wealthy in Reputation?"

However, students with legacy status do not fully follow the trend.  The admittance rate for legacy status students often rises with the income of their parents; if you are among the top 0.1%, your chances are nearly doubled.\n2)I wonder why the admissions process to Ivy League colleges is so competitive; the likelihood of being accepted increases dramatically with income. I believe this is the case because elite universities want wealthy students, and wealthy parents will undoubtedly pay them a lot of cash to get their inferior kids into such esteemed institutions. I believe that institutions have the conceited right to raise tuition and elevate their status when so-called \"elites\" enroll in Ivy League schools.\n3)This is relevant to my town as a large number of individuals there are preparing to enter college, and if this is taken into account when making admissions decisions, it might lead to issues with college admittance.\n4) \"Dear College Am I Rich Enough For You\""

I also notice that the extremely wealthy legacies, ie; the 0.1 percentile are nearly 7x more likely to be accepted. Considering that elite colleges have an acceptance rate of about 3.3% to 7.3%, the acceptance rate for rich legacies is about 23.1% to 51.1%. This is important because traditionally, people who go to elite colleges are more likely to be rich in the future. The boost given to wealthy people and to legacies is meant to keep the class divide obvious and the school selective. \n \n2)\nI wonder if this legacy boost exists in every single college. What would happen if each college had an individual graph plotting the difference between legacy and non-legacy? Does this bias go on to affect other things at the college, like grades, clubs, etc? Why is there a dip in the graph at around 50th and below the 90th?  What is it about these top 0.1 percentile legacies that makes colleges so incredibly drawn to them?\n\n3)\nThis relates to my and my community because I am planning to go to college one day, and being a middle class non-legacy, it feels discouraging to apply to Ivy League and other elite schools. And even if I were to get accepted into these schools, many of the people I would be attending with would also be extremely wealthy, leading to a difference in experience and in values. \n\n4)\n\"Are You Rich?

    "original_comment": "I notice that according to the graph the children who come from the top 0.1% of wealth in America are 7 times more likely to be admitted in elite colleges.  I wonder if the mode for the poor population of students are targeted by colleges or if its just by chance. For the poor population the 30th percentile mark has the highest chance to be admitted to a college. The chance proceeds to decline before and after that percentile only ascending again when it goes to the 70th percentile. This relates to me and my community because many people in Perth Amboy come from the lower financial side. It is very discouraging to realize that even though my peers and I are very educated and intelligent our application to elite colleges are looked differently than of an application that comes from wealth. \nColleges Care About your $$$$"

There is a significant trend indicating how legacy students are far more likely to be admitted into ivy league colleges. The second thing I noticed is how rich-non legacy kids are less likely to be admitted compared to poor-non legacy students. The third thing I notice is how the percentage of rich-legacy students have the biggest advantage in getting into the Ivy League.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why the admission officials care so much about legacy. Does it increase profit? I also wonder why more wealthy kids who have no legacy have less of a chance of being admitted into college. \n\nHow does this affect me and my community?\nMy classmates and I are going to be starting the college process very shortly and knowing the chances with legacy and whatnot can be a huge factor. It makes many students ask the question- “do I have less of a chance of getting into a college because I have no legacy and no wealth”? It seems to create an unfair advantage to me and my community which is very concerning to some.\n\nHeadline\nWealth and legacy- is this mainly what admissions care about?"

After the 50th percentile, while the chances to get admitted for legacy students went up, it had gone down for students without the status. Students without the status chances of being admitted had decreased the richer their families were, even going below average until after the 90th percentile of parents' income rank as their chances rose again. \n\n2) Why is the legacy status valued more? Why did the chance of being admitted decrease so much for normal students between the 70th and after the 90th percentile of parents' income? How many students hold the legacy status in these schools?\n\n3) As many people are applying to college, it seems rather unfair that they'll have fewer chances of being admitted if they don't have the legacy status. As applying to elite schools is already very competitive, it is a great disadvantage as normal students also do the hard work getting the same grades, yet have less chances of getting in. When in all ways, students with legacy status always have the benefit of the doubt if they'll get in or not.\n\n4) The College Admission Game: Perks of Being Legacy Status"

Also, when your parents or another close relative went to that college, the chances of getting accepted are about doubled for every income level. Additionally, I notice a subtle increase in acceptance rates at the low end of the income spectrum, presumably because of financial aid.\n\nI wonder why the Ivy League college system is like this; your chances of getting in are significantly larger if you’re extremely wealthy. I think it’s because the colleges like to have rich people attending their schools and the rich surely pay them a large amount of under-the-table money to get their sub-par children into such renowned schools. I think when so-called “elites” attend the Ivy Leagues, colleges then have the self-adorned right to raise tuition and make their school more prestigious.\n\nThis relates to me because I am a high school junior looking to go to a good college and I am curious about acceptance rates vs. income and other factors, such as the legacy status. My entire community is mostly just my school and a small town, so I suppose many of the people in my community (at least those whom I regularly interact with) would be concerned about similar issues within the elite college community.\n\nCatchy headline: Ive League Colleges: Wealthy in Knowledge or Wealthy in Reputation?

I wonder how these elite universities are able to skirt around the obvious equity/ ethicality, and discrimination problems this highlights? Universities are not allowed to take bribes. So how is this allowed? I will very soon also be applying to university, and the knowledge of how different income levels could be a basis of discrimination in certain colleges may help me narrow down which one(s) I would feel comfortable attending.

Something like TikTok?\n3) This relates to me because my older sister attends the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League school. In addition, the graph is relatable because if she didn't excel in high school and had multiple extracurriculars, she would've had to pay like 50,000 USD. Still, instead, she had about the whole thing covered and now only has to pay around 2,000 USD.\n4) petition to abolish college tuition"

We also notice that applicants are more likely to be admitted if their parents' income rank is among the highest overall.\n\nWe wonder why is the Estimated Legacy Boost much higher between richer people who are legacy applicants and who aren't versus between poorer people who are legacy applicants and who aren't?\n\nThis relates to our community because in our high school, majority of the students come from middle-class income families and could have a chance at being accepted into elite colleges. The distribution of admission rates shows that elite colleges have hidden preferences over legacy students versus non legacy students, as well as richer families being more accepted than poorer families. Since we come from middle-class families, we should be more unsure about our chances of admission if we apply to an elite college, especially that we may not have a legacy boost to.\n\nHeadline: \"The Real Reason You Didn't Get Into an Elite College.

    "original_comment": "I noticed that elite colleges pay attention to a whole lot more than your grades and test scores. They look at how rich your parents are or how poor. Also, they look at if they have gone to their school or any elite school before. Depending on those results you may be more or less likely to be accepted. \n\nI wonder why they base their decisions based off of parental income and where their parents went. What does that do with the current kid? Are we really just going to trash his application based off of a background he or she has absolutely no control over?\n\nThis relates heavily to me because I am a student with grades applicable to elite colleges and schools and knowing that they are going to base my acceptance based on our income amount and where my parents went to school can be a very important thing to consider. Knowing I am already at a disadvantage because of that makes me realize just how much harder I and many other students in the same situation have to work to get ahead of these other more privileged students.\n\nElite Schools Throwing Away Elite Applicants for Family Legacies."

However, non-legacy applicants who come from poorer families have a better chance than non-legacy applicants who come from wealthier families except for the very rich. The very rich non-legacy applicants have the best chance overall out of the non-legacy applicants.\nI wonder if the college looks at the students' backgrounds. Is this why the legacy applicants have a better chance? Would having higher test scores than a legacy applicant still put you at a disadvantage? How much does income really compare to legacy status?\nThis relates to me because I am a high school student who is going to be applying to colleges soon. I want to know how much income and legacy will really affect my chances at different colleges. This relates to my community because my friends are going to have to go through the exact same process.

Furthermore, out of those legacy students, the children whose family has a higher income and makes more money are chosen above the others. A legacy student with a family income in the 99th percentile is 7x more likely to be admitted than the average student with the same test scores. \nI wonder why the colleges are prioritizing financial status when students apply for college. Why has our country’s education system turned away from helping educate students and form capable adults? Why is making more money a bigger priority than equality? I wonder how and if we can fix this inequality. Our country is based off of the idea of equal opportunity, and yet this is anything but equal. \nThis affects me as an upcoming senior looking into colleges. It is discouraging knowing that no matter how much I study, other students will still have an unfair advantage. This affects my research in which colleges I might apply to. Knowing I might have a better chance as a legacy student is unfair, but an advantage that some might not help but to exploit. Knowing this data is frustrating, yet it is an advantage to be well informed going into college searches. \n“College Acceptance : the turn from equality and opportunity to moneymaking and legacy”"

I noticed the richer they are, the higher the boost will get as well, the top .1% has 7 times the chance of getting admitted.\n2. I wonder why students haven't complained about how unfair it is to get into an elite school. I also wonder just how much money a rich legacy parent must donate so that schools turn their eye and let students in. I wonder how much of a factor test scores make for admissions.\n3. This affects my community as a senior as we are looking to get into colleges and have to see the competition we are getting put up against. Rich non legacy students have a lesser chance of getting into the elite schools because they dont fit the criteria of poor diverse students they want to make their school look good or rich legacy students which can throw money at them.\n4.  \"Is College Rigged\""

As we are approaching senior year, the college application process is less than a year away. While it may not contribute any useful information to my applications, it highlights the inequalities in the admissions process. Especially when considering elite colleges such as the ones polled, it alters my perspective of the identity of the university.

    "original_comment": "One of the things I noticed about this graph is that without the legacy boost, in around the 70-80th income rank it actually drops, but in the same spot, it grows for legacy students. I also noticed that the x-axis consistently grows by twenty until the end where it only grows by 9.9. I think they did this to make the system seem more rigged than it is. One thing I wonder is how this has changed over time, gotten better or worse, etc. This relates to me/and my community because it shows that the college system is unfair and that will affect basically everyone who applies to colleges. I would name this: A Look Into Unfair Biases In Colleges."

Also, for non-legacy applicants, the ranking with the second highest chance of being accepted is 30th, and the lowest is between 80 and 90, which shows that it's not a perfectly direct correlation between how rich you are and how likely you are to get into the school. However, for legacy applicants, the line is more extreme and favors richer students more.\n- I wonder how this data was collected and why both lines have a tiny peak right before they get really steep. Additionally, I wonder if the problem would be solved by colleges not having access to parents' income information or whether the applicant is a legacy. The latter would be harder to accomplish, but it seems like withholding the info about money would be relatively easy.\n- This relates to my community because I interact with both people who might be legacy applicants and people who might be the first in their family to go to college. The fact that these people would have different chances of getting into an elite college despite having the same test scores is truly frustrating and unfair.  \n- My headline is \"Affluent Legacy Applicants Receive Extreme Advantages in Elite College Admissions\""

    "original_comment": "1. I notice how non-legacy applicants from the 10th to 65th percent have a 2x advantage of being accepted in the universities compared to non-legacy applicants from the 65th to 90th. The graph decreases from the 65th to 90th percent income applicants, explaining how richer students are disadvantaged in college acceptance even with the same test scores. After the 90th to the 99th percent, acceptance significantly increases to approximately 2.5 times more.\n\nFor legacy applicants, the average admissions rate on the poor side begins at 2.5x. Unlike the non-legacy students, the chance of being accepted as a legacy student increases from 3x to 3.5x after 50 percent. A similar outstanding increase at the 99th percentile is also illustrated, reaching 7x the likelihood of being admitted!\n\n2. I wonder why the two lines went in opposite directions after reaching the 50th percent of income. Why did the legacy applicants have an advantage while the non-legacy applicants had a disadvantage after 50? Have colleges made an effort to change this system of discrimination since 2015? I also wonder if the families in the 99th percentile are admitted for the funding they can offer to the school.\n\n3. This article relates to me because when I apply to universities, being a legacy or non-legacy student for specific schools and my parents' income would significantly affect my admissions.\n\n4. Are you disadvantaged in being accepted into some of the most prestigious universities in the United States?"

How does this compare year by year?\nCommunity: This impacts the community because if you want to get into an elite college, but you are not a legacy student or come from a poorer background, but have the same test scores of a legacy student who comes from a richer background, you may be more likely to be rejected.

    "original_comment": "What do you notice?\nIn general, rich and legacy applicants are much more likely to be accepted than poorer and/or non-legacy applicants. The acceptance rate for legacy students generally increases the wealthier the family, while the acceptance rate for non-legacy students curves down before spiking. Both types of students acceptance rates spike at the 99.9th income rank.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nAt around the 85th income rank, the admission likeliness for non-legacy students drops below the average admissions rate. I wonder why it drops below at that particular income rank, and not the less-wealthy applicants - could financial aid have something to do with it?\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community? \nThis relates to me because I'll be applying to college pretty soon, and it's important to know the underlying discrimination of the college admissions process that only continues to grow more relevant. \n\nCatchy Headline:\nThe Inequality in \"Equally-Qualified\" Students"

I wonder what benefits does it bring to a school if a kid has money or a legacy? How might this compare to a graph of non-elite colleges?, I’d assume that they might be less influenced by money considering they have less of a legacy.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\n\nIn my community people use what college their family attends/ attended as a way to compare people, but this graph has shown me that if it not a fair comparison because of the obvious influence that money and relations has on prestigious schools.\n\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\n\nHow your families financial situation can influence your education opportunities."

I wonder if this happens because kids with wealthier parents have more money for better education. I also wonder if it has to do with dropping out because of mental illness which can be more common in poorer accommodations. This relates to me and my community because while I go to a school that offers scholarships and is welcoming no matter how wealthy the family is, I know many people don't live like that. Many students get bullied for how much or little money they have. This graph shows the bias in our community toward the wealthy, often because they are able to afford a better education. While people may think that that's fair, it's not really because the parents of these children likely work just as long if not longer than the top 0.1%. The difference is that the top 0.1% was able to make a money harvesting company that the lower class people may not have been able to do because of the bias in society.

A parent-income between 50% and 85% seems to work against the student, and the chance of admission without legacy is exceptionally low. \n\nI wonder why the legacy boost also dips around the 85% percentile and if donations to colleges increase as parents' income exceeds the 85% mark.\n\nI also wonder what the exact student numbers of legacy vs. non-legacy are for every parent-income number. If legacy is a relatively small number of students, it may be justified for colleges to give this boost to a few ex-students who donated to or otherwise helped their college.\n\nHeadline: The Multi-Generational Benefit of an Ivy League Education.\n\n(And the resulting stress to \"break in\"!)"

To some extent you can guess that this may apply to most if not all schools and that will affect college choices that are considered and what school counselors and teachers tell their students about where they should apply and where they might not get in for one reason or another.\n\nHeadline: Legacy and Income: How these 2 factors can change whether you get into your top college or not"

Interestingly enough, the admissions rate for the same income brackets of legacy applicants do not follow this trend but rather continually get higher until reaching the extremes.\nI wonder of what the admissions graph would look like if instead of using the income percentiles, the graph used fixed yearly salaries. According to what I saw in the bottom of the page, the 99 or 99.9 percentiles represented those with an income of 620k+, I would be interested to see how admissions rates change in the millions or tens/hundreds of millions range. I believe that this graph relates to Texas in the way that many students in this state, regardless of socioeconomic status, do not even apply to out-of-state colleges in the first place. Many students are happy to stick with applying with their regional legacy schools. As being from an immigrant family in Australia with no prior experiences of the American College system, I find it interesting regarding the state boundaries that many confine themselves to as the equivalent state/province boundaries in Australia are nowhere near as considered.

    "original_comment": "It doesn't seem to have occurred to anyone that the most prestigious colleges are that way because of who they admit, and changing that is not going to give an advantage to those who were formerly not admitted, but will simply make these schools no longer prestigious.\n\nThat is, it is plausible that Harvard graduates are desirable because Harvard screens its applicants for desirability, not because of the education they get once they are there. It's a similar fallacy for all highly selective schools - if a school only allows in the best students (for whatever meaning of best you like), the school and it's teachers don't have to be any good, because the best students will excel regardless."

However, I noticed that the students whose parents had an income rank that was in the 50th rank or the middle rank had less of a chance of being admitted into the college.\n\n2. I wonder why the legacy students' whose parents' income rank was in the middle of the rank or in the 50th rank had less of a chance of admission than the other legacy students with a lower or higher rank. Is this graph telling us that there is a possible abundance of legacy students with parents who are in the 50th income rank? Are people in the middle class experiencing some form of discrimination in the college process? Are we experiencing injustice or high demand?\n\n3. This relates to my community in a great deal of ways. I am currently in high school and I plan to go to college. I am aware that college isn't the goal for all high school students, but I know that many students future plans include going to college. The people I surround myself with are mostly all academically motivated and are all trying very hard to make themselves appealing to colleges. We constantly strive to get good grades and fill our schedules with clubs and extra curriculars, while simultaneously keeping a social life. We are in high school after all.\n\n4. ARE THE CHANCES OF BEING ADMITTED TO COLLEGE CONNECTED TO INCOME AND LEGACY?"

This may be, a legacy applicant may have someone who exceeding very well and choosing the safer option would benefit the schools Elite status as well as keeping bonds with these families.\n\nI wonder, how likely are the chances for a legacy applicant to be turned down at an Elite college? Also what are the chances that a regular applicant would be chosen over a legacy applicant?\n\nThis relates and differs to me because at my high school there are blended income rates along with the same opportunities and  the same education. \n\nA Headline can be \" Are the same opportunities given to everyone?\""

This could be for a variety of factors such as the fact that hire income families don't require scholarships and have access to more tutoring and educational resources, therefore getting better grades and more likely to give the school mor money. These reasons should not cause an equally hard working student with less resources, less connections, and less money, but of the same intelligence to not be admitted. Unfortunately this is not the case. It is also important to note that statistics can be very easily skewed and data is hard to collect 100% accurately so we still do not know the exact statistics and factors that go into these decisions."

In addition, I'm curious as to why, up until approximately the 50th percentile, neither graph changes significantly; after that, they start to diverge until the 99th percentile. In my neighborhood, I can relate to this because I'm a high school student approaching the age when students need to start thinking seriously about college.

The acceptance chance for the super wealthy is much higher regardless of legacy or not, though significantly higher with legacy.\n\nI wonder why politicians are so concerned with the “unfair advantage“ that affirmative action gave when legacy acceptances are conveniently overlooked. “Shouldn’t we reward people based on their hard work and not luck of the draw?” A familiar argument used this past summer when affirmative action was overturned. But is being a person of color “luck of the draw”? Or is being a legacy, the majority of which are white, wealthy individuals not upholding systemic inequality?\n\nI know a lot of legacy students and a lot of students who have been admitted into top 20s/Ivies on merit. Most of the legacy students I know are white, privileged, and relatively less accomplished than those who aren’t. In no way am I saying that legacy students are not as smart or as talented, but there is a clear favor towards these students.\n\n“Lucky in Legacy: An Ivy’s four leaf clover”"

You can tell from the graph that having a parent attend that college raises the applicant's chances significantly, but interestingly, it most affects the rich. This is most likely because wealthy people tend to donate to their alma mater, especially when they have a child hoping to attend that school.  This shows how the college selection process has become increasingly biased and no longer based on the student and their accomplishment. Money makes the world go around, and colleges are businesses, so income is their main focus. The more wealthy can provide this, especially when their multigenerational legacies and alumni of these institutions. I would title this graph: \"College Admissions: Money Talks.\""

After looking closely at the graph above (or at this full-size image), answer these four questions:\n\nWhat do you notice?- I noticed that if you're rich and have family that went there, you're golden. If you're rich with no family, you still have a chance. If you're not rich with family, you have a chance, and if you're not rich and don't have family who went there, it's over for you pal.\n\nWhat do you wonder?- I wonder if things would be different if they stopped taking parental income into the equation.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?- I live in a town where many people went to ivy league schools so this isn't super new information. Lots of students are pushed to go to ivies because their parents went.\n\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea: \"No money? No admittance.\""

I also noticed that up until the 99.9 percentile, the graph stays kind of flat, but then it suddenly grows for both legacy and non-legacy students. The 99.9 percentile of legacy applicants have more than 6x the advantage compared to the average. Still, the 99.9 percentile of non-legacy applicants has around the same advantage or less than the poorer legacy applicants. \n\nI wonder why they value legacy students more than even the rich non-legacy students. I also wonder how different the admission process is for non-legacy, legacy, rich, and poor. \n\nIt relates to me because a lot of people think that whether you go to college or not is a very important determinant of your future. As someone who wants to go to college, seeing these kinds of statistics can be discouraging, as you know someone else will be considered first in line matter what you do, especially if you are not a legacy applicant. \n“Elite Colleges Have Preferences”"

I wonder why the students who have relatives at those colleges have better chances than the people who are going to their colleges for the first time.

They should also do scholarships or programs for lower classed students."

    "original_comment": "\"There ARE Advantages in Elite College Admissions!\"\n\nStudents whose parents' incomes are in the top 5% are far more likely to be admitted into a prestigious university.  Interestingly, students whose parents are in the 70-95th percentile get accepted less frequently.  Additionally, legacy applicants are far more likely to be admitted.  I wonder why universities care so much about the students' wealth in the admission process.  This means that students from low-income households and/or are first-generation college students are at a disadvantage.  Some universities are becoming need-blind and offering resources for first-generation college students to excel after high school."

Nearly all students at the most prestigious universities are legacy students. This affects me because I am in the college admissions process. My chances of being admitted to an Ivy League are very low because I am not a legacy at any of them. I wonder why this kind of bias is still allowed in the decision process. There have been legislations passed in the last few years that have taken race, economic, and standardized testing bias out of the process.

    "original_comment": "This graph compares students with the same test scores and how their chances of being admitted to elite colleges can fluctuate based on their legacy status and their parent's income rank. It is clear from this graph that in every income rank, legacy status helps boost admission. I find it insane that very wealthy people with legacy status are 7x more likely to get into a school than a poorer person without status who worked just as hard to get the same scores. I wonder why there is such a bias in college admissions. One reason for this bias is that wealthy families may donate a lot of money to the school which could put applicants at an advantage. However, one would assume that by having all this wealth, one already has an advantage in life. Therefore, giving a wealthy and a poor person who both have legacy status and have the same scores unequal opportunities is solidifying those societal norms. Also the poor students not getting into these elite colleges because they are put at an inherent disadvantage when applying, it is further hindering their opportunities in life. I wonder if giving out financial aid is one of the reasons that poorer students who have the same credentials as wealthy students have a less likely chance of getting into a school. I know that financial aid is limited. This affects me because I will be applying to colleges soon. Some schools are doing away with legacy status, so I am not sure how much this graph will affect me. \n\"Legacy Boost= Bias\""

    "original_comment": "In this graph, it is measuring the relation between parents’ income, legacy status, and admissions status at the collegiate level. I noticed that, generally, richer applicants had a greater estimated legacy boost than those who were poorer. For example, as the parents’ income rank became closer and closer to 100th, the estimated legacy boost became closer and closer to 7x. Whereas, on the other hand, poorer applicants closer to an income rank of 10th seemed to only have an estimated legacy boost of 2x. I wonder if the legacy boost is greater for applicants whose parents have a higher income rank because having a richer background increases the chances of multiple generations of family members being able to afford attending that college. Additionally, I noticed that the estimated advantage in admissions for those without legacy status on the richer end of the spectrum was lower than for those who were poorer and wonder why this is the case. I also wonder what criteria and processes a school uses to determine their legacy boost discrepancies and if this varies from college to college. This applies to my community because I recently went through the college process and the concept of legacy advantage has been a concern for many. It can be unfair as applicants can have very similar profiles to legacy applicants yet those with legacy are favored over them. My headline for this graph would be: “Is Bias Overcoming the College Admissions Process?”."

However, I also noticed that it is 7 times more likely that a legacy applicant to an elite college would be admitted if their parents’ income is higher than the 90th percentile. Additionally, I find it interesting that there is a dip in the graph for applicants without a legacy status in which the parents are around the 70th percentile in income. This is intriguing because parents with a relatively low income (in the “poorer” income rank) were two times as likely to be admitted. With this, I noticed and wondered why the “poorer” and “richer” extreme income rank almost reached the same likelihood of admittance for non-legacy applicants. Furthermore, I wonder how the graph would appear individually for each of the elite colleges (which elite college favors more legacies overall?). The graph relates to my community because as a senior, I along with many of my classmates are going through the college admissions process. This makes me wonder how money and legacies will affect my classmates’ admissions to certain colleges. \n\n“Are Elite Colleges Truly for Elite Students or the Elite?”"

    "original_comment": "I notice that students with legacy status and whose parents’ income rank is in the top .1% are 7 times as likely to be admitted to a given school compared to a non-legacy student who is not incredibly wealthy. I also notice that people without legacy status who are incredibly wealthy have a much greater advantage than non-legacy students who have lower incomes. I wonder why these elite colleges place so much emphasis on financial status. If these families are already wealthy why should they be given even more advantages in life than they already have? Why do these schools not attempt to give opportunities to people who may not have a lot of money but have the potential to be incredibly successful if they are given the opportunity to study at a prestigious university? It is very likely that these legacy families donate large sums of money to the universities and continue to do so as their children and their grandchildren get accepted. These donations provide the university with significant benefits and could be a very likely reason why they choose to admit legacy students who are very likely to attend and who have parents who will provide continuous donations to the university during and after their time there. If they choose not to accept a legacy student they may lose some of their best donors, and prestigious universities make incredible amounts of money from their donations and would not want to lose these funds. -unifished see other post"

I also noticed that many people with higher income ranks in the 80-85% range have a significantly lower advantage without a legacy.\n2. Why do kids with higher parental income with no legacy have a lower chance of getting in? Shouldn't the colleges want money? Do legacy applicants with less amount of money get in due to scholarships or high academic performance. What is the age gap of the applicant relatives? Do colleges asks for you parents' income when you are filling out your application?\n3. It relates to me and my community because as a junior in high school, it is interesting to see what colleges are looking for from their applicants, and if they look at your amount of money or your academic performance?\n4. \"College Applicants: You Cant be Too Rich\""

    "original_comment": "I noticed that legacy students of all income rankings tend to see significantly higher admission rates than non legacy students. To a certain extent, income also seems to be a determining factor in admission rates. Students with family incomes ranking in the top 10% are much more likely to be admitted than those in the bottom 10%. \n\nThe fact that students are more likely to be admitted when their family income is higher is interesting. Many colleges claim to be need-blind when looking at college applications, so the data has to be due to other factors possibly influenced by higher income. Students with more resources have easier access to information, tutors, or other outside assistance. These resources are likely to positively impact their academic performance and college applications. However, students with less resources end up disadvantaged in comparison to these students.\n\nThis graph sheds light on how a student’s family background — something they have no control over — can impact their lives. A student whose family has a higher income and more access to resources will typically end up more successful than one with a lower income. As a community, students with less access to resources needed for academic excellence need to be addressed. If we can address this issue, we can reduce the disparity between legacy and non-legacy, or high-income and low-income.\n\nHeadline:\nLeaving Others Behind:  Legacy and High-Income Students Secure College Spots at Unfairly High Rates"
