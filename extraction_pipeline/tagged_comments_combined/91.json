It shows a percentile of how many players and coaches are a different race than white. \nWhat do you Wonder?\nI wonder if the other races either than white are more popular to play in the athletic field.\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis has a quite of a big impact due to the fact that the white race originated the sports around the world. It shows that a lot of people from different countries can also compete as an athlete in any sports.\nWhat's going on in this graph? Write a catchy title for this graph.\nIt shows that in the professional athletic field they are  more players and coaches of color than any other race. \nThe catchy title I would give to this specific graph is Diversity In The Professional Athletic Field."

    "original_comment": "“The Never Ending Game Against Racism, but is the Game Even Fair?” \n\nI noticed that there is a higher percentage of players of color than head coaches of color. This speaks volumes in that it is less so lack of opportunity but lack of ability for POC to move up in the industries that our society lives off of. The fact of the matter is that there is so much more that goes into the earnings of leadership roles, like coaching as opposed to roles such as players, that stretches beyond talent and ability and starts to fall into the unwarranted areas of politics and duplicity.  \n\nI wonder why the number of colored players almost always outnumbers the colored coaches by 3 times. I wonder why this is even an occurring issue. How could we eliminate the obstacles present in the sports industry that people of color face that enable them from achieving the same positions as caucasians?\n\nThe impact this issue has on my community is ever so present and relevant, and has been for the last 400 years. Although I live in a predominately white community, this issue is still present. If this is occurring on such page platforms such as the professional sport industry, it is indubitably present in smaller proportions.\n\nThe graph clearly displays the discrepancy between the percentage of lead coaches of color and the percentage of players who are of color in the major league sports industry. It clearly shows that the amount of colored players is much higher than the amount of coaches of color."

The NFL only has 13% of coaches of color. On the other hand, the WBNA and NBA have 83% of coaches as people of color. Although the MLB only has a 20% gap between coaches of color and players of color, they only have 20% of coaches as minorities and 40% of players as minorities. The percent of colored players is the least out of all the leagues. I also noticed that the data for the WBNA was taken from 2019 whereas the rest of was taken in 2020. \n\nI wonder how these percentages compare to say a decade ago. Did the percent difference between coaches of color and players of color grow or shrink? I also wonder how they would compare a decade into the future. Would the numbers drastically change or stay relatively the same? I'm also curious how diversity graphs would look internationally (i.e. European and Asian sports). Is this graph indicative of how people of color are treated in professional sports? \n\nThis impacts my community because while diversity has grown very much in sports, discrimination still takes place. While I think discrimination has lessened for players, I think it still poses challenges and obstacles for staff and personnel of color. Even though the US has made progress, there's still a long way to go. \n\nA headline could be, \"Diversity in Professional Sports: Staff vs. Players\"."

I also notice that there are more head coaches of color in the Major League of Soccer despite having the lowest percentage of players of color. I wonder as to why it is that we see these trends among race with specific sports. I wonder if it is a cultural aspect that makes it so that more people of color are inclined to play basketball and football over soccer because there are way less people of color who actually play soccer. I wonder if they feel unwelcomed or whether it is a predominantly white sport. The impact that this has on my community is that it helps me understand a lot more as to why I see this trend. Coming from a predominantly person of color community, I do understand that a lot more people are interested in football and basketball because it is a sport that many of us were exposed to growing up from a young age.

It’s interesting that the leagues with the smallest gaps (MLB & MLS) have fewer players of color also.\n\nI wonder how these percentages compare to those from previous years. What are these initiatives referenced? Have the leagues shown progress? How are the players within these leagues affected by these gaps and are their concerns being addressed?\n\nAs a high school teacher, I think of how data like this affects my students. While those within the POC community could be encouraged by the percentage of players of color within the leagues, what difficult thoughts/questions come when they see the lack of representation in the leadership percentages. When seeing this data, would my students be motivated to dig deeper, asking themselves “Are others concerned about this?” or “What is being done about it?” My hope is that, despite their initial reaction, they would find their voice to ask the questions troubling them and their power to research and advocate further!\n\nDespite progress or initiatives that have been implemented to address the discrepancies seen above, more work needs to be done.

What impact does this have on you and your community?\nI certainly didn’t know about the lack of diversity in head coaches of color in sports leagues.

This is most apparent in the NFL, where 74% of players are POC while only 13% of coaches are—a difference of 61%. The gap is apparent in all five sports shown, which indicates that the phenomenon is not likely to be due to random chance. \nI wonder why the gap in percentages varies across different types of sports. For example, there is only a 20% gap in baseball compared to the 61% gap in football. I also wonder why there is such a large discrepancy between the percentage of players and head coaches of color in the first place. \nThis graph makes me reflect on how we seem to be reluctant to have people of color in leadership positions, and how we can do better in the future. In my community, I am reminded that it is essential to uplift and empower people of color to give them equal leadership opportunities. \nThis graph shows a clear pattern: the percentage of lead coaches of color is significantly lower than players of color across major sports. A headline could be “Diversity in Team Leadership: Are We Truly Equal?”"

I am curious about this because I wonder if the numbers would change, especially in the MLS since it is more popular in Europe and South America than in the United States. Does this also lead to the fact that since soccer is not among the top three most popular sports in the U.S. and the understanding that many players are not from America, is the reason why the numbers are more equal among people of color and non-color in both players and coaches?  \n \nI also wonder why the data for the WNBA is from 2019 and not 2020 like the rest of the data.

    "original_comment": "Part 2\nI wonder what the term “colored” is referring to. Does this refer to everyone who is non-caucasian or does this refer to only African Americans? I am curious about this because I wonder if the numbers would change, especially in the MLS since it is more popular in Europe and South America than in the United States. This also leads to the fact that since soccer is not among the top three most popular sports in the U.S. and the understanding that many players are not from America, is the reason why the numbers are more equal among people of color and non-color in both players and coaches? I also wonder why the data for the WNBA is from 2019 and not 2020 like the rest of the data. Is this not as accurate because of the Coronavirus?\n \nI am not oblivious to the fact that people of color are likely more athletic than those who are white. However, I do not think racism has played a factor in allowing someone of color to play. It is obvious to see this in the charts given that over half of the players are of color; except for the MLB.  I do, however, believe it plays a part in the coaching and managing staff. The impact this has on my community is to spread awareness of the lack of diversity clearly stated in the graphs displayed. There have been major changes within the past decades of player equality, but many sports organizations have been lacking the effort needed of adding more diversity in many of these leadership roles."

In all the leagues, the amount of colored players was at significantly more than the amount of colored headcoaches. \n\nI wonder why the percentage of colored players is much higher than the percentage of colored head coaches. I also wonder why the percentage of colored players in the MLB is quite lower than the rest of the leagues. Is baseball a sport that colored people don't play as much? Why are colored people not able to get as many spots as a head coach versus as a player?\n\nIt impacts my community positively, because it inspires me that there are so many colored people that are able to play sports proffesionaly. However, it also impacts me and my community negatively, because the graph also tells us that not many colored people are allowed to be a head coach. \n\nMy title is: \"Colored people are mostly the majority in players, but why not as head coaches?"

Although they did put the head coaches of color, why didn't they add the assistant coaches. I feel adding the assistant coaches would've added a more exponential difference. I wonder why the managers were shown in Major League Baseball instead of the head coaches. I have read other responses to this same question and have figured that the head coach on a Major League Baseball team is ultimately called managers. I also wonder why there aren't very many colored coaches in the National Football League. To conclude, I think major sports leagues are becoming more diverse which can impact our lives majorly."

    "original_comment": "Part 1\n\nWhat do you notice? I immediately noticed the same percentage of people of color that are in the NBA and WNBA. However, the NBA has a greater percentage of colored head coaches than the WNBA by five percent. I believe the number of coaches of color and coaches who are women collaborates; the fact is that both of their numbers are extremely low compared to those of white males. The reasoning for this? I am not sure. Possibly because men who are white are more likely to get the job because of their appearance, even if the other colored coaches are a better fit for the job. My greatest assumption of why white coaches are more common in these major league sports than those of color is because these issues of racial inequality have not been addressed as profoundly as they have been this past year, especially with the Black Lives Matter Movement. Many of these coaches have been doing their jobs for what could be the last decade. I do think it would be unfair for a perfectly capable coach to be fired if he or she is white because the team thought they needed more diversity within their coaching staff. I do not think race should be involved in the decision of hiring coaches; whoever best fits deserves the position."

The impact that this could have on people in my community is devastating. I myself have watched sports my whole life and I used to dream of being a basketball coach in the WNBA. I never thought that I couldn't reach my goal because I always saw people who looked just like me doing it. Now I have come to realize that my fellow teammates, classmates, and friends had doubts as children because they never saw people who looked like them doing what they dreamed of, so they thought that they weren't allowed or that they didn't want people who looked like them to be in those positions. I can only imagine what it would feel like to have a dream but believe you couldn't reach it because of the skin color that you were born with. I think that these sats are a prime example of the argument that there should be more representation and equality in sports and positions of high regard."

    "original_comment": "What do I notice? I notice that there are many more white coaches than black coaches. There is a problem with these graphs though. I can see they're trying to say that racism is still around, but this is actually pretty proportional to America. About 70% of America is made of people not of color. There's obviously going to be more non-people of color. It's silly to not think so.\n\nI wonder why the NHL was excluded from this. The NHL has very few black players at the moment, around 43, since 2020. A typical NHL roster consists of 20 players, which is about 620 players. And only 43 of them are black. There are currently NO black head coaches in the NHL. You can argue racism on this, which is partially true,\n\nRecently there have been more and more NHL coaches being fired from their position due to racist accusations, and them turning out to be true. I'd like to see the NHL in here, so people could question, why does the NHL have so few POC players?"

The darker pink bars represent the players of color, and the lighter pink bars represent the head coaches of color. I also notice that in the graph they included the women's basketball association and the national basketball association. With these two graphs compared right next to each other, I notice that the women's basketball association has 5% fewer head coaches of color than the national basketball association. I  wonder why that is? I wonder why the national football league has the fewest amount of head coaches of color? I also wonder why the head coaches of the color statistic are less than 50% for all of the sports?

This plays a big impact on our community because it shows how much our country has changed. It's weird to think that years ago people of color were separated from just using the same bathroom as white people. And now there is a big mix of different ethnicities on our national sports teams. One of the greatest baseball players, Hank Aaron, was not allowed to play with a white team until 1953. He still faced discrimination after that. This shows how much our country has grown and changed. I also wonder how hard it is to get on one of the competitive teams with your race. Many sports teams want to create diversity, so they want different races on their team. This also reminds me of colleges, many colleges look to enroll people of a different race than what the average is at that certain college."

I also notice that basketball has the highest percentage of players of color (83% for men and women) and soccer has the highest percentage coaches of color (41%).\n\nWonder: I wonder why basketball, both women's and men's, has the highest percentage of players of color compared to the other sports. Is it because of the basketball influence for people of color, or other reasons? I also wonder why football has such a low percentage of coaches of color at 13% despite having the second largest percentage of players of color, at 74%.\n\nImpact: These numbers impact me and my community in a largely positive way because it shows that many sports players are very diverse in major sports. However, it could also be concerning, because the coaching positions are not as diverse. In fact, not a single sport listed has over 50% coaches of color.\n\nCatchy Headline: Shocking Statistics Reveal Major Discrepancies in Diversity between Playing and Coaching Positions."

    "original_comment": "As I look at this graph, I notice that in every major league sport, the percentage of players of color is higher than the percentage of head coaches of color. I can’t help but wonder if this is because of the smaller sample size of the head coaches.\n\nIn the MLB’s case, there are only 30 managers total, one for each team. Each team has, at most, a 40-player expanded roster. With 30 teams in the league, there can be a maximum of 1,200 players that play for the MLB at once. The difference between the minuscule amount of managers and the much larger number of players makes me wonder how much the sample size comes into play. If each team had a 1:1 manager/player ratio, would the percentage of head coaches of color still only be 20 percent?\n\nThe issue of the small sample size also is relevant in each one of the other sports. The NFL has the highest number of head coaches, at 32. The NFL has more than 1,500 active players every year, which gives a much higher opportunity for diversity than the mere 32 coaches. When it comes down to it, I think the reason the percentages of diversity are much lower in coaches is because of availability. The average NFL player’s career only lasts 3.3 seasons, whereas the average NFL head coach’s career is nearly a full year longer, averaging out at 4.3 seasons. To me, the long career, as well as the limited availability, are very large factors in whether or not a position is diverse or not, because the positions are not being filled as quickly."

Many of the sports have at least two times the percent of players of color then coaches of color, the one exception being the M.L.S. One other thing I noticed is that there are far less colored players in the M.L.B. \n\nWhat I wonder: I wonder why companies or sports corporations have not been giving out more jobs to colored people in the coaching position. With many of the players in sports now being colored I think a colored coach may end up being able to work with them better. I also wonder why there is such a lack of diversity in the M.L.B. Something just seems off when you look at all the other sports diversity compared to the M.L.B’s. \n\nImpact: This statistics show the truth about professional careers in sports being both a player and a coach. It makes me think that it must be a lot harder to be good at basketball if you are white then if you are colored. Seeing these statistics may call others to try and do something about the lack of diversity in coaching or leadership roles. I thought many sports organizations have said that they try to add diversity but this shows that they are not doing so in any leadership roles.\n\nTitle:  Lack of diversity for leadership roles.

Are they reserving more spots in the leagues for people of colour or simply supporting them more, allowing them to increase their skills and make it onto the teams?\n\n3.

That surprises me because a lot of people of color play football.\n\nI wonder how in the future if these stats will go up or down for people with color, and I also wonder if it will only be certain ones that go up or down. it looks like these numbers have gone up for colored people so I expect them to keep going up for them still.\n\nI think this impacts me and my community because it goes to show that we are all equal and want to end racism. Also it shows us that this world isn't so bad after all.\n\nwhat going ronin this graph is that people of color are starting to have more and more rule over sports and they are starting to have more and more people in there doing the things that they love and proving they can."

The Women's national Basketball Association and the National Basketball Association has the 83% of players of color which is the highest out of all shows teams. The lowest percentage of POC as coaches is 13% in the NFL.\n2. What do you wonder?\nI wonder why there is such a low percentage of Head coaches of color?\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis impacts me and my community because racism is clearly still a part of the major sports leagues. POC won't get the same opportunities as white people in regards to being head coach of teams  in the major sports leagues.\n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\nThe graphs is showing data regarding percentages of Player of color in Major sports leagues and Head coaches of color. A catchy headline would be \"Lack of Diversity in Sports\""

This made us wonder why this gap in player and coaching representation exists. We also noticed that soccer and baseball have the lowest percentage of colored players. On the other side of it, Major League Soccer has the highest percentage of head coaches of color. Another thing we noticed was that all of the data is from 2020 except for one group, the Women’s National Basketball Association which is from 2019. This makes you curious as to why they would include data from a different year only for one of the groups. This also made us wonder why they would only show one women's sport out of the 5 sports showcased. Lastly, we noticed that for the MLB, managers were counted as head coaches instead of the actual coaches being counted. This made us wonder why they would have to count managers and not head coaches like they did for every other sport. From our observations and wonderings, we thought of the data’s impact on our community. For one, it makes it clear that to our community that there is a major problem with underrepresented coaches of color in professional sports. From that it makes us question what we as a community can do to lessen this issue."

That major league soccer has the most head coaches of color and that national football league has the least. I also noticed that the women's national basketball association has the most players of color while the major league baseball has the least.\n\nI wonder why the number of colored players almost always outnumbers the colored coaches by 3 times. I wonder why soccer players have so many more coaches of color compared to every single other sport. I wonder why the NFL a sports league with a very high percentage of colored players has the lowest percentage of colored coaches, especially compared to the MLB with such a low percentage of colored players but a high percentage of colored coaches. \n\nWhen I look at these statistics, It makes me wonder if people of color are getting the same opportunities in the community when it comes to different roles in sports. It looks like they get great opportunities to play the sports but not as many opportunities to be managers or coaches in the sports. We should be looking at giving people of color more opportunities to be in management positions at a younger age, so that when they grow up we will have more of them managing sports teams professionally."

    "original_comment": "Summary:\n \nIt is a graph showing the percentage of players and coaches with color in some sports. Based on the sports and the names of the sports associations, we can assume that these are sports associations that are based in the United States.  We’ve noticed that most of the sports have a vast majority of colored players, while most of the coaches are white. Colored athletes in basketball are well represented compared to other sports. However, coaching has a much lower percentage of minorities. We wonder why the head coaches are less likely to be people of color because for each sport the percentage of color for coaches is lower than players? We also wonder why soccer has such a high percentage of coaches of color compared to the other sports, could it be because it is more widely played in other parts of the world so there’s a wider variety of coaches? This data may impact our community because it is discouraging coaches of color to pursue a coaching position on more diverse teams. However, this could influence minorities or people of color to join sports, where everybody is included. You can become a professional player of any sport no matter your skin color. \n \nOur catchy headline for this graph is “The divide in diversity: the gap between diverse athletes and coaches”"

    "original_comment": "Based on the data provided in the graph, we found that despite a majority of sports having large percentages of players of color, there are far less coaches of color to represent them. As an example, the National Football League consists of 74% players of color, however, has only 13% coaches of color serving in the league. We also noticed that Major League Baseball tends to have the fewest players of color in comparison to other sports featured in the graph. These findings led us to question, why do the percentages of players of color seemingly have little correlation to the amount of coaches of color? Furthermore, the information presented in the graph affects both ourselves and our community in several ways. Underrepresentation in sports can have a major effect on young people of color who hope to pursue a career in professional sports and potentially hurt their aspirations. Our group also believed it was important for players and coaches to be able to have people around them who are different and have experienced different things in order for them to grow and be able to create relationships. Our headline for this article would be : “Major league sports in relation to coaches and players of color.\""

As a group, we noticed that people of color make up a very high percentage of these sports teams, despite making up a very small amount of the coaches and managers. Our group is curious about a few things in this graph. For one; which group makes up the gray portion of each bar? We also want to know why there is a noticeable lack of players of color within the MLB. The data collection process also makes us wonder, what specific teams were involved, who gathered the data? Though arguably most importantly, we wonder about the paycheck difference between coaches and players. We want to know what are some consequences of having so few people of color acting as coaches."

    "original_comment": "We notice that the national basketball associations have the highest percentages of players of color of all the sports. After the basketball associations, the national football league has the second highest percentage of players of color. I also notice that the head coaches of color don't even come close to the percentage of players of color. Soccer has the highest percentage of coaches of color which makes sense since it is a more worldly sport. The more “American” sports tend to have lower diversity in coaching staff. These sports would be football and baseball. We wonder why there are less coaches of color overall compared to players of color. Is it because there are simply more players of color or is it due to discrimination amongst coaches in those specific sports/leagues. Also, what could be the criteria/standards for being a coach? Maybe there’s a specific reason why there are more players of color rather than pursuing a head coach career. This graph impacts our community by highlighting the lack of coaches and even people of color in leadership positions throughout school sports. This puts emphasis on the issue of racial inequality in the sports system. We think that if there were more coaches of color there would be more kids of color that would feel comfortable participating in these activities and that kids of color would also get more opportunities in the sport they chose to participate in. \nCatchy Headline: The lack of diversity in sports leadership"

Especially in football where 74% of the NFL is made up of player of color and only 13% of the NFL head coaches are people of color.\n\nI wonder what percent of the staff on these major sports leagues such as assistant managers, coaches, nutritionist, etc. are people of color?\n\nThis impacts my community because for awhile now we've seen people of color excel at sports. However, it is just as important people of color have the opportunity to be coaching staff and be involved in more ways than just being players. If teams utilize people of color to play for their teams and win games, they should have just as much respect for people of color when it comes to hiring coaching staff.\n\nDiversity in major sports leagues off the field."

This data could have been used since the percentage of player of color (83%) matched the NBA percentage of 2020. I also notice how the MLB's players of color (40%) equal less than half of the NBA or WNBA (83%). \n\nI wonder why the data of the WNBA was not available for the 2020 season. I also wonder why overall there are much less head coaches of color per team than players of color. Could this be because there are just more players, or are head coaches discriminated against in these leagues.\n\nThis data may impact my community by discouraging people of color in pursuing a coaching career due to its lack of diversity. On the other hand, this data may encourage people of color to continue working at their sport (besides MLB which is 40% players of color) in order to make a career.\n\nDiversity in Professional Teams"

The MLS is the closest in percentage between Players of color and Head Coach of Color and the WNBA and the NBA have an equal percent of players of color; there is 5% more Head Coach of Color in the NBA than the WNBA.\n\n2. I wonder why are only managers shown for the MLB? How players are recruited into the WNBA and NBA? What is the criteria for being a head coach? Why are there less Head coaches of color than players? Finally, I wonder why MLB and MLS contain fewer players of color?\n\n3.  Some possible impacts in my community is that the job market for head coaches of color is limited. Furthermore, in my community, Students are interested in being football players which means that there are more students of color with the ability to make their dreams come true. \n \n4. Sports: Diversity or Lies or  Head Coaches of Color? The Color spectrum in Sports"

In baseball, most of the players don't identify as colored. \n\nWonder: I wonder why there aren't many people of color in higher levels of the sports industry. Maybe the non-colored coaches are more qualified? It could also be that they still don't hire people of color to hold high positions. \n\nImpact: This graph shows our generation that people of color are able to play sports with others that look like them, without being uncomfortable. But, the issue here is that we also don't see coaches of color- this is sending the message that people of color are not fit to be in higher positions. \n\nHeadline: Is it truly diverse?

I wonder why sports leagues have decided until recent years that they want to diversify team leadership? This impacts me and my community because as a person of color myself who lives in a city with most of the population as minorities you truly get to see how far we've gotten into allowing people of color into sports leagues. Though this doesn't mean we've accomplished increasing diversity it does allow young colored children the ability to hope and see themselves as a professional athlete. In this graph were able to see the percentages of players and dead coaches of color in some of the biggest major sports leagues. A headline for the graphs may be, \"How people of colored have diversified major sports leagues.\""

Everyone is the same no matter what. It doesn’t really impact our community because everyone is just judged on how they act and how they treat others as a person.

This could be because they are coincidentally not qualified enough or just because of racism. \n\nThis graph tells me that people of color from my generation can play sports without feeling left out or underrepresented. The issue here is that the coaches' data is not showing as much diversity as the player data. This could be discouraging to individuals of color- showing that it's not possible for them to accomplish more than just playing the sport. \n\nMy headline for this graph would be \"Is Diversity Balanced Between Coaches and Players?\""

What impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis shows me that coaching staffs are often not as diverse as the teams themselves.

Why is it that Caucasians are mostly coaching - why isn’t there diversity in the spectrum of sports? Is money and maybe racial bias to be honest the reason this is so? (Are African Americans gifted with sports, or are they Bid upon or played like puppets behind the scenes by the people that run everything which just so happen to be whites in power, in the sport industry.)\n\nThe impact goes heavily upon African Americans. Yes, if you aspire to iconic in sports or whatever then execute the process of achieving that dream! I just want you to know the real game, again behind the scenes, and if these racial statistics help prove my stance in that. This does not so much affect anyone else really - unless they are obsessed with sports, or believes that everything needs to generally be diverse."

It doesn't really impact me but it does affect me community because this just go to show how race is still a factor of today's society.

Another observation I made was that a much smaller percentage (maximum of 41%) of head coaches are people of color. \n- I wonder why there are so few colored head coaches despite there being a diverse league of players. I also question why the graph specified \"Women\" in the National Basketball Association, but not for the other leagues.\n- This impacts our community because the major sports leagues fail to have a diverse set of head coaches. The data indicates that people of color have a disadvantage in becoming a head coach compared to non-colored people. \n- A catchy headline for this graph would be \"Racial Diversity in Sports: What are the Percentages of Players and Coaches of Color in Major Sports Leagues?\""

I don’t think it impacts our community except for the people who think differently and have there opinions for people of color. So I don’t think it makes a big impact at all on my life or anyone’s."

I wonder if that makes it harder for for the players knowing that their coaches can´t relate to one of their biggest life challenges outside of the sport they play. This makes me question of the impact it might have on future coaches that are POC they must find this discourging knowing that although the athletes they will be coaching are like them their peers are not, leading them to have to face the challenges of being a pioneer in their profession. The diversty of the athletes in the sports should be the same or close to the same amount as those leading the athletes."

The head coaches of color percentages for all the sports range between 13%-41%, not even reaching 50%. To add, baseball is the only sport where colored players aren’t the majority. \n\nWhat I wonder: I wonder why the colored baseball players aren’t the majority when colored players in football, basketball, and soccer are the majority. What may have caused this? could it be because of how the sport is presented to the public?\n\nImpact on me and my community: Our community is impacted both positively and negatively by this graph. It impacts us positively because the diversity among the players can encourage other sports fans to play and shows that in some sports, colored people have the opportunity to be treated equally. It also impacts us negatively because the lack of diversity among the head coaches shows us how people of color might not have the opportunity to lead and could possibly reinforce the stereotypical job types present in society.\n\nMy title:  “Colored individuals aren’t getting equal opportunities on both sides of the major sports leagues, study says.”"

For example, the number of players of color in both national basketball associations are over 50% greater than the number in Major League Baseball.\n\n3. I think that more representation for people of color in sports will allow more people of color to be comfortable with and motivated to play sports professionally.\n\n4. This graph shows the amount of diversity in major sports leagues. A catchy headline would be \"Diversity in Sports\"."

The head coaches of color percentages for all the sports range between 13%-41%, not even reaching 50%. To add, baseball is the only sport where colored players aren’t the majority. \n\nWhat I wonder: I wonder why the colored baseball players aren’t the majority when colored players in football, basketball, and soccer are the majority. What may have caused this? could it be because of how the sport is presented to the public?\n\nImpact on me and my community: Our community is impacted both positively and negatively by this graph. It impacts us positively because the diversity among the players can encourage other sports fans to play and shows that in some sports, colored people have the opportunity to be treated equally. It also impacts us negatively because the lack of diversity among the head coaches shows us how people of color might not have the opportunity to lead and could possibly reinforce the stereotypical job types present in society.\n\nMy title:  “Colored individuals aren’t getting equal opportunities on both sides of the major sports leagues, study says.”"

Most players of the sports listed are above 50%. Excluding MLB which is 40%.\n\nWhat do you wonder? I wonder why the percentage of players of color is so high but the percentage of coaches are significantly lower. Why does this disparity occur? Another interesting occurrence is that in all sports but MLS, the percentage of colored players is twice the amount of the percentage of colored coaches. Why does MLS stick out in that respect?\n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?  This affects those of color who aspire to be coaches of these major sports leagues. A possible explanation is racial prejudice. As coaches are in a state of greater power and responsibility over a team, which represents their community. This, unfortunately, gives those of color an extremely hard journey to become a coach compared to other races.  This should not be the case and this graph clearly points this fact out. This is a probable reason for the disparity of race.\n\nWhat’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea. The graph shows the disparity for players of color compared to head coaches of color. \nHeadline: Racial disparity in sports, diversity for players, the opposite for coaches, why is this the case?"

    "original_comment": "I noticed that the majority of players in all sports, except for major league baseball, are players of color. Basketball in particular is dominated by people of color with an approximate 4:1 ratio for both genders, while baseball is almost equal but leaning towards white people with a 3:2 ratio. \nIn every poll, it is clear that the percentage of head coaches of color are significantly lower than the percentage of players of color. In National League Football, most of the players are of color (74%), whilst head coaches of color are only 13%. I wonder why is there such a noticeable difference between players of color and coaches of color? In the sports Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer, the percentage of head coaches of color are 20% lower than players of color. This is a smaller difference compared to the 60% difference in National League Football. As for Women's and Men's National Basketball Association, the percentage difference between coaches of color and players of color is around 50%. \nAlthough some differences are more noticeable than others, we can clearly see that people of color are less likely to be head coach in a major sports league. This has an impact on the community around us because it shows people of color have different opportunities to be in power than white people.\nAn interesting headline would be, \"Player of Colors vs. Head Coaches of Color in different major sports leagues\"."

I also noticed that soccer had the most coaches of color as well.  Both women's and men's basketball have the same number of players of color.  Finally, I noticed that football had the least coaches of color with the third highest players of color\n\n2. Some things I wonder is why basketball has the most players of color and why baseball has the least amount of players of color.  Another thing I wonder is why football has the least amount of coaches of color and why soccer has the most coaches of color.\n\n3. The impact this has on me isn't that great.  Although I play basketball and is a man of color, it still doesn't affect me in any way just because of my skin color.  \n\n4. What's going on in the graph is that it's showing the percentage of people of color who play professional sports.  A catchy title or headline for this graph would be, \"Percentages of colored people in professional sports\""

In every poll, it is obvious that most of the head coaches in each league are non-colored. I notice that basketball (men's and women's) has the highest percentage of colored players. \n\nWonder: I wonder why there are so many non-colored coaches in the leagues. Are non-colored coaches better at coaching overall? Is it just because of the history of coaches? Why does major league soccer have the highest percentage of colored coaches? I also wonder why basketball has the highest percentage of colored players.\n\nImpact: This impacts the community of sports. These statistics show that there is a less percentage of people of color in higher positions such as coaches. We need more representation in these jobs of higher power and control.\n\nWhat is going on in this graph?\nThey are comparing the percentages of people of color for players and head coaches in different sports leagues. \n\nCatchy Title: We have diversity on the field, but what about behind the scenes on the sideline?"

In addition, there are approximately 3 players of color for every coach of color for both the Women's National Basketball Association and the National Basketball Association. \n\nI wonder what causes there to be a disproportionately few amount of coaches of color compared to players of color. In addition, I wonder what each of these sports leagues is currently doing to try to combat these disparities. \n\nThis has an impact on my community because it reflects how people of color have disproportionately few opportunities to be in leadership positions or positions of power.\n\nA catchy headline I would use to describe this graph would be: Disproportionately Few Head Coaching Opportunities for People of Color in Major Sports Leagues"

    "original_comment": "I noticed that the majority of players in all sports, except for major league baseball, are players of color. Basketball in particular is dominated by people of color with an approximate 4:1 ratio for both genders, while baseball is almost equal but leaning towards white people with a 3:2 ratio. \nIn every poll, it is clear that the percentage of head coaches of color are significantly lower than the percentage of players of color. In National League Football, most of the players are of color (74%), whilst head coaches of color are only 13%. I wonder why is there such a noticeable difference between players of color and coaches of color? In the sports Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer, the percentage of head coaches of color are 20% lower than players of color. This is a smaller difference compared to the 60% difference in National League Football. As for Women's and Men's National Basketball Association, the percentage difference between coaches of color and players of color is around 50%. \nAlthough some differences are more noticeable than others, we can clearly see that people of color are less likely to be head coach in a major sports league. This has an impact on the community around us because it shows people of color have different opportunities to be in power than white people.\nAn interesting headline would be, \"Player of Colors vs. Head Coaches of Color in different major sports leagues\"."

    "original_comment": "I noticed that both of the Basketball Associations have high percentages which means that people of color would have a better chance playing or coaching basketball. The NFL has also done a pretty good job at keeping their players diverse, however not as much for their coaches. The MLS has done a pretty decent job at keeping their players diverse at 60% as well as having the highest percentage for head coaches of color at 40%. On the other hand, the MLB has less than 50% of their players of color so they haven't done as well of a job at keeping their players diverse. I wonder why the MLS has a lower percentage than the NFL, WNBA, and the NBA for their players, yet have a higher percentage for the coaches. It's odd that their players/coaches ratio of color is somewhat proportionate but then the MLS has a different ratio than the rest. This doesn't really have an impact on me unless I wanted to play professionally in the WNBA, however I'm more interested in soccer (NWSL) which is the women's version of MLS who's data isn't in this data set. On the other hand, this probably impacts the community in a way that they would be more concerned for the MLB seeing that their percentages are lower than 50%. In the graph, the data shows the diversity of players and coaches within different sports leagues. As for the title/main idea of the data, I would name it \"Modern Professional Sports Leagues Diversities\"."

Additionally, majority of the head coaches are not people of colors. The NFL has the least number of colored head coachers, at 13%, while the MLS has the largest number of colored head coaches, at 41%. I wonder why in some sports, there are so many players of color, and less coaches of color. Since I am a person of color, this has an impact on me, as it proves to me that there is diversity in sports, and that race isn't a deciding factor when joining a sports team. This graph shows the percentage of colored sports players and the percentage of colored head coaches on sports teams.

The National Football League are also doing well in diversifying players, and the same for the National Basketball Association. However, the Major League Baseball is lacking a little more than the others in people of color, the percentage being less than 50. Major League Soccer is also slightly less than the others, but it stays above 50 as well. The Major League Soccer also has the highest percentage of head coaches who are people of color.\nI wonder why the Major League Baseball doesn't have as much as the others. I thought every sport would have at least 50% people of color. It seems that it needs a little more diversification, because it is lacking in people of color compared to the other leagues and associations.\nThis doesn't have much impact on me, but it probably has a slight impact on my community. I'm glad that there's a lot more diversification in sports. I'm South Asian so if anyone from there is interested in any of these sports, I know race wouldn't stop them. I'm glad there's a more positive impact on sports.\nThe graph shows the percentage of players of color and head coaches of color in different sports leagues and associations. The graph's main idea would be \"The Diversification in Different Sports Leagues and Associations\". That's what I would make the title and what captures the main idea of the graph."

The impact this has on me is that I am of color and it shows the different statistics and opportunities for people of color, like me. This impacts the community by displaying the diversity among members of sports leagues. In this graph, a common trend is that in all of the listed sports leagues, the ratio of players of color to coaches of color is, on average, around 4:1.

I also wonder what these graphs have looked like in previous years, how much have they changed throughout the years?\nOur community is predominantly white and seeing this data impacts us by giving us a better understanding of the diversity of sports across the US. It also implies that people of color are not represented enough in the coaching community and may not be given as many opportunities."

The average percentage of players of color in these sports is 68% whereas the percentage of people of color who are coaches is 25.8%.\n\nI wonder why major league baseball is the only sport where the majority of players are Caucasian.\n\nI’m not sure how this impacts me personally since I don’t watch or play any sports. My community is mostly Caucasian so I feel that it doesn’t impact them much either.\n\nMy headline would be: “Diversity of Major Sports”"

What do you notice?\nBased on the graphs displayed,I notice that there are far more players of color than head coaches of color in all the sports represented by graphs here. I also notice that both mens and women's basketball have an 83% rate of racial disparity which are the top sports with players of color. I also notice that major league soccer has a 41% head coach of color which is the highest of the represented sports. The National Football League has a 13% head coach of color rate. \n \n2. What do you wonder?\nI wonder what these graphs would have looked like in previous years to be able to compare then and now. I wonder how they choose which sports to graph. \n \n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nWe live in a predominantly white community with a majority of New Hampshire being white. Because of this we don’t see racism first hand but we are very much aware of it. \n\n4. What’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.\n\"Racism on the Fields\""

I wonder what causes leagues that have many players of color to have few coaches of color. The impact this has on me is that I am of color and it shows the different statistics and opportunities for people of color, like me. This impacts the community by displaying the diversity among members of sports leagues. In this graph, a common trend is that in all of the listed sports leagues, the ratio of players of color to coaches of color is, on average, around 4:1. The graph is trying to indicate the differences in race and diversity among modern sports leagues."

As well as why there is such a low proportion of Head Coaches of Color.\nIt is important to my community of People of Color because the lack of representation of People of Color would make Children of Color hesitant to be a professional athlete or feel that they could not be an athlete and instead choose a different profession and instead work towards a different profession.\nThe graph is describing the proportion of Players of Color and Head Coaches of Color in various major sports leagues. A catchy headline for this set of graphs is “Lack of Diversity in Major Sports Leagues”."

Along with this, the athletes of color seem to be well represented, in some circumstances even being the majority, however, in all of the leagues there seems to be an inequality for white coaches compared to coaches of color.\n\nI wonder how these graphs have shifted over time since the beginning of integration in sports. Obviously, at one point there was a time that people of color weren’t even allowed in the American leagues. I wonder if once the ban was lifted, the levels of diversity in athletes slowly increased or if there was a certain point where they skyrocketed.\n \nThis does not affect me directly, however it affects the people around me and in my community as it shows the representation of people of color in sports across America. It shows that athletes are extremely diverse, and in some cases, the majority of athletes are people of color, however, regarding coaches, there is not as much of a representation. This shows some employment opportunities could still have segregation involved, and there’s room to improve going forward.\n\nThis graph depicts the level of diversity in both athletes and coaches across 5 sports leagues of America.\n \nCatchy Headline: The Diversity and Disparity of American Sports"

The percentage of players of color in major sports leagues is very high. 83% of the Women's National Basketball Association's and National Basketball Association's players are people of color while 74% of players in the National Football League are people of color. This is significantly high compare to other career fields. The Head coaches percentage, however, is totally different. The majority of percentage of head coaches of color range from 13% to 30%, very low considering how people of color are everyone who is not white. The percentage of Major League Soccer is both surprising and reasonable for me. The percentage is definitely more balance when it comes to players and head coaches. This probably can be explained by the large number of countries playing soccer in the world\n\nWhat do you wonder? Why the percentage of head coaches of color is significantly less than players of color.\n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community? Looking at the percentage of head coaches who are people of color, I can see how much work needed to be done. There should be more opportunities being provided to the people of color to coach and to lead in major sports leagues\n\nHeadline: Percentage of people of color in major sports leagues - A huge milestone or still no improvement?"

However, I also noticed that in the managerial spots for each league, there was not a single league with more than 50% coaches/managers of color.\nI wonder why teams and leagues are not focusing on racial diversity at the coaching positions? (However, I feel that in the coach’s role one shouldn’t argue someone’s skin color rather how their team does with he/her as a coach.)\nI wonder why it varies so drastically per league with people of color in the managerial roles?\nI wonder if the diversity of people of color in the managerial role has anything to do with the sport? \nThis unfortunately has little impact on my community because very few of my family friends and friends in general focus on sports and more specifically the color of the coaches/players’ skin. I feel that there needs to be more awareness in smaller towns etc. However, it is hard because we all live in a predominately white state so there is never really forced racism or on the other hand diversity on sports teams. When I do watch sports I am not focusing on who is white vs who is a player of color I am simply focusing on if my team is winning or losing. \nNew Headline - “Racial inequality is at the top of many of our sports organizations.”"

A potential issue with this could be that coaches often maintain their jobs for a very long time when compared to the players. \nI wonder why this study excluded important sports leagues such as the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League. While the NBA has a very high percentage of diversity amongst the players in their league, it also wields a very low diversity percentage for their coaches. Then, when considering the NHL, there are only 43 professional players in the entire league that are of color. Out of upwards of 620 players, it truly shows how undiverse a sport like that is. So a sport like that would be a good equalized contradiction to the graphs being shown.\nThis has a large impact on me and my community because I come from a city with very little diversity. Growing playing sports, most of my teams have always been predominantly white and the same for our coaches. Meaning that because of the lack of diversity within our community, also reflects itself upon the sports we play.\nThe graphs in this article depict the gap between the diversity of the players of sports and the diversity of the coaches of the sports in large national sports.

The only sport listed which has majority white players is Major League Baseball. The rest of the sports listed have majority POC players. Every sport listed has a fairly low number of POC coaches. The majority of coaches seem to be white. I wonder if racism embedded into the sports industry prevents people of minoritized ethnicities from becoming coaches. I also wonder why such a large percentage of baseball players are white. Do former sports players become coaches? If so, why are the racial demographics of coaches so different from the racial demographics of players?\n\nThis impacts my community because my city has several sports teams (a basketball team, a baseball team, and a soccer team). My city also has a majority Black population. It is very possible that African American coaches in my city are discriminated against and have trouble finding jobs coaching major teams.\n\nHeadline: Where are the coaches of color?"

I notice how National football has a high amount of players of color at around 74%, but the lowest amount of coaches of color at 13%. Lastly, Baseball seems to be low in both areas, lacking players of color and coaches below the 50% mark.\n\nI wonder what these graphs would look like in maybe 10 years' time. Generally, we would expect all of these numbers to keep increasing, as a more diverse community is crucial to advancing as a whole. I also wonder what is the current status of other predominantly white sports such as golf, or tennis.\n\nMy community is definitely affected since New Hampshire is one of the whitest states in the country. My community is definitely trying to push for more diversity in sports, and really in anything we do. It's important to get people from all walks of life involved, to better lift our community upwards.\n\nTitle:   \"The need to overcome adversity, the answer lies in diversity\""

I wonder why there are so many more players of color compared to non colored players, but the opposite for coaches. I feel like the ratios should be closer to each other, because then it would keep the same percentage of colored people in these five sports leagues.\n\tThe effect this has on my community is that these graphs show how much of an outlier we are. From my experience playing sports my whole life, I have noticed that there are a lot more white players than players of color, and the same for coaches. This fact must arise because of how many white people, and people of color live in our community. If there were more people of color living in our community, we would see more players of color. But since our community is heavily white, the number of white players outnumbers that of the colored players.\n\tI would title the name of these graphs, “Racial Diversity in Professional Sports”"

This contrasts with the MLS, in which 60% of players are of color, but 41% of coaches are of color, which is easily the highest percentage out of all American major league sports.\n\nI wonder what history has to do with this.  Do certain sports have a lower or higher player/coach percentage of color because of its history, or is there no relationship.  In addition to this, why does MLS have the best ratio of player to coach?\n\nSports is one of the if not the most popular pastime in America. Millions attend and watch games from either the stands, or more likely during our current situation, over television.  The graphs given show America's history, and the inequality that has existed between those of color and those not.  \n\n“America’s history is hidden within our favorite sports.”"

    "original_comment": "I noticed that for all five of the sports, there is a much higher percentage of players of color, than coaches of color. Male and female basketball has the highest percentage of players of color at 83%, but the percentage of coaches of color is still fairly low. The sport with the highest percent of colored coaches is Major League Soccer at 41%, which means that 59% of the rest of the coaches are white.\n \nI wonder if these percentages would be significantly different five or ten years ago, or in five or ten years ahead. I also wonder why the National Football League has such a high number of players of color, but the numbers for the coaches of color are so low. \n \nThis impacts my community and I for many reasons. Since Portsmouth lacks diversity, we don’t necessarily see as much racism as much as it exists around the country. As displayed in the graphs, there is clear evidence that there aren’t many professional sport coaches of color, as there are players. This tells us that there is some aspect of racism, and there needs to be changes regarding this. \n\n“The Lack of Diversity in Professional Sports”"

The players have higher rates of colored players than that of the coaches, and only baseball has less than 50% of their payers identify as colored.  The Women's National Basketball Association and the National Basketball Association both have the same percentage of colored players, and similar percentages of colored coaches.\n\nWhat I wonder:  Why are the coaches so much less diverse than the players?  What may have caused this? Does the time at which the data was recorded affect the amount of diversity?\n\nImpact: This graph has the potential to impact our community both positively and negatively.  Although it does promote racial equality in sports by encouraging the fact that people of color are able to be treated equally, it also shows that there is a lack of diversity among the coaches, which could potentially spread the message that people of color are less worthy of leading than those not of color.\n\nHeading: Are Sports Teams Really as Diverse as We Think?"

    "original_comment": "After examining each graph, I noticed that four of the five sports listed have done a great job of diversifying their players. However, all are rather lacking in the diversification of those in leadership positions. I also noticed that in sports like Basketball, a sport dominated by people of color, the number of head coaches of color is rather low. The percentage of head coaches of color is even beaten out by soccer, which has 23% less players of color. I wonder why sports like football and basketball, which are dominated by people of color, have so few people of color in leadership positions. I also wonder why baseball, when compared to the other sports given, has such a low number of players of color. This impacts myself and my community as I live in New Hampshire, one of the whitest states in the country. I would imagine that if you were to explore these statistics for highschool or college sports in New Hampshire that the results would be even more profound. While it is clear from the graph that people of color now have a well deserved place in the player base, it also shows that work can be done amongst coaches. Therefore, this graph provides possible insight into what these numbers could look like within New Hampshire.\n\nPossible Headline-“Leadership positions fall behind in diversity”"

To compare, the NBA and WNBA have the highest listed colored players. Also, there is a larger amount of diversity for players and not coaches.\n\nI wonder why the diversity percentage is so much bigger for players rather than the coaches? Is there a specific reason, like how many teams are in the sport, or is it because there are more players than coaches. I am also curious as to how each sport differs based on color."

I wonder whether each team has a similar proportion of players of color or if some have close to all and some have close to none. (Although a large majority of players are people of color either way). This impacts me and my community because of the biases and expectations that come with these kinds of patterns. In the example of sports teams and coaches/managers, there are many more white people in power even though people of color are the reason they are successful. This may keep people of color from those leadership positions in the future if change isn’t actively sought. \n\nA possible headline: People of Color are the Driving Force of Major League Sports Teams… But Who’s in Charge?: Racial Disparity in Sports"

    "original_comment": "I notice the proportion of head coaches of color is significantly lower than the proportion of players of color in the specified major sports leagues. Less than 50% of every league’s coaching staff are people of color. However, more than 50% of every league’s players are people color, besides baseball. MLS has the highest percentage of coaches of color, but is not necessarily the most diverse because it has the second-lowest percentage of players of color. This led me to believe there's not a direct correlation between the diversity in players and diversity in leadership. White Americans are the racial majority of the U.S., therefore, statistically, there are fewer people of color. However, I wonder why there's such a significant disparity between the percentage of players of color and coaches of color in every major sports league? I also wonder, as more awareness is brought to movements like BLM, will leadership diversity increase in years following? I think it's especially important to bring light on these racial injustices to communities like my own. Being a state that's 94% white, the system's racial inequities don't negatively impact the majority of my community. This data validates what people of color in my community and in the entire country, deal with daily. This graph compares the percentage of players of color to head coaches of color in major U.S. sports leagues, showing the discrepancy.

    "original_comment": "In all of the leagues, except for Major League Baseball, the majority of players are players of color. The four graphs have percentages over 50 percent. Even though players of color are not the majority of the players in Major League Baseball, 41 percent is a good amount. There is a small percentage of coaches of color within each league. There is not a percent that is over 50 percent. I noticed that the least diverse league is Major League Baseball. The league that has the biggest difference between coaches of color and players of color is the National Football League.\nI wonder why there is such an obvious difference in the number of players of color compared to the number of coaches of color. I also wonder why the National Football League has such low percentages of players of color and coaches of color.\nRacial bias is a major issue across our country and around the world. If this issue is occurring in a professional area like sports, then it is definitely occurring in other areas.Communities need to come together to fix this issue. It has been going on for too many years. Players of color could be lacking the confidence to become a coach. They could be analyzing the small percentages and seeing that the majority of coaches within sports leagues are white. This graph shows the major difference between the number of players of color and the number of coaches of color.A catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea is, “Play Ball! However, let’s let everyone play ball!”"

The highest percentage of coaches of color is 41% which is low compared to the highest for players of color which is 83% There are many more players of color than coaches of color in these professional sports. \nI wonder why there are so few coaches of color in these professional sports. I also wonder what discrimination might exist in these professional sports that may be causing the percentage of head coaches of color to be so low. \nThis impacts me and my community very strongly and it is very important. Our community is a predominantly white community, so people may not be aware of the extent to which the systemic racism in our country affects people of color. It is important that our community works to break down this racism and ensures that race has no effect on the opportunities that people are given. These graphs go to show that there are inequities in professional sports and that people need to be more aware of this, so that it can be put to an end. \nThis graph is displaying the percentages of players and coaches of color in professional sports. They display the fact that there are many less coaches of color in comparison to players of color, and that the percentages of coaches of color in all five sports are very low. \n“Lack of Diversity In The Game”"

    "original_comment": "From this graph, I noticed that quite a high percentage of players across several sports are players of color, whereas not many coaches are. This may mean that talent leads to POC landing player roles, but because of systemic racism and other things in society it is harder for POC to climb up in managerial roles and earn higher wages. Also, there is quite a gap in the percentages between players of color and coaches of color. The largest gap is in the NFL with a 61% gap, and the second-largest gap is in the WNBA with a 58% gap. From this graph, I wonder how the data in this graph from the years 2019 and 2020 compares to past years. It would also be interesting to see how this data compares with sports teams across the globe. One last thing I wonder is what our society can do to break down whatever challenges or barriers are preventing more POC from becoming head coaches. I feel that this data impacts my community in the fact that it is reflective of it. Much of our society is built on systemic racism and for this reason, POC face challenges every day because of their skin color. The fact that such a glaring difference in racial distribution is apparent in big sports leagues makes me wonder how much worse it is on a smaller, more local scale. The alternate title I have created for this graph is \"Lack of Diversity in Sports: How Equal Really is the Field?\""

    "original_comment": "1) There is a much higher overall percentage of players of color then there are of head coaches of color. And these variables don’t seem to be directly correlated with one another. Major League Soccer has the second lowest percentage of players of color (60%) but also has the highest percentage of lead coaches of color (41%). So “most diverse league” is a hard title to give. But “least diverse league” is pretty easy. With the lowest percentage of players of color (40%) and the second lowest percentage of lead coaches of color (20%), the MLB is, in my opinion, the least diverse league. That being said, even in the MLB, there is a clear gap between the percentage of players of color and the percentage of lead coaches of color.\n2) I wonder why Major League Soccer is one of the least diverse for players but the most diverse for head coaches.\n3) I come from one of the least diverse states in the country. When there is racial bias, it is easy for many in my community to ignore it because it doesn’t affect them personally. I have seen this happen as a person of color, and it's frustrating. I think it is important for people, especially in less diverse communities, to be aware of racial injustice.\n4) The main idea of this display is to show that there is a large gap between the percentage of players of color and the percentage of lead coaches of color. One potential headline is “When it comes to team leadership, are we telling people of color to sit on the sidelines?”"
