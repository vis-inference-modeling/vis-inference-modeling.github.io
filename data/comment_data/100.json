The graph shows the change comparison of life expectancy and health expenditures in various countries from 2000 to 2017.\n3. The graph tells that the life expectancy have increased in all the countries shown on it as the number of health expenditures increased. By examining the line changes shown on the graph, we can see the growth in both variables as the years pass. This means that as countries rely more on health expenditures, the average life expectancy grows as well.",

Something that I wonder is what if some people in the united states live higher than the life expectancy rate and some of the people in Japan live at a lower life rate. Would this mean that the chart above is inaccurate? because I do believe that there are some citizens that have or haven't lived at this life expectancy rate as it shows above.\n\n3.

It shows that America is not the top of the list, and actually going down on the list. It does show America compared to other countries has a great life expectancy, but not the best.\n      I think one of the main things that causes the life expectancy of America to be decreasing is from a huge drug crisis, shootings, and how almost half of the country is obese, and America being the most obese country in the world.\n       From how unhealthy the citizens are, and how many crimes are committed in America it overall just decreases life expectancy. America is the richest country in the world, and the number one country that invests the most money in health care, but still has a lower expectancy rate compared to other countries. \n        The thing with the other countries is that they are more healthy compared to America, which overall results in a higher life expectancy. Also the countries that have the highest life expectancy are wealthy countries as well. It also shows major countries with a lower life expectancy, but those countries are left safe or have a huge amount of people.",

However when looking at the highest Health Expenditure I noticed that it was none other than the United States of America; yet it only has a life expectancy of (78-80) years of age expectancy. Knowing this I can confirm that the price of the Health Expenditure doesn't have that great of an impact on the life expectancy. I wonder why is it that the US has to pay more for health care and still doesn't have the highest life expectancy; what other factors come into play when determining a life expectancy. it seems like it's still pretty much the same, the only impact it had was to show people a expectancy which could be them. \"What to Expect, the  Reality of spending vs Life Length.\"",

I'm curious if the pharmaceutical business and increased drug prices play a role in this. I have family members who require medication to treat illnesses, and the cost of the medication has risen over time despite no actual or minor improvements to the medication. For many families, the choice is between getting life-saving prescriptions and eating food that night. This shorter comparative life expectancy is most likely due to higher drug pricing.

India spends amongst the least on health expenditures and also has the lowest life expectancy. The US, however, spends the greatest amount yet has a lower life expectancy than many other nations. These observations led to several questions on the state of health expenditures worldwide. First, do the health expenditures reflect how much consumers are spending on healthcare or an individual government? Furthermore, could the lifestyle and choices of individual citizens affect average life expectancy regardless of how much a country spends on healthcare? And lastly, how do countries such as China, Italy, and Japan maintain a higher life expectancy despite spending far less on health expenditures? The statistics of this graph lead to a deeper story with many important lessons that affect our country. As an American, it is important that our government is utilizing its health expenditures and funding in a way that best benefits the public. Unfortunately, despite spending nearly $10,000 per capita on healthcare, the results on life expectancy have largely plateaued. By studying countries such as Japan and Switzerland, we can learn methods that can increase life expectancy and better influence our decisions.

I wonder how strong the correlation is between health care expenditures and average life expectancy. It is clear that in general countries that spend less on health care per capita tend to have lower life expectancies, with the exception of Saudi Arabia (which spends about as much as Italy). That said, countries with the highest life expectancies cover a large range of health expenditures per capita (Italy and Switzerland have similar life expectancies but differ in expenditures). This makes me wonder what other factors are at play. The impact that health care spending in the U.S. has on my community and everyone who lives in the U.S. is monumental. The leading cause of bankruptcies in the U.S. is medical issues, which cause around 530,000 families to file for bankruptcy each year.

This calls into question what the money we pay for healthcare is really going towards. Are health conditions in other countries just better? Does the US healthcare system essentially scam their citizens for profit? In my community, healthcare availability is more sparse and the graph shows that paying more in the US doesn't mean getting more. I wonder if Big Pharma and inflated prices of important medications play in this. I have family with type II diabetes and the cost of insulin has been rising over the years despite no actual or few improvements to the drug. And for many families, the decision comes to get the lifesaving medications or to have dinner that night.

That leads me to wonder how big of a role pharmaceutical subsidies and inflated medical prices play in the overall healthcare expenditures. I live in a very rural community thus the impact of health expenditures and life expectancy has a larger impact on my community. Rural communities don't have access to the caliber of healthcare service that can be accessed in urban areas. This graph demonstrates that even increasing expenditures won't necessarily improve life expectancy.

Now, if that has any relation to the graph, I am unsure of it, but longevity and healthcare are definitely relevant so I deemed it to be relevant.\n\nI wonder why the price ranges are shown on the x-axis.

That\u2019s the title of this comment right? So let\u2019s dive into what that means. The two variables being explored in this data are life expectancy at birth and health expenditure per capita. Now when we analyze the 13 countries on this graph, there seems to be no correlation between these variables. The United States spends over two times as much as Japan, yet Japan still has a higher life expectancy. China on the other hand spends almost a tenth of what the United States spends and still has a comparable life expectancy. I wonder why that is. I also observe that the 6 countries with higher life expectancies than the US, all have universal healthcare. It seems that socialized medicine, which has become quite the buzzword in American politics, is doing quite alright for itself. I wonder the impact this graph could have on American communities, knowing that the money the US is spending is not improving their life expectancies in comparison to other countries. And if the money spent is not improving their life expectancies, where is it going? Or maybe the better question is, to whom?",

First off, the <2,000 countries only spent an average of $11.20 per capita per each year of life expectancy. You could say that means the populations of the <2,000 countries spend an average $11.20 spent for each year of life expectancy. What about the >4,000 countries? Well, they average a lofty $75.50 per capita per each year of life expectancy, which is nearly seven times what the >2,000 countries spend. That is quite a difference. There must be a reason, possibly benefit for spending this much more. Well, there is. The <2,000 countries average a life expectancy of ~73 years while the heavy-spending >4,000 countries average a life expectancy of ~82 years.

The odd, part was that they smoked, drank, were fat, and ate terrible food regularly. The scientist there where nothing short of amazed. How could this place have such a long lifespan, yet be so unhealthy. The answer was community. The Rosetans, lived with 3generations under one roof. They worked hard to care for one another. We can look at the top country and find a similar correlation. Japan\u2019s cultural background is similar. Their entire culture is based on honor, and kindness. What can we learn. That maybe our communities in America should turn from spending more money on health, and instead on following the Rosetans model of community. In turn maybe we can see a little more life, in a better country.",

It showed the correlation between life expectancy at birth and healthcare expenditure per capita between thirteen countries. The United States spends roughly $3.3 billion a year on health care alone and our life expectancy is 79 years old on average.   To most, this might seem reasonable, but Japan's life expectancy on average is five years longer, and they only spend $630 million a year. That is five times less than what we spend annually. Like Japan, France, Canada, Italy, and Germany all spend between four to five thousand dollars per capita and have a life expectancy above 80. What are we doing wrong? \n\tJapan requires all of its residents to join their healthcare system as a category called statutory insurance. This requires them to apply for healthcare on one of the 1447 plans available. It's paid for by tax revenue, allowing the average person to only spend $5,000 a year. In the U.S. the average person spends $10,000 a year on healthcare insurance. To receive healthcare benefits you must apply unlike in Japan where it is mandatory for everyone. The U.S. has roughly 37 million people who do not have healthcare insurance. Making people aware of the differences in each countries healthcare policy might make us change how we view healthcare.",

The people who do think about it most, assume that if they live in a wealthy country then they will live longer than those who do not. After examining a graph, about average life expectancies and the amount spent on medical care I was very surprised. The graph shows how much a country on average would spend on medical care and how long their average life expectancies are. I saw that the two variables have zero correlation. For example, the United States citizens are spending the most on medical care but on average are living less long than those who live in Japan, Italy, France, Switzerland, Germany, and Canada.\n\t I think that some of the reasons other countries have a longer life expectancy than the United States are because of the environment of those countries. According to U.S.News, the best countries by the quality of life and social purpose in rank are Canada, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Australia, United States, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Sweden, and the Netherlands. This makes me wonder if the lurking variable is quality of life and social purpose. It also makes me think that in the United States we have less of a positive quality of life than those countries. In the United States, everyone is always competing against each other to best at your job or to be the most popular.

Self-care is often preached but also very often ignored in the work environment.

Think of families barely making ends meet too! In some of these families the parents work multiple jobs just to take care of their family, still can barely make ends meet and can definitely not feel like they can sacrifice a single day of work. Hourly employees often don't have vacation days to use anyway so every hour away from work is an hour of money lost.

The line showing Japans stats is very high, but Japan\u2019s health vs life expectancy is different. I am nit completely sure on why, but it could be due to the fact Japan is a small country and their land size and population is smaller. My reasoning for this is because Japan is a lot smaller than the US therefore they don\u2019t need to spend so much on things the US has to. That would include shipping costs food traveling costs healthcare and more. Japan has a smaller population than the US so they do not need to spend so much on things we here in the US need, for us we have a huge population as for Japan they are at least e times smaller than us. I have been talking a lot about Japan, but looking at the graph Switzerland is very high as well in life expectancy. I do wonder though what is making their expectancy so high that the US is falling short. China has a low health expenditure per capita but has a population of over 1 billion, and that is a little more than Japan, as for the the US out population is still large.

The problem isn't so much the population size as it is the fact that privatized insurance allows for the cost of procedures and prescriptions to be sky high, here in the U.S. The same prescription that might cost $350 here could cost $50 in a country with public insurance (often deemed socialist insurance plans).

It is common knowledge that Japan is a very advanced country and has the highest life expectancy, but the reason for why Japan was the highest was unknown. The line that shows Japan's stats is ironic, since it has a considerably lower health expenditure per capita than the US, but has higher life expectancy. I assume this is because of the land size and the population. The land size could affect it because since Japan has a smaller land area than the US and does not need to spend as much money for shipping and traveling costs. Also, the population of Japan is lower and the US's population is 3 times higher which means it needs to spend more money on health. I also wonder why Switzerland is as high as Japan. Yes, it spends more money, but what is making its life expectancy higher that the United States isn't able to replicate. Another thing I wonder is why China has a low health expenditure per capita but has a population of over 1 billion. This could be because of its communist party. The impact this has on my community, since I live in the US, is how my family and my health care is being prevented or limited. I personally have not been affected, but I wonder why the curve is going down for life expectancy. My opinion is that it could be those greedy insurance companies.

In this graph it is comparing health expenditures per capita for multiple countries and life expectancy at birth for those countries.

I also noticed how the US spends the most on medical care and yet their life expectancy is mediocre.

But most countries spend around 3,000 to 6,000 and have higher life expectancies. What I wonder is how? How do countries spend almost half as much as the average American and live 2-6 years longer? I suspect it has to do with what people spend on health and if they are using that money spent wisely. Or others lifestyles maybe they don\u2019t spend as much money on health, but they do lead a healthier life style with diet, exercise, and less stress.

Japan has the highest life expectancy but a mid-ranged health expenditure. Saudi Arabia also has a high health expenditure for its respective life expectancy. I wonder what each country's healthcare covers. I also wonder what has a larger impact on life expectancy: lifestyle or medical aid/healthcare. The overall shape of the graph is a curve that starts drastically increasing and eventually plateauing. In general, countries with a higher life expectancy have a higher health expenditure. \n\nThis impacts me and my community because the expense of healthcare is a huge topic in the US. Additionally, transitioning to a healthier lifestyle is being heavily pushed. Seeing that health expenditure is the greatest in the US but only life expectancy is not the highest, I'm curious as to what other countries focus on that allow for such a high life expectancy at lower costs. \n\nA headline could be, \"Does Healthcare Need to be Expensive for Living a Longer Life?\"",

Japan has the highest life expectancy and they pay about $6,000 less.\n3) Could it be that U.S citizens have more health problems and that's why the U.S spends so much money?\n\nHealth overall has a big impact on our community. I think one reason we spend so much money on health resources is because we don't promote enough appropriate and achievable health goals. I think as a society we expect people to be at their peak level of fitness in order to be considered healthy, and that obviously is not a reality for many people. Therefore many people don't make an attempt at leading a semi healthier lifestyle which can lead to expensive health problems and death.\n\nI think a title that would fit this graph is: \"How Much Money Are We Spending to Keep Ourselves Alive?\"",

Other countries like Japan and Italy have a much higher life expectancy; however, they have noticeably fewer health expenditures.\n\nI wonder why the U.S has a lower life expectancy, while they have the highest health expenditures. Another question that comes to mind is why Japan holds the highest life expectancy. \n\nThis impacts my community because even after having significantly higher health expenditures, our country doesn't have an exceedingly high life expectancy rate.\n\nA possible headline that summarizes this graph is \"Does paying more for health care result in a longer life?\"",

According to the graph, the United States was going up but then there is a curve that shows that the age range has gone back down.\n\nThe life expectancy has changed since 2000 because for example Japan is the highest country with the most life expectancy and India is the lowest country with the least life expectancy. I see that the colder countries have the most high life expectancy such as Russia. I feel like climate has a big part in this because it depends where the country is located that makes the life expectancy either high or low.

It seems like there is a positive correlation between life expectancy and health expenditures for these countries. However, this correlation is not entirely consistent (Saudi Arabia and the U.S are two outliers).\nI wonder what health care expenditures are. Is this how much money a nation spends on its health care? I wonder which of these nations have free healthcare. Does free healthcare improve life expectancy? I wonder what other factors influence life expectancies other than health care expenditures.\nThis impacts my community because it seems like our nation spends a great deal of money on healthcare but we still have fairly low life expectancies. This leads me to believe that only a small few have access to our great healthcare. Many people in Memphis have no healthcare.

Americans claim that the United States is the best country in the world, but when it comes to our citizen's well-being it's the lowest among other nations. Someone might expect that when it comes to health care expenditures there will be an increase. But, from 2000 to 2017, this relationship has not been consistent globally. I see that other states like Japan, France, and Germany have a higher life expectancy and what I have learned is that they make health care available for everyone. They don't even charge a single penny when going to the infirmary or clinic. I am guessing that the United States charges more for the hospital bill and that makes people want to spend less when it comes to getting their annual check-up. I wonder why the United States feels the need to charge more for individual health care? I wonder what the United States can learn from the other countries? I wonder how much money the government has to charge so much for many families? The question does on and on, but what I do know is that American health care is impacting a lot of families.

Why are so many people getting sick in this country? I'd like to know why. All I know is that something has to change because young people that should've lived long lives are being taken away too soon.\nHeadline:\n-\"Japan's Living Longer Than The Rest of Us!\"",

As you say, maybe healthcare expenditures is not the only factor that affects life expectancy.  What are countries that have longer life expectancies doing differently than we are?  What could we do that is practically and politically feasible?  Maybe your personal experience could lead you to a possible action.",

This graph really puts into perspective the long way we have to climb to in my community to have higher quality health for less money because in Switzerland they are excelling.

Switzerland is the best among all of the countries compared as it has more life expectancy\nthan united states and it is the second in health expenditure per capita.

Perhaps the world's biggest GDP does not automatically equal longer life.\nAlso, many of the lower expenditure countries have very quickly increased life expectancy judging by the steep gradient of the line, showing that they are developing at speed. The extra money spent at a lower level looks far more effective  at  increasing lifespan than when the country already spends a lot.\nWe can also see how Japan has a world-leading life-expectancy, maybe this is what is causing there old person crisis.",

Go to the source (listed below the graph) of these statistics and you will see statistics for all of the countries of the world and not just the ones labeled here.  Which countries not in the G8 have long life expectancies?\n\nWhat other factors besides healthcare expenditures affect life expectancy?  In your opinion, how do they compare in the size of effect?",
