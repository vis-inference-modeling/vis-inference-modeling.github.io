I also noticed that the first 4 groups are about what most people would consider basic human needs and/or civil rights topics.  Finally, I noticed that the other topics are all about either mental/emotional stress/struggles or physical stress/struggles.\n\nI wonder what the biggest challenge with travel would be for the highest income group.  I also wonder if the pressures and stresses listed were self-imposed or if they were imposed by others.  Finally, I wonder if there were any students that applied outside of the $40K - $155K range and what their topics were.\n\nI think this relates to me and my community of students because it is helpful for everyone to be aware of the different struggles people face based on their level of income.  Over the years, it has become extremely hard for students to think outside of their own situation, so this graph would help them do that.  It may also help students realize how big of a challenge the question is asking for when they go to write their own college application essays.\n\nThe title I would give this graph is: \"Life's challenges, by household income, as told by University of California applicants\"",

What I mean by this is the difference between the topics of economic insecurity, abuse, and domestic instability falling to households with an income of 65k and under, while topics like travel, sports, and failure fall to households with an income of 125k and over. While looking at the graph, I also noticed that the vast majority of the essay topics had some form of negative connotation. I wonder what percentage of students\u2019 essays that were surveyed for this fell into Other/Miscellaneous categories. I also noticed that the essay topics were gathered for a specific essay prompt that applicants may answer, out of many different options. I wonder how this fact affected the range of essay topics and what the data would look like if it included other prompts. Since this data was compiled for only the University of California applicants, I wonder how this same data breaks down for different schools or even by state.",

I think the reason why mental health is so high up there is because of how expensive things are due to inflation and rising prices so people put their mental behind because they know they need to get their necessities first before they can have any enjoyment but how is that possible if it is so hard to climb up in income as it will take years before you can see a change in income and a few months or fewer for your mental health to decrease.\n\nThis relates to my community cause in Hawaii almost everyone deals with financial issues and so we deal with a lot of abuse, mental instability etc because of this. My family doesn't have a high income here in Hawaii but happily there is no abuse or mental instability but the things I am dealing with is financial aid for colleges, academics and sports.\n\nAfter thoughts (reveal): I agree that the SAT and ACT could have potential bias towards specific students. This goes the same way with the background of a person's applicant as they can be biased too because of their race, wealth and disability which is hard to make of on how you can\u2019t make someone's personal info unbiased.",

However, people around the middle-percentiles of the ranges of income tended to talk about everything inbetween the serious and more leisure activities and moments. \n\n2. If colleges receive essays where students from lower-income families tend to talk about economic insecurity of different kinds, why do they continuously impose strict student-debt policies and ask students to buy many assets that they won't need to use? Plus, it's not like they'll go broke if they lifted these rules. \n\n3.

In a way, topics such as Economic/Material Insecurity, Immigration, Abuse are more about how the outside world affects them, while topics like Failure, Sports, and Relationships are more about their own actions. This could be because many students of higher income are aware of their privilege, and instead of writing about things that were given to them, they write about topics they were more personally involved in. \n\nI wonder about the distribution of the data, and how many essays were actually written about each subject.

In lower income essays, they mainly talked about immediate problems that are much more likely to happen when you are poor, like the chances of abuse, hunger, and lack of affordable housing. In middle class essays, they mainly talked about emotional difficulties, which are likely to happen if you're pressured by those around you to rise up the social ladder and become wealthier. And in wealthier families, most of their problems stem from their wealth, like maybe a problem during a vacation or a sports dispute, extras that the other families would be less likely to afford. \n\nOne category that really stuck out to me was discrimination, and how it was firmly in the middle of the income range. I guess maybe when people of color are a part of the middle class, they are likely to live in suburbs, which might be more discrminatory to them. Or, maybe it's because if you're an ambitious woman or POC or both, you might be more likely to encounter bigots who will try to slow you down.\n\nThis isn't really answering the questions, but were observations that I made.

For example, asking students to classify their own essays means that the students could simply classify their essays incorrectly, or in a way that doesn't line up with the other essays. Another issue with self-reported data is sample bias because if responding or sending in an essay was optional, then the only responses you'd get are from the kind of people who would actually respond, and with something like income, in particular, it is possible that certain income groups are as a whole more likely to respond which messes up the data in a way that has to be considered while analyzing the graph.",

And not only is it a privilege to be able to talk about mental health and be helped with it (since not everyone has access to that), traveling, which had the highest data point for income, is definitely also another huge privilege to be able to do since not everybody can afford to do that unnecessarily.",

Most of this graph would be working class families, but even on the higher end, that might still only be considered middle class.\n\nI do wonder if there was a reason for choosing the selected categories on this topic for the graph.\n\nThis does relate to me and my community due to the fact that everyone in my community has different wages, and each person has their own sets of problems. That, however, doesn't mean people from low or high income families can write about different topics outside of their income.

On the other hand, higher income families face problems more akin to being being an outcast, extracurricular activities, academics or rejection. I wonder how many low income families go off to college because you sea a large space between 40k and 55k in the lower income section of the graph. You see similar gaps in the higher income families which could be due to having enough money and not feeling the need to go to college.My parents make good money so I think the same would apply to my community placing myself around the middle saying one of my bigger problems  is academics.

(Bias is the tendency to favor one thing over another.  This is different than statistical bias that is the tendency of a statistic to overestimate or underestimate the \u201ctrue value\u201d of a population of interest.)",

This relates to my community because we all have different things going on in our lives and we may experience this later on if we decide to go to college. \n\n- If I could come up with a title for this graph it would be, \"Correlation between Essay Topics and Household Income\"",

Does it affect low- and high-income student family incomes in the same way (amount or percentage)?\nI can see why you may want to talk about outliers, but outliers relate only to quantitative data, like height or number of text messages.

For example, students with lower household incomes discussed serious, personal topics like abuse, immigration, and economic insecurity, while students with higher household incomes discussed topics like sports, failure, and travel that was not related to immigration and relocation.\nI wonder if students with lower average household incomes discuss mostly serious, personal issues because they were faced with lots of hardship in their lifetime due to their family's income, and are more open considering they likely experienced these hardships for most of their lives. I wonder if the students with higher average household incomes discussed more materialistic issues because they hadn't really been faced with profound, serious hardships due to their economic stability and only really knew materialistic issues in their lifetime.\nThis relates to me and my community because I am sure we have a wide range of average household incomes even within my school district alone, and our average household income likely impacts the issues we write about in our college essays as well.

When at $40k the only problem is economic/material insecurity which is a given as it is small compared to the large sums of money proceeding it. However, as money ranges from $80k to $105k you begin to experience worse issues like death, academics, mental wellness, as well as emotions and relationships. This makes me wonder if having more money is really as good as it seems, as despite having a lot of money seems good due to being able to possess more things you can than if you're poor you lose the satisfaction of work towards gaining your desires.

For instance, studence with lower income households deal with economic insecurity, abuse, and domestic instability. However, students in higher-earning households write about sports, relationships, and failure. When comparing the two different forms of subject material, the lower-income households deal with harsher circumstances. \n\n- I wonder if students of a higher-income background understand that there are many who are simply less fortunate than them. I am not implying that their issues are not worth writing about, but rather questioning their awareness in terms of the issues of other college candidates. I also wonder if the same applies to those of lower-income backgrounds. Do they realize that students of higher-income background write about less-severe topics? This is most likely due to the fact that since they are better off, they consequently withhold less severe issues. I wonder if a study can be done to address this query. \n\n- This greatly relates to my community and I for a variety of reasons.

I wonder if those who work in college admission offices tend to favor one type of essay written by someone with either a lower or higher level of household income, and if this impacts the decision on whether to accept them into the college or not. This relates to my community as there is a variety of levels of annual income, as well as a variety of different colleges attended by the young adults, ranging from community college and in state universities, to costly, out of state programs.

For example, a student living in a household making about $57K wrote about abuse they endured, while a student from a household making over $100K wrote about how traveling was a struggle for them. I wonder if any students from high income households wrote about the same things as students from low-income households. Is there any overlap?

For example, relatively lower income households, including from about 40k-80k, were more inclined to write about social issues including economic insecurity and immigration. This possibly indicates a glimpse to the personal lives of these students, suggesting a possible correlation between average income and how it effects home life. \n\n2) I wonder what the relationship is between how much income a family receives and the likelihood of the students in the families to face prominent social issues.  I also wonder if this position almost gives lower-income students an \"upper-hand\" when applying to colleges because it seems as though admissions officials strive to see more \"real-world\" personal struggle responses when asked a prompt like this, as compared to an issue not as intense such as sports. \n\n3) This relates to me and my community because as a high school student I will be writing college essays one day as well. It is interesting to self asses and reflect on how my family's financial situation can effect my perspective on life. \n\n4)  \"See Just How Much Money Effects Your Perspective On Life\"",

For example, student's that wrote about economic insecurity were in families with just under $40,000 income. Whereas students who wrote about travel were in families with much higher incomes. These two scenarios make sense because someone who is in a family with a much higher income would possibly travel more because their family has the means to do so.

I am curious about if the numbers for all of these incomes are similar or different in and which ways. Being a senior in high school I as well as many of my friends just finishes applying to colleges. I see where I fit into this graph and wonder where my peers do as well.

After viewing each subject section, I wonder if students who write gloomy essays are more or less likely to be accepted into a college.

If the person is from a low income family, they are in an economic pickle, so they are going to write about their biggest problem. I'll give you a small hint, their biggest problem is probably money issues. Higher income families have more money and they don't experience money issues. For example, one of them wrote about travel.

For example, those who have written college essays on Economic/Material Insecurity, Abuse, and Domestic Instability ranged a family household income from approximately $40k to $65k. In contrast, sports, failure, and those who struggle with travelling (unrelated to immigration and relocation) have a household income ranging from approximately $125k to $155k.\n\n2) I wonder if the type of university and family household income impacted the type of essay topic the college students wrote about. Is it possible for college students who have high household incomes to struggle with serious problems? How did they even pick the essays to display the following results>\n\n3) This relates to my community because the variety of household incomes are impacted by the challenges that people face.

For example, students who live in a household of well over 150,000 dollars will express minor problems in their college essay, with the main issue associated as \"travel (unrelated to immigration and relocation).\" However, students who make a reported household income of lower than 80,000 dollars will write an actual essay pertaining to immigration. While each subject is unique, it is clear that lower income households write more momentous topics.\n\n2. The graph makes me ponder on the amount of students in reportedly high income households who wrote stories on more serious topics. Since this is an average per topic, it does not include outliers. For instance, how many students whose households reportedly make over 150,000 dollars wrote essays on the subject of abuse?\n\n3. This relates to my community and I because the graph  portrays important population trends. New York, specifically Nassau County, are a very diverse communities.

For example, students with a household income lower than 80k chose to write about abuse, material insecurities, time pressures, etc, whereas students over 90k as their household income explore more personal issues, such as mental health, academics, sports, emotions, etc. This makes me wonder if the topics that these students choose to write about affects the quality of their writing. Do lower income students have a higher or lower chance of being admitted? Are there any significant outlier to this data? More specifically, are there any students over a 90k income who chose to write about immigration, or insecurity?

On the lower end,  more uncontrollable things, such as economic insecurity, or death can be seen, while the top are mostly related to things you might need a bit more money for. ( As in you need to travel or to participate in Sports). Lesser money correlates to more economic issues and all that it may entail. I wonder where the children got accepted in the end, to see the deeper end of how talking about these issues as your greatest challenge can effect acceptance. I also wonder how this might differ for other countries. Do colleges's collect such data to accept a varied group of students?

The higher a family\u2019s income, the more likely a student is to discuss travel, failure, sports, and emotions.\n\nWhat do I wonder?\n\nI wonder how income specifically prompts students to discuss certain topics in their college essays. For example, having low income for a family can cause stress on parents and children; never knowing if there will be food on the table can lead to abuse and poor domestic relationships if stress is not dealt with in a healthy way. Perhaps students with low domestic income have immigrants for parents and therefore have less economic opportunity than kids who have native-born parents. On the other hand, students with a higher domestic income probably had a higher education than students with a lower domestic income, as a result, there are higher expectations for those students to succeed, and they probably discuss their fear of failure on their college essays. They have the money to participate in sports and discuss their hardships/ experiences in the game. Maybe they aspire to travel which is something students with lower income couldn\u2019t dream of.\n\nHow does this relate to me?\n\nMy community for the most part is middle class, so perhaps the hardships we discuss on our college essays will not be about money.\n\nTitle: Does Financial Insecurity Lead to Maturity?",
