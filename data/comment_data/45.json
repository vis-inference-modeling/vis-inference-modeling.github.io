Across the board, it can be seen that even if portion sizes changed minimally, the calorie count went up. This can especially be seen in desserts, where the portion size went up by some but the calorie count nearly doubled. This graph says a lot about modern day food and how Americans eat. We have a culture based around fast food, which has tightened its grip over us in the past half century and in doing so has also lead to an increase in the consumption of calories. This ever-growing epidemic is what has led to America\u2019s two biggest problems, diabetes and heart disease, and is a predicament that needs to be controlled before it gets completely out of control. From a very young age, American children are institutionalized to like fast food because companies market such food towards them, and this begins the cycle of addiction and consumption that leads to these problems. Promoting healthier eating from a young age would be one thing that could help to break such a cycle. In all, these graphs are a great demonstration of how unhealthy food has become.",

What graph may tell an interesting story that could even have \"legs\" -- follow up on the worst culprits?",

Also, in 2016 the calorie amount went up quite a lot for entrees. For Sides, the same thing happened portion sizes went up Little by little but they stayed roughly the same this time but the calorie count went up a lot. But this is most noticeable for desserts because the due date for the 2000s they were pretty close and then for 2016 the calorie count went up a lot in the serving size was a lot larger.",

And in to days world people are looking for smaller and heather food to eat. So we should look at this and relize what we are doing to our food.

A catchy headline that could capture the graphs main idea is \u201cHow Much Are You REALLY Eating?!\u201d The graph is showing people there intake of calories based on their portion size.",

I also wonder if you added data for three more years if the numbers would continue to increase? Another wondering is if you decrease the portion size if the calorie count would go up, down, or stay the same? In this graph, they took the calories and portion grams from only fast food places. They took data from three different years and three different meal types and they all had different results. A good headline could be \u201cCalories Galore! Where Does It Stop?\u201d I think this could be a good headline because there are definitely a lot of calories and who knows when will the number of calories will stop increasing? If you continue to do the graph, you could have calories up too 1,000 calories in all sorts of foods and desserts.

They definitely should still have the bar that has the date of 2016 because that was just three years ago but the date that has 1991 that means it was 28 years ago and for the date that said 1986 which means it was 33 years ago.

If it was backward like the portion size goes up and the calorie count when down. It would kind of make sense but sometimes it wouldn\u2019t make sense.  I wonder why they didn\u2019t put on the graph a popular dish that had a lot of calories and then compare it to another popular dish that had not that much calories from the 1986, 1991,and 2016 dishes.

By now, people should have realized the negative health consequences that come with continually eating at fast food restaurants. The serving size and calories of entrees, sides, and desserts at fast food chains have all increased significantly over the past thirty years. The category with the highest increased in calories was the desserts, which increased from 234 calories in 1986 to 420 calories in 2016, demonstrating that Americans continue to eat larger portions of more unhealthy foods. The number of calories in the average dessert is equal to the number of calories in an entree, clearly showing how unhealthy foods continue to dominate and prevail in fast food restaurants. The increasing unhealthiness of foods in restaurants is clearly a direct cause of the increasing levels of obesity in the United States.",

If so, Americans should be extremely concerned about their health and should avoid eating out as much as possible.

The only way to avoid complicated health issues that are affecting people all over the country, such as obesity, are to bring those serving sizes and calories back down. Even better, people should ensure that the number of times they eat at fast food places is as minimal as possible in order to avoid the temptations of ordering high-calorie desserts and burgers.

However, the portion size from 1991 to 2016 is the largest in the dessert category which raises the question as to why dessert was the meal with the biggest change? I have come to the conclusion that the dessert was the largest increase because the demand for larger portions in this category may have been greater than the demand for the other two. Dessert may also be taking the lead as it may have to do something with income. Restaurants and food chains may have recognized that people want more dessert and are willing to spend more for \"their money's worth,\" which is why increasing the portion size would be beneficial. Finally, the portion sizes are most likely a reason for why there has been an increase in obesity and illness in Americans in the last 20 years.",

If so, Americans should be extremely concerned about their health and should avoid eating out as much as possible. The size of fast food servings has been increased to accommodate the growing size of Americans. The only way to avoid complicated health issues that are affecting people all over the country, such as obesity, are to bring those serving sizes and calories back down. Even better, people should ensure that the number of times they eat at fast food places is as minimal as possible in order to avoid the temptations of ordering high-calorie desserts and burgers. If the people in the U.S. want to decrease the levels of health problems such as diabetes, high cholesterol, and obesity in their country, they must restore the lower-calorie foods to restaurants or completely avoid eating at fast food places.",

I can see that this is true for both the  entrees and the sides. The evidence to support this that we can see that the portion size goes from 162 g to 169 g all the way to 201 g in a span of 30 years. Along with that, the amount of calories in each portion size has also slowly increased from 162 calories, to 201 calories. Along with this, the portion size for the sides has increased as well, from 115 g to 119 g. But the calories have gone up much more significantly in the sides, from 175 calories, all the way to 217. This may be happening due to the amount of junk food and fast food being produced by companies like mcdonalds or KFC that are causing people to eat more and to increase both the portion size and the amount of calories as well.",

It also exemplifies how Americans portion sizes has increased over the last 30 years and their need for sugar  and other unhealthy options. In the last 30 years, it has become increasingly difficult for Americans to avoid fast food and it is a contributor to the obesity crisis in America. There seems to be a direct link between more fast food institutions in a certain areas and higher obesity rates.

Does this information apply just to America or internationally? If they pulled information internationally, the averages would be affected drastically. In other countries, citizens generally eat smaller portions. The change in calories in sides from 1991 to 2016 is astronomical compared to the change in portion size (which is virtually none). It is also mind-blowing that the increase of calories in desserts has almost doubled from 1991 to 2016, while the portion size has gone up about 50 grams. What would happen if they had data from a year in between 1991 and 2016, during the supersize epidemic? Does that still play a vital role in portion size and calorie count even if Americans understand how unhealthy it is? Even if we realize how terrible fast food is, why do we still choose to eat it? Over time, as fast food restaurants expand their menus, they bring in more consumers and generally increase the calorie count in order to appeal to more people. The bacon craze is also very prevalent; bacon is now available on almost every item on  fast food menu.",

This could be due to a lot of things, such as globalization of large corporations, catering to the \"growing\" size of our populations, and other factors. The growing size of the fast food industry and competition among the corporations means that the food they serve could go in either direction in terms of quality. In an ideal society, close competition in the marketplace would lead to the competitors striving to attract more customers with higher quality items, however quite the opposite is true in the real world. Modern corporations reach for quantity over quality and market lies through heavy advertisement to drill their food ideas into the minds of the public. The graph could show the loss of quality in food through the use of lower quality and higher calorie items that contain sugars, sodium, fats, and preservatives so that the fast food joints could sell more food for less cost to the company. \nThe next thing this graph could show is how corporations are catering to the \"growing\" size of our populations. In the U.S., we are facing an epidemic of obesity, and fast food corporations have fallen under the limelight of blame in past years for this issue. This catering to size can be seen in fast food history, such as the supersize craze of the early 1990's to the mid 2000's. The graph shows the year in 1991 right before McDonald's dropped the idea.",

From the small portions and the high calories it is very hard to just get one of something.

    "comment info": "In this graph, I notice how the proportions and calorie count of entrees, sides, and desserts have increased over 30 years. I was particularly shocked when I saw the increase of the calorie count of desserts. In 1986, the amount of calories in desserts was only 234 while the calorie count now is 420. The calorie count now is almost twice the number of calories than in 1986. From this graph, I can see that Americans slowly eat more than before which has benefits less people suffering from hunger, but can also lead to being overweight.\n\n       One thing I wonder about this graph is if the serving size will continue increasing. If the number of calories and proportions of these foods now are already almost 2 times the amount as 1986 and continues increasing, in the future, the serving size might become 3 or even 4 times the amount. \n\n     If this trend keeps continuing, a person might be in danger by eating too much calories per day. To stop this, the fast food restaurants should make the foods healthier. There are many other foods that can be healthier substitutes of the foods served in fast food restaurant. By making the foods heathier Americans can eat more without gaining as much weight.",

You may want to check out the \"What's Going On In This Graph? release (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-oct-17-2018.html) from October 18, 2018.  It includes a graph from the article \u201cObesity Was Rising as Ghana Embraced Fast Food.  Then Came KFC.\u201d  America is not the only place that dreams of fast food.\n\nPlease remember that there may be an association between fast food calories and obesity, but without a controlled randomized experiment you cannot say that there is causation.  There may be other factors.  To read more about the difference between association and causation, read this week's New York Times Upshot article \"Five Reasons the Diet Soda Myth Won't Die\" (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/upshot/diet-soda-health-myths.html).",

Throughout the graph there is a steady rate of calories to serving size but in 2016 the entree serving size jumps to 201 and calories goes to 416. The same thing happens in the sides and desserts graphs all in 2016 there is a big jump.

Those three sections are labeled entrees, sides, and desserts. Each section has a calorie count measured in grams and if you follow the numbers and look at the year those numbers where collected the graph tells you that calories over the years has increased.

At first fast food chains were just restaurants that you went to when you were lazy or out of time to cook, but nowadays, for many people it serves as the main source of food. So the need to make larger portions and to meet the needs of customers. The restaurants also need to think about their competition, and offer larger portions and tastier attracts public. I wonder how far the ethics of restaurants go about the quality of the food they serve. Quality when it comes to how many calories, fats and sugar they put on their plates, as these things can be relatively addictive for some people, and harmful to health when ingested constantly and in large quantities.\n\n\u201cTHE HEALTH YOU CONSUME\u201d",

I\u2019ll share with you what I know and then ask you a question.\n\nWhy did they only do three categories?  \nThe researchers acknowledge that they did not analyze beverages (sizes in ounces were not always given) and either condiments, like ketchup, or multi-components meals, like combo meals (incomplete data for all restaurants and years).  \n\nWhy are the years spaced unevenly?  \nThe data was from different sources and that maybe why the years are not spaced evenly.  The 1986 and 1991 data was from \u201cThe Fast Food Guide:  What\u2019s Good, What\u2019s Bad, and How to Tell the Difference\u201d and its update by Jacobson and Fritchner.  The 2016 data was from online websites.  \n\nWhy did they choose this style of graph?  \nWhat other type of graph would you suggest?  You have the data so you can make another set of graphs with a different type of graph and compare their effectiveness.  Please share with us your conclusion.\n\nPS    I taught at West Middle School in Waltham, MA years ago.  Is that your school?",
