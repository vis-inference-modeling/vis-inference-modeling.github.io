Most of the states for example, Georgia, Texas, Kentucky, etc, are in the south and have abortion either banned or will be banned and have a heavy push for abstinence in their sex education. Even some liberal states have abstinences pushed in their education such as Oregon and Washington, but, abortion is available when needed. The biggest surprise to me in this graph is Virginia. They don\u2019t have abortion banned or ready to be banned nor do they push for abstinences. What I wonder is the root cause for why these states are. For most they are self explanatory, they were in the south er go they are conservative, but some continue to wonder me. This affects my community because as a whole, we in the United States should stick together in manners of issues such as this. If I could ad a headline to this graph it would be \u201cwhat does your state say about sex education?\u201d",

Expecting kids whose brains aren't fully formed and who are vulnerable to peer pressure to practice abstinence is unrealistic. Unless these states are providing easy access to other methods of birth control and educating students about them, they're contributing to the situations that create a demand for the abortions they won't provide. What their ultimate goal is baffles me.",

States that are typically liberal, such as California and New York, have large populations of women of reproductive age and allow abortion without stressing abstinence in sex ed. Typically conservative states like Texas and Georgia restrict or ban abortion and require abstinence to be stressed in sex ed. I notice that states with large populations of women of reproductive age aren\u2019t just one way or another. For example, California and Texas are the two largest squared with completely different laws and rules.\n\nI wonder how these squares will change over time?

Few states outlaw or restrict abortion and place little emphasis on abstinence.\n2. Based on this graph, I'm wondering if there's a link between sexual education in schools and abortion. Is it true, for example, that the more abstinence is taught, the fewer abortions there are, and vice versa? Or our decisions are influenced less by what we learn in school and more by the circumstances we choose to surround ourselves with. \n3. Although abstinence is strongly advocated in schools in New Jersey, abortion is available. NJ is also close to other states where abortion is legal.

Abortion is more readily available in states that do not encourage abstinence. I also see that Texas is the only state (along with California and New York) that prohibits abortions and requires abstinence education. Few states outlaw or restrict abortion and place little emphasis on abstinence. \n\n2. This graph makes me question if there is a link between the sexual education given in schools and abortion. Is it true, for example, that the more abstinence is taught, the fewer abortions there are, and vice versa? Or our decisions are influenced less by what we learn in school and more by the circumstances we choose to surround ourselves with. \n\n3. As someone who resides in New Jersey I can see the influence sexual education has on students, and how it can relates to the abortion rates in the state\n\n4. \"The Effect Sexual Education Has On Abortion Rates in the US\"",

I notice a lot of states where abortion is heavily restricted or banned or likely will be soon located in the south of the U.S. As well as many of the states stress abstinence in sex education even if abortion is not banned. Also, most of the states that have banned abortion also are states that are on the Republican side of politics. \n2. I wonder if all of these states have banned abortion completely or if there are some exceptions. I also wonder, if there are no exceptions, if there are different consequences depending on the circumstances that lead the person to have an abortion.\n3. This relates to me and my community because New Jersey currently has not put a ban on abortion and it is available to so many in the state. Abstinence is taught in school, unfortunately, however, this tends to cause safe sex to be spoken less about when both should be explained equally. \n4.

    "comment info": "This graph demonstrates the various correlations between states who advocate for abstinence or not and whether they restrict abortion or not.  One of the main things that stands out is how states like California and New York do not have heavy restrictions on abortion, but also do not stress abstinence.  On the other hand, states like Texas and Florida both restrict abortion and require abstinence to be a part of sex education curriculum.  One of the main trends is how the southern states have the higher restrictions as well as stricter enforcement of abstinence teachings, whereas the northern states do not.  It also appears that the states who restrict abortion in comparison to those who do not is rather even.  I wonder how this chart would have looked 50 years ago when the Roe v. Wade decision came out.  Would there be more states with restrictions?  Would states emphasize abstinence more?  I also wonder how politics come into play with predicting which states will soon restrict or ban abortion.  This graph is relevant to me and my community because abortion is an extremely controversial subject in politics and people feel very passionately about their opinions.

In California, abortion is very accessible. I also noticed that abortion is very\u00a0restricted in several states down south, which are known to be more\u00a0Republican. While states that are strongly against abortion are mainly democratic states.\n\nwhat I wonder \n\nI'm curious about why states that restrict abortion wouldn't promote abstinence meanwhile states that support the right to abortion do. I also wonder what topics are taught in different schools where abstinence is not a priority and how their school systems compare to those in various places around the nation. \n\nHow it relates to my community \n\nThis relates to\u00a0me and those around me since abortions are easily accessible in New Jersey. However, schools are required to teach abstinence, which I disagree with because instead,\u00a0they could be teaching about safe sex.

We were taught that the only assured way of not getting STD\u2019s or STI\u2019s was through abstinence as well as stopping a pregnancy.

Abortion access is important for us to continue to have choices over our bodies. Not only that, but as students what we\u2019re taught in sex ed can change a lot of things for us. If states are focusing on abstinence and not other forms of birth control, teen pregnancy may go up. With no options, we may have more teen parents.

Besides that, the vast majority of states that ban abortion also stress it in sex education, with 4 outliers (the Dakotas, Wyoming, and West Virginia). This reflects the pro-life stance of Republicans, which also means that people in Southern states who want abortion would either need to illegally ship drugs in or trek far away to northeastern states to get an abortion.

Then I realized how majority of states that are threatening to ban or already have harsh abortion laws are in one geographic area which was a nice take away from the graph. \n\nI think it was really important to include the population parameters of women at reproductive age because those are the people who will be most greatly affected. Additionally, I'm really in awe at how much data this graph is able to convey especially with the \"stressed in sex education\" aspect. I wonder how this was decided on/measured. An addition I would make to this graph if it would keep it's clarity is what kind of sex education is stressed. Some states still heavily push abstinence as acceptable sex education compared to others that do a more holistic approach. I think that would be very interesting to see against the other data being visualized. \n\nAs a woman and an American, this graph is really scary to me.

I was a little confused because it looked like a wall of post it notes scattered around and thought that there could be a better format for this data. Then I realized how majority of states that are threatening to ban or already have harsh abortion laws are in one geographic area which was a nice take away from the graph. \n\nI think it was really important to include the population parameters of women at reproductive age because those are the people who will be most greatly affected. Additionally, I'm really in awe at how much data this graph is able to convey especially with the \"stressed abstinence in sex education\" aspect. Some states still heavily push abstinence as acceptable sex education compared to others that do a more holistic approach.

The majority of these orange sections also make up a large part of the stats that already mandated the stress of abstinence in education. I also notice that the majority of orange states who have not stressed abstinence are in the northern half of us and have quite small populations compared to the rest. Although it appears that the orange states are most likely right-wing swinging states, it is interesting to observe that not all right-wing swinging states are orange. There are a lot of things going on in this graph, however, without much more than infographic data it is a bit tricky to notice any specific trends. \n\nI wonder if the previous education policies have an influence on the direction of a state\u2019s current and future abortion policies. As restriction and banning abortion is much of a recent debate and social issue, I believe that the previous stance on sex education definitely has some effect. Sometimes I feel that this issue is much more on control and politics than anything.\n\nI live in a very liberal state with an aligning political view.

Almost all of the states which are orange are outlined in black.\n\nI would like to know the amount of unwanted pregnancies of these areas, and see how it compares to both abstinence-based education and the presence of abortion. \n\nBeing from a liberal area, I grew up thinking that a well-taught sex lesson was the standard.  Most of my educators, especially in high school, came at this with the mentality that sex is a very natural practice. But, our school also had a lot of religious students, who were exempt from this type of education, and were instead offered one by their churches, which mostly preached abstinence. A lot more of these students got pregnant accidentally compared to the students who attended the school lessons. As such, a lot more of these students had to drop out of high school, and were unable to complete their education.\n\nFor each state, the graph represents whether its sex education is based on abstinence or not, and whether that state has abortions largely available.

I noticed that the graph has similarities to the political US map seen after an election. Whereas, the states usually in red are where abortion is heavily restricted/ banned/ or likely to be soon. While the states that usually vote blue allow abortions. When focusing on the states that stress abstinence in sex education, there is a mix of Republican and Democratic states. 21 states ban/restrict abortions while 29 states allow them. \n\n2) I wonder how the states that ban abortions teach sex education compared to those that have access to abortions. Also, how do the teen pregnancy rates differ between states that stress abstinence in sex education?  \n\n3)  When it comes to important issues like abortions, politics always tends to intersect the topic into more arguments more troubling. It becomes a separation of the nation instead of unification. This relates to my community as I take part in my school's Teen PEP program. This program allows seniors to teach freshmen about their safety, abstinence, and sex education. It gives a chance for students both seniors and freshmen to stay informed and educated. As shown in the graph, New Jersey (where I am) is a state that allows Abortion as well as insists that abstinence is stressed in sex education. \n\nHEADLINE\nHow UNITED are the States Towards Abortions?",

An example of this observation is the southern states, which are usually conservative: Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, and others. These southern states are represented by squares that are orange and have black borders.\n\nI wonder if the states that stress abstinence in sex education in their schools have lower teen pregnancy rates than those states who do not.

In California, the right to abortion is accepted by many of citizens of this state, which is related to why the state is grey in the graph.

Overall, the country appears to be equally divided in numbers of women of reproductive age having access to abortions. \n\nI wonder how the correlation between states that are against access to abortions and teaching an importance in abstinence in sex education is created, perhaps because of the religious beliefs in those areas, since those that define themselves as religious tend to be against both abortion and premarital sex. Also, I wonder why the creators of this graph choose these colors for this visualization. The bright contrasting orange of the states opposing abortion against the faint gray of the supporting states makes the areas in orange stand out, which is a little disheartening as a female. \n\nAs a young woman in the US, this graph, as I mentioned, is very disheartening.

Abortion is a polarizing issue that, as the graphic shows, divides the country. There is a heavy concentration of abortion restrictions in the southern half of the US, while the abortion access states tend to lay north. It also appears that states that restrict abortion are likely also to stress abstinence. Only 4 out of 21 of the abortion-restricting states do not stress abstinence. From an east-to-west perspective, states along the Mississippi River tend to fall in the abortion restriction access. East of the river, abortion access states seem to have a more significant presence, while west of the river, it looks pretty half and half. Im honestly shocked by how divided America is and how opinions vary so much from state to state, even across small distances. I wonder what abortion opinions would be like on a district level per state. Would the divide be seen on that kind of level as well?

Also, without counting, it appears that about half of the United States requires abstinence to be taught in sex education and most of the states that don\u2019t require this have large access to abortion. \nThis graph is a unique way to view this data, but definitely not the most effective. As someone who was born and raised in Oklahoma who now goes to school in California, it is neat to see the differences between the two states. I have lived and experienced polar opposite environments. \nA catchy headline for this graph might be, \u201cAbortion in the U.S. Post Overruling Roe v. Wade.\u201d",

I did like how the states were displayed like they would be on a map though. It helped to provide a geographic dimension to the data.",

    "comment info": "1. I've noticed that the states with the strictest restrictions on or outright bans on abortion are typically those where sex education emphasizes abstinence. Abortion is more accessible in the states that don't emphasize abstinence. I also observe that Texas is the only state among the three largest (California and New York) that forbids abortions and mandates abstinence education. Few states prohibit or restrict abortions and don't place a strong emphasis on abstinence. \n\n2. This graph has me wondering if there is any connection between the sexual education that is taught in schools and abortion. Like, is it true that there are fewer abortions and vice versa the more abstinence is taught? Or the decisions we make have less to do with what we learn in school and more to do with the environments we choose to surround ourselves with. \n\n3. In New Jersey abstinence is highly encouraged in school, but there is access to abortion. NJ is also in close proximity to other states with abortion access. \n\n4.  \"Cause & Effect: Abstinence v.

        "comment info": "@Joelyna Did you notice that some of these states with no abortion rights and requires abstinence to be taught, are located in the South or the Midwest primarily? Are these states more conservative than those of California or Oregon? I agree with your #2, i'm also curious if there are less abortions in states that also banned or limited access to abortions. Do you think there are a lot of people in states where abortion is banned who do become pregnant and then must travel to a new state and try to get services there?",

    "comment info": "The first thing that I notice is that most states that require abstinence to be stressed in sex education are also states in which abortion is heavily restricted, banned, or will likely be banned soon. There are a few noticeable exceptions, like Illinois, North Carolina, Washington, and Oregon. I also notice that most states where abortion is heavily restricted are located near the South of the United States.\n\nI wonder how the size of each state is scaled in proportion to the number of women of reproductive age within each state. Does a state with 5 times the number of women of reproductive age compared to another state also have 5 times the area shown on the graph? How will the graph look if instead of the number of women of reproductive age, it was a proportion of women of reproductive age of the whole population of the state? Does a state where abstinence is stressed in sex education tend to make the population of that state support restrictions on abortion over time?\n\nI live in California, where abortion is both largely available and other forms of birth control are taught alongside abstinence. With recent events, it is clear that abortion in the United States is becoming more and more heavily restricted. I hope that California continues teaching multiple forms of birth control other than abstinence in sex education and keeping abortion available for all.\n\nHeadline: Abortion and Sex Education: Correlated or Not?",

Some of those states like Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, and West Virginia do not. But these states also have a lower number of women of reproductive age. The second thing I noticed was the map follows a similar trend to a maps that display the wining part of the electoral college. Many, but not all, red or Republican states are planning to ban abortion. This is the same for the blue or Democratic states where abortion is widely available.\n\n2. I wonder why abortion has a lot to do with the politics. It's easy to see in the United States the division, but I wonder why each states has their own individual reasons or values to allow or ban abortions.\n\n3. I feel this relates to me because of the recent Roe vs. Wade being overturned last year. There were large protest and a large change to the precedent the ruling gave to freedom of speech. I remember those but remember learning about the ruling before it was overturned and how important it was to some people's value of freedom.\n\n4. \"The Importance of Abstinence: States where Abortion will be banned and Abstinence is Stressed in Sex Education\"",
