The prices of eggs has almost gone up toss high as they have now near the years of 2015-2026. Most of the time the prices of eggs has steadied between two to three dollars, so I see why the price spike to 4.25 can be staggering. What I also notice is that there is a clear spike compared to the last year and now see it continuously going up. What I wonder is what about egg\u2019s specifically is making the prices spike this much. It is one of the most noticeable things as well as gas that has people worried about our economy. This affects my community because once the price of things start to rise I wonder what will happen in our future and if more than just eggs will become unaffordable.

This is backed by the data provided, as there has been a sharp increase of over 100%, as the price went from just under $2 to $4.25 in the past 2 years. This makes me wonder why the egg prices have been so extreme recently. \n         The article states it was due to egg laying birds being taken out by avian flu, however it is very hard to believe that is the sole cause of this sharp increase. By the data provided by the graph, that would have to mean that over 50% of the egg laying birds had to have been killed off by the disease, which seems highly unlikely. \n         This is an issue that relates to me and my community because eggs are a staple food that are meant to be affordable by everyone. Some families in my community rely on eggs due to their cheap and nutrient dense nature, and this recent increase in price could be very harmful for the food security of their households. \n         The graph is displaying eggs prices over time and then puts an emphasis on the recent sharp increase.

    "comment info": "The graph shows the average egg price over time generally increased, but the price fluctuated greatly in many years.  The most noticeable price fluctuations occurred around 2004, 2008, 2015, and 2022.  The first price spike occurred in 2004 but returned to a lower price quickly.  Around 2008, the egg price spiked, but increased and decreased more gradually than the other years.  The 2008 spike was the first time egg price exceeded $3.  In 2015, the average price of a dozen eggs increased by about $1 then dropped by about $1.50.  The most recent recorded increase shows a steep increase by nearly $2.50 in one year.  Because the writers adjusted for inflation, I wonder what major events relate to the price spikes, and if we can categorize the events.  For example, do the price spikes relate to political strife such as a war, or was there a disease plaguing major egg production areas, so people harvested fewer eggs?   I do not eat eggs frequently, so I did not notice the increased egg prices, but the article highlights that an American person \u201cconsumed an average of 278 eggs last year,\u201d so Americans must allocate more funds to groceries, or consume fewer eggs (Network).  Allocating more funds to groceries implies that people either work more hours at jobs, or depreciate other areas in their life such as entertainment and utilities.  Consuming fewer eggs suggests people change their diets and find egg alternatives.  \n\nEgg-streme Price Spikes: Don\u2019t Put Eggs in Your Basket",

    "comment info": "The graph shows the trend of the price of dozen eggs. Data has a pattern with volatility from 2000 to 2015, meaning prices change constantly. The cost of dozen eggs has been increasing since the start until 2015, when the price of grains used for feed decreased and caused a significant drop in the cost of eggs. That decrease caused a new line where prices were lower for the following years until 2022. Last year, millions of egg-laying birds got sick and died, raising the cost of dozen eggs to end the year at $4.25 per dozen. \n\n\nI wonder what the causes of the avian flu in 2022 that affected millions of birds were and what farmers can do to prevent this illness. \n\nThis relates to my community and me because my family consumes eggs daily, and we have been affected by the rise in the cost since it is something we eat a lot.  \n\n\nDo a dozen eggs cost in the sky due to \"birds flu\" or grain used for feed?",

Which makes sense because that was when everyone was scared to leave their homes. Also that very recently in late 2022 the price had significantly increased to an all time high.\n2.I wonder what causes a dozen eggs to rise in price in comparison to other objects. When egg prices go up are they the only dairy or good item to raise in price? Do people even know the few cents extra when they go to purchase their eggs? Why are eggs out of all food sources so needed that they are always having issues with supply and demand? I wonder how much profit is there for the companies when they sell at a higher rate or does the profit stay the same?\n3.This relates to my community and I because eggs are everywhere. For every recipe, cultural traditions and scrambled eggs are even seen as a cheap resource to buy since it is so accessible. Along with inflation also affecting everything we do. Affecting the lower-income negatively since it could be harder for them to afford the inflation price. \n4. Egg-spensive Times: Fluctuating prices of a Dozen Eggs for 22 years",

Since 2000, egg prices seemed to fluctuate with a gradual increase. However, the past few years after 2020 have seen significantly less fluctuation than the other years and rather a steep increase in egg prices per dozen. \n\nI wonder what the economical and environmental effects that may have caused this sudden increase are. The rapid spike in egg prices leads me to think that some environmental factor may be causing chickens to die at higher rates than ever before, leading to an egg shortage, higher demand, and therefore increased prices.  \n\nThis directly relates to my family and I, as we are avid consumers of eggs. We like eating them plain for breakfast, as well as putting them in dishes. Needless to say, we consume many eggs throughout the week and frequently have to buy more. This sudden increase in prices has impacted us, as we are more mindful of how much we spend on eggs and how rapidly we consume them. With the prices of eggs becoming more expensive, lower income individuals are less likely to be able to afford them in more recent years than they were before. This eliminates a healthy option available to them for meals, making them more likely to turn to less healthy alternatives that are high in sugars and fats.  \n\nEgg Prices on the Rise \u2013 But for Good This Time",

In regards to the pattern of pricing, a decrease is apparent after each increase and or \"spike\" in monthly price. Previously, the highest price was in 2015, now, as of December 2022, the average egg price is now at its new highest. The shifts in pricing seems to be a response to inflation. The additional graphs given also tell us the population of egg-laying birds are on a recent decline, and the food used to feed have shown an increase in price as well. \n2) What do you wonder?\nWhat events influenced the average price of eggs to increase over the years, and display such peaks in the graph? How will such inflation in egg pricing affect our community? \nHow will the graph differ if its data were to be based on years prior to 2000? \n3) How does this relate to you and your community?\nThe purchasing of eggs is quite common, as its use is popular in any given family. Regardless of such popularity, its increase in price, may strive away families from purchasing the item. This also further challenges families who are in a situation of financial difficulties.

Besides this gradual increase, I also notice a stark decrease in average price in 2016 from about $3.30 to $1.80, almost reducing the price in half. This has me wonder whether there was a certain policy that was put into action in 2016 that caused the decline of eggs. This could be concluded with inflation, but unlikely. I also notice a skyrocketing price of eggs in 2022. This also has me wondering whether there are some lasting effects from COVID-19 that have caused the surge in price.\n\nAs someone that regularly eats eggs for breakfast, this definitely has an effect on my daily routine, as I have been warier about purchasing eggs recently and have sought alternative breakfast choices. Furthermore, eggs are an American staple, meaning that this surge in price has likely had similar effects on many people across the United States. This could potentially mean that there is some distress in the agricultural sectors too, where chickens might not be laying enough eggs satisfactory enough for consumption. This could lead to a decrease in supply with the same amount of demand, and basic economic principles tell us that the price should increase.\n\nI think a catchy title for this may be \u201cConsumers are Scrambling for Cheap Eggs\u201d",

In the year 2018, the eggs were at their lowest price it has been since 2000. I also noticed that at what appears to be the end of 2021 and through the year 2022 the increase in price was exponential. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\n\nI wonder why the price of eggs had a sharp decrease in the year of 2015. Could it be because of a recession? I also wonder why the price increase was so rapid in 2022. Could it be because of a shortage of eggs or increase demand? \n\nHow does this relate to me and my community?\n \nThis relates to me and my community as my family buys eggs and a lot of them at that because we enjoy eating eggs for breakfast. The price of eggs has in recent years been expensive and so my family has been buying eggs less due to that factor. \n\nHeadline:\n\nEggs-amining Inflation of Eggs",

The price for eggs has reached its peak as of December 2022. Also I notice at one point in time the prices of the egg were $1, which is unbelievable since now the price are $4.25 for a dozen.\n2) I wonder if there is going to be another decrease in the price of eggs because of the decrease that occured in 2015? I also wonder if egg prices are going to be higher than what they are right now and what will eventually be the highest?\n3) This relates to me and my community because the increase of egg prices affects people financially since when the prices of eggs increase it's also a sign that other products will increase as well.

Also due the the skyrocketing price of gas, it also cost more for farmers transport the eggs, further increasing the price of overall production",

Egg prices are currently at their highest point in history, at $4.25 a dozen.\n\n-I'm curious what changes have occurred throughout the years. Was the pandemic a part in the cheap costs, or was there something else at work? I also worry what costs would be like in 20 years. I'm also curious what this trend will do for the economy and neighboring countries.\n\n-This affects me and my community because we consume a lot of eggs, and their pricing affects how much access we have to them.

With eggs being at a higher price and seemingly getting higher it may become harder to buy as many eggs as normal, many people may also stop buying and eating eggs altogether. There are also many households that have likely depended on eggs being a low price because they\u2019re a good source of protein and sometimes they may not have enough money to buy things such as chicken or steak.\n\nHeadline \nScrambled by Soaring Prices: Monthly Average of Egg Prices Reaches New Heights",

The average price of a dozen eggs reached its greatest point in December 2022, when it was $4.25, while it appeared to have been at its lowest point around the estimate of the year 2019. The underlying factors that appear to suit the data displayed in the graph are that the prices are so high due to the high cost of the grains used to feed the birds, as well as the additional factor that there is less egg-laying occurring. Raising the price of eggs would be the only way to solve this if there weren't actually any eggs being sold because fewer eggs were being laid by birds and the cost of feeding them was expensive.\n2. I'm curious as to why this might be as to what factors generally induce inflation in eggs. Do global effects have an effect on what is going on with the inflation of eggs? Since egg prices generally seemed to be rising years ago, I ponder what it would take to bring them down. When will the cost become too high to bear? Have we hit the peak, or will it keep rising?\n3.

This graph showed a positive tendency up until about 2016, when eggs would quickly reach an all-time low. From 2020 on, a new upward trend started, which would last until 2023.\n\n2. What is the cause for\u00a0price changes for eggs. Eggs just seem to be getting more and more costly each time, with no apparent justification for this. Does supply and demand play a part? Have hens formed a union and are they refusing to put in the long, arduous hours they once did? Eggs are the poster child for this trend because they are a staple on grocery shop lists and are now known for not being prohibitively costly. I can only infer that grocery stores and food in general are becoming more expensive.\n\n3. I think that most societies and populations depend on food. Most families visit the grocery store once a week, and I would imagine that the majority of them purchase eggs. My family has reportedly grumbled about the cost of eggs. I therefore cannot presume that other families in my neighborhood are also upset about the increase in egg pricing.\n\n4. \"Rise of the Planet of the Eggs\"",

There was a peak in an increase in 2015 when the prices of a dozen were higher than previous year but 2021-2022 has beat them to it now since they are $4.25. Inflation is a dilemma to the increase of prices of eggs since it has played a major role in the increase of everyone\u2019s daily lives.  It\u2019s very surprising that the prices of eggs were really low at one point in time since the price of eggs has significantly increased through the years. \n\nI wonder if the price of eggs is going to exponentially increase or is this just because of inflation and is it going to decrease like it has for the past few years?

I also wonder what was the reasoning for a decrease in the price of eggs after 2015?\n\nThis relates to me and my community because eggs are used in an everyday home where I live and since the prices of eggs have increased, so has everything else, it\u2019s not just eggs but mostly everything because of inflation.

In the first graph seems to be a lurking variable this is from identifying whether there is or isn't \"association\", this is because the years aren't the reason as to why the prices go up and down. However the lurking variables that seem to be fitting for the data shown in the first graph is that the prices are so high because the costs of the grains used for feedings for the birds are high as well as the including factor that there are less egg-laying going on. Therefore, if there aren't really eggs being sold because there isn't as many eggs being laid and birds and the prices for the feedings are high, their only solution to this problem would be if they bring up the prices of the eggs.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder if a possible factor was that the average price of the eggs where it was lowest was possibly because of the pandemic. \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to me and my community because within our local grocery stores there has been an increase in the prices of the dozen of eggs and it has an impact on other people because it causes them to spend more money to buy the eggs with a higher price.\n\nWhat's going on in this graph?\nThe EGG Domino Effect: How much is too much?",

What is causing the fluctuation in egg prices.  It seems as time goes on, eggs just seem to be becoming more and more expensive, with no real explanation as to why.  Is supply and demand involved?  Have chickens unionized and are no longer committing to their long grueling hours?  I can only assume grocery stores and food in general is being more expensive, and eggs are the poster child for this trend, as it's a very common item on a grocery store list, and is now for not being too expensive.\n3. I believe most communities, and people in general, depend on food.  Most families go to the grocery store once a week, and most of them, I'd assume, buy eggs.  I know my family has complained about the egg prices.  So I can't only assume other families in my community are complaining about the rise in egg prices.\n4. \"Dizzy for Dozens?

Even when the price was increased in 2015, when it was about $3.75, I've noticed that it's now at its highest point ever at $4.25. I've noticed that there hasn't been a time when prices have remained constant over the past twenty years. Either they are gradually rising or falling.  Which demonstrates how severe inflation has become and how gradually fewer eggs are being laid by chickens today than they were a few years ago. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI'm curious as to why the price went up in the first place. Does this mean that the chickens that we lost to avian flu aren't laying as many eggs, or that there is inflammation? A further question I have is whether the price will go down again or if it will only go up from here. \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nDue to the fact that I come from a small town where the majority of the population is from the lower to middle class, the increased cost of goods like eggs has an impact on both my community and me.

The price of eggs has always differed throughout the years ranging from around $1.75 in the 2000s to $2-3 in 2010. That is why the huge increase in the price of eggs in 2021 which costs almost twice as much as the average stands out. I also notice the cost to feed chicken has gone up, as the cost of barley and corn has duplicated. Not only this but March of 2022 was the highest month for chickens dying from the Avian flu.\nWhat do you wonder?\nI understand why the price of eggs has increased, there is no way to change the price of food to feed chickens or bring back the chickens lost to the Avian flu. What I wonder is when the prices of eggs will drop once again. Inflation has been going on for about a year or two now, but when are the prices gonna follow a pattern and drop once again?\nHow does this impact me and my community?\nThis impacts my community and me because it is very concerning to be on top of the prices of everything rising something as simple as eggs are now twice their original price.

The price of eggs has been gradually increasing over the last twenty years, and that there has been a spike in egg prices in the last three years, around the same time that inflation has increased quickly and the price of products has skyrocketed. Furthermore, in the third image [Egg-Laying Birds Lost To Avian Flu In 2022], we get some background for the current increase in egg prices. Not only is inflation out of control, but the number of egg-laying birds is declining, resulting in a higher demand for eggs and a lower supply, culminating in a price increase.\n\n2) I wonder if, similar to how egg prices fell after the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreak that affected US poultry farms between December 2014 and June 2015, egg prices will fall after the 2023 avian flu. I wonder how this inflation of eggs will affect other aspects of the food industry that use eggs within their dishes.\n\n3) This is relevant to my community because eggs are a common staple in most homes and used to be a cheaper choice for a simple meal or for protein in diets; now, they are tougher to come by, and families across the country will have to either pay the additional money or give up eggs. \n\n4) Cracking the Case on the Egg-cessive Inflation of Eggs",

The graph indicates that there is an average rise of $0.50 every five years. In the past 20 years, it has fallen as low as $1.50. Additionally, the cost rose to $3 before 2010, then decreased for a few years till 2015, when it amounted to $3.50 on average. However, it fell to $2 or less before starting to increase once more over the past two years. In December 2022, it was stated that the cost of a dozen eggs was $4.25.\n\n2)What occurred in 2016\u20132017 that caused egg prices to decrease? I'm curious as to whether the avian flu rises in the price of grains, or another factor is to blame for the higher egg costs. I also worry if the pattern will recur like in 2016 and 2017 when it spiked and then sharply declined.\n\n3)This relates to my community because almost everything we eat contains eggs, which has a significant impact on my community. As a result, fewer eggs are accessible for consumption, and their price goes up overall. Additionally, this drives up the cost of any other egg-based product, making shopping significantly more costly than usual. \n\n4)EGG-SCUSE ME! Since when was the price allowed to go up?",

    "comment info": "* The first graph [Monthly Average Price Of A Dozen Eggs] indicates a strong, positive relationship between the price of eggs and the month/year in which the data was collected. This shows that the price of eggs has been steadily increasing over the past twenty years; more specifically, in the past three years, we can see a spike in egg prices around the same time that inflation increased rapidly and the price of goods skyrocketed. Additionally, in the third graph [Egg-Laying Birds Lost To Avian Flu In 2022], we receive some extra context for the spike in egg cost in recent years. Not only is inflation going crazy, but the population of egg-laying birds is also decreasing, resulting in a greater demand for eggs and a lower supply - leading to a price spike.\n* I wonder if, as the population of egg-laying birds begins to increase, egg prices will decrease again - or will inflation keep egg prices where they currently are despite the egg-laying birds' population rebound?\n* This relates to my community because eggs are a common staple in most households, and used to be a cheaper option for an easy breakfast; now, they are harder to get, and families all over will have to either cough up the extra mula, or give up their egg-loving lifestyles. One of my friends has a bunch of happy \"egg-laying birds,\" so I personally am not deeply affected by this unfortunate price spike.\n* Big Eggs-pectations For Future \"Egg-Laying Bird\" Populations",

If your notice makes a claim, where in the graph is the evidence to support it?\nI notice that over time since 2000 there has been increases in the price  of eggs. For example, in 2020 there was a dramatic increase in eggs from a little under $2 to $4.25 in December of 2022. I wonder what caused this increase, was it COVID-19 and the recent inflation in the past couple of years?

These two factors have led to the highest price of eggs recorded in this century; a peak of $4.25 in December of 2022.\n\n2) I wonder if the loss of hens and the growing price of grains has actually harmed farming corporations. The most recent articles I've seen on the topic has claimed that these companies have been recording record profits in their egg sales, which seems to be the opposite of what is expected after such a large hit to egg production. Are the grain prices and avian flu really the cause of high egg prices? Or is there a lurking variable underneath it all?\n\n3) Grocery prices are one of the places where low-income communities get hit hardest by inflation. When every dollar counts in a weekly grocery trip, the insane price of eggs is something that really weighs in your pockets after only a couple months. Personally, people in my community have been helping out where it's needed by sharing cartons of eggs in their workplaces, and my neighbors have traded eggs with us for fish and other meats. While the situation might not be ideal, it helps highlight the way that communities lend help in times of need. \n\n4) Getting to the Yolk of It: What's REALLY Causing Those Egg Prices?",

In addition the Avian Flu struck Egg-Laying birds Harshly as millions upon millions of egg laying birds were lost this would result in less of a population of egg-laying birds with the demand being the same or more as years before so it would only be logically that the price would rise.\n\nDid the pandemic affect the price of eggs? Is population growth helping in the rise of eggs? Does the place where these egg-lying birds affect the production or health of these avian species? Is there added ingredients to what these animals are eating that may be a lurking factor in their success for survival?\n\nThis relates to my community as everybody has been affected by the rise in price for all sorts of foods that we eat on a regular day now our parents must really think to themselves if their salary is really enough for the rising prices of everyday food and objects.

The path to $4.25 has risen and fallen steadily over the years, with the most notable peaks occurring in 2008, 2016, and 2022. The lowest peaks occurred in the 2000s and near the beginning of COVID in 2019. Looking at the extra graph \"Annual prices of grains used for feed,\" it does appear that the grain price had a significant impact on the price of eggs around the year 2012 as the prices had reached their peak.\n2. Is the sharp rise in egg prices due to the loss of more than 15 million egg-laying birds due to avian flu in 2022? Also, why were egg prices significantly lower in the years leading up to the pandemic and for the first two years following it?\n3. This is significant in my community because the majority of us have had to deal with the financial consequences of COVID, and as the price of eggs rises, so does the price of everything else. Simple foods like eggs have become more expensive for people in financial difficulty. There is more of a supply problem than a demand problem, though both are present. Egg prices are affected by the chickens that lay the eggs, which are currently more expensive to feed. With all these factors that contribute to the supply of eggs, being able to provide food for families is more difficult and more of a strain than ever.\n4.

I noticed that every couple of years, there seems to be a pattern since at a certain point the prices drastically increase, they slowly decrease and stay constant for a while until it happens again. Also, after 2015 was the first time eggs went back down to the 1 dollar range since almost 2007. I noticed the increase in price that is happening after 2020 has the steepest slope. The price of eggs before it started increasing was lower than the price of eggs at the start of the graph in 2000.\n2. I wonder if all the increases in the prices of eggs were due to recessions during those years. I wonder why after 2015, the price decreased by a large amount unlike the other times when the price was high but would be lowered by smaller amounts. I also wonder about the max price for eggs until people stop buying them and how the current price has affected the number of eggs sold.\n3. This relates to me and my community because back then my family would buy two cartons of 24 eggs and after the price has increased a lot, we only buy one carton. Also, I have noticed that after the price has changed, my family has used less eggs and are finding alternatives to eat with their meals. Coming from an area that has a lot of minorities the price change has affected what people eat because eggs can be part of a meal for many that don't have much so now the cost affects what people are eating.\n4.
