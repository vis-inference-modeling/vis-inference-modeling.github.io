As humans, meat is a food group that we use almost everyday for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, making the rapid consumption into a bigger greenhouse gas impact. I can see why fish is the most wasted food product among everything else, and how meat and fish are the most damaging to the environment. As humans, reducing our carbon footprint regarding food is something that should be more looked upon as a major priority.",

The average hamburger is around 113 grams. That means for every hamburger there is approximately 35.4kg of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere.  Now on the other side of the picture we have a different graph showing how much people waste certain types of food. The most waste comes from seafood and fish. I would assume that\u2019s because seafood spoils relatively fast. If people were willing to prepare a serving of fish (which is typically around 140 grams) you would be emitting around 9kg CO2. This means that one hamburger would emit the same amount of CO2 as almost FOUR servings of fish. Fish is clearly the better choice when it comes to greenhouse gasses.",

The increase between lamb which has the second-largest greenhouse gas impact with 9.9 kilograms and beef is the largest increase on the graph. It increases about 7 kilograms, which is a greater impact than nearly half the foods on the graph. This shows me that beef has an extremely large greenhouse gas impact. I wonder why so much beef is bought by consumers and produced if there is evidence that shows the greenhouse gas impact. The second graph showed the amount of food that is wasted. The food that is wasted the most is fish and seafood, and the least wasted is grains.

First off, beef is significantly more damaging to the environment than the next closest food, lamb, yet it is consumed at a very high rate. Although I have no statistics to back up this statement, it would appear that Americans consume meat at a very high rate. Almost all of my friends are frequent meat eaters, so the fact that the beef has a large impact on the environment is concerning. I think the reason that beef is so readily consumed is because it is a component in many common American dishes and is easily accessible. People, especially those in poverty, will take whatever food is easily accessible to them. When meet is easily acquired by much of the population, it is rapidly consumed.\n\nThe next point you make is that perishable foods are the most wasted, which is important because it is preventable. Many Americans have access to means to preserve their food, meaning that these waste of primarily perishable goods is a choice, not an inevitability. If we can begin to take more care of our perishable foods, we won't have to consume as much as can hopefully decrease on the amount of food being created, thus limiting greenhouse gas impacts",

In second place for producing the most was lamb producing 9.9 kilograms of CO2. Nuts produced the least amount of CO2 at only 0.1 kilograms for 50 grams. This shows if you want to try and save the Earth being a vegetarian or a vegan might be the best way to cut down on green house gasses.\n\nFor the graph on the right I noticed that fish and seafood were at the top for most food wasted at 31%. I found this interesting because I though vegetables or fruits would be at the top since they normally spoil faster. In second and third place was fresh fruit and fresh vegitables at 25% and 24%.

Getting 50 grams of protein from beef causes the release of 17.7 kilograms of Carbon Dioxide into the environment.  This is almost twice the Carbon Dioxide that is produced when the same amount of protein is extracted from lambs.  According to the graph, lamb and beef account for just under half of the total amount of Carbon Dioxide produced by farming crustaceans, cheese, pork, farmed fish, poultry, eggs, tofu, beans, and nuts combined.  \n\nThe graph proves how certain diets such as veganism, pescetarianism and vegetarianism help minimize the destruction of the environment by limiting the production of greenhouse gases.  These diets promote sustainable consumption and use of animals and animal products.  Veganism is the most extreme of these three diets because followers limit themselves to absolutely no consumption of animals or their byproducts.  On the graph, a vegan would only eat tofu, beans and nuts which combine to just 1.5 kilograms of greenhouse gas produced from getting 50 grams of protein from each of the three foods.  This is just 8% of the greenhouse gases produced from 50 grams of protein from beef.

Not only does it include a vast amount of seafood waste, but the rest of the categories obviously do not belong to an impoverished nation or, as many have suggested, the United States.  A large county is more likely to waste more food, and while it may seem as though some impoverished nations could fit this graph, there would be far less waste present.  The US is clearly not the subject of this graph as the waste percentages are largely in the 20s and not in the 40s, 50s, or even the 60s.  Canada has had a large problem concerning over fishing in Lake Superior and consequently fits this graph perfectly.  Not only is the nation large enough to warrant wastage values in the 20s, but it also is amazing when compared to other nations' food waste management \"solutions.\"",

On the other hand, grains are more of a non-perishable and can be saved. In my opinion, if we all ate nuts and grains, we would be in a better world, but if meat was a person, it would be a legend. \n                I wonder why nuts use the least amount of greenhouse gas emissions? Wouldn't the farming, gathering, and packaging of the nuts use more than just 0.1 kilograms. Usually, nuts last longer than meat and seafood, so less of it has to be produced, which leads to less gas.\n                This graph shows each source of protein and how much CO2 they are using in kilograms, of only getting 50 grams of each. The other side shows the percent of food being wasted at consumer levels. Ths graph is trying to show that we are wasting food and that poultry and seafood farms are wasting and over producing.\n\nMy headline \"Crush the Crustaceans\"",

In other words 50 grams of protein produced from beef, will produce 17.7 kg of CO2, but 50 grams of protein from eggs, will produce 2.9 grams of protein. So it is almost 6 times better to eat eggs than beef in terms of environmental impact from greenhouse gases.  Does that make sense?  Be sure to return to see the reveal of the article tomorrow.",

    "comment info": "I believe that this graph is demonstrating how detrimental our waste can be. The two highest CO2 producing industries are beef and lamb, at 17.7 kg and 9.9 kg respectively. It just so happens that meat and poultry is the third most wasted commodity, at 21% wasted. This means that of that 17.7 kg it took to make just 50 g of protein, 3.717 kg are completely wasted. This may seem minimal when you look at just one 50 g portion of beef, but when you do the math, it really adds up. In 2016, the world consumed about 129.5 billion pounds of beef, and each pound is 117g of protein. When you multiply this and divide it by 50g (to get the amount of times 17.7 kg carbon is produced), and proceed to multiply that by 17.7 kg, it gives you the final answer of total kilograms of CO2 produced because of beef worldwide, and multiplying that by .21 gives the total amount wasted. And that answer is: 1.13 trillion kg of CO2 wasted from beef every year - and that's only beef! The same steps can be replicated to calculate the mass of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of any other source of protein, and the results will always be shocking. In all, this graph is showing, on a smaller scale, how drastic the effects of wasting certain foods are.",

We are constantly thinking about pollution and littering when breeding livestock and wasting foods contribute to the greenhouse effect as well. Our cows produce 37% of the methane in the world, which is the second most abundant greenhouse gas, after carbon dioxide. When America kills 39 million cattle a year, emissions add up. Your dinner starts to matter a whole lot more in the long run. But the problem is, people are not willing to give up their meat for fruits and vegetables, with 25 and 24% being wasted respectively.

    "comment info": "I wonder why the graphs are side by side, as these two graphs help Americans reduce their cognitive dissonance as they make unsustainable decisions about what to eat. We're all aware that we should cut meat out of our diet for the sake of the environment. However, when I see that I'm more likely to waste fruits and vegetables, I could justify my choice to not cut out meat by saying that buying alternatives for my diet would lead to more wastage, which is environmentally bad due to deadweight loss. \n\nThe two issues can be solved by changing the unit of the bar graph to the left. Instead of kilograms of carbon dioxide per 50 grams of protein, it should be equivalent kilograms of carbon dioxide per pound of food. Doing equivalent kilograms of carbon dioxide ensures that other emissions, such as methane, are accounted for. Just convert the damage done per gram of emitted methane to emitted gram of carbon dioxide. Listing the emissions per pound of food allows Americans to conceptualize just how harmful some of their dietary choices are for the environment. Additionally, doing quantity of food, as opposed to quantity of protein, means that Americans can also see just how efficient fruits and vegetables (in general, not niche products like beans and nuts) are to meat, so they have a harder time justifying their choices compared to the current graph.",

You may want to look above to the response by Ava Sauer of Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC.  She makes the calculations you suggest for beef and comes up with the total effect of the beef we eat on the environment.  If you made the comparable calculations for the other foods, you could then calculate the foods\u2019 efficiencies, as you describe above.  THAT would be very, very interesting.  How about some more in-depth research?\n\nAlso, you suggest that eating more fruits and vegetables would result in more waste.

While it doesn't exactly follow the law, many data points approach it. For example, first place beef has almost double the impact as second place lamb. fifth place pork is close to four fifths of fourth place cheese. This law doesn't seem to apply to the percentage of food lost. However, we can still see a similar trend in that the top few datapoints far exceed the rest of the data.

I noticed that the highest point from the CO2 is beef with 17.7, and it means that more factories make beef, and companies love beef so it has sales/releasing the most CO2. The lowest point was nuts with 0.1, because companies don't buy nuts for their resturants/brands, and it doesn't take much to make nuts. The highest point for wasted food was 31% with fish and seafood. This is probably because people waste more seafood due to not finishing the meal. Some resturants give you a huge dish of seafood, thus why it's wasted. The lowest point was grains with 19%. It means that grains aren't wasted as much as everything elese, because most resturants/customers dont throw it out. A caption for this article is that beef and seafood are big causes to the environment, but that's not all. A catchy title for this article is \"Cut out Meat, Veggies To Eat! (dont waste it!)\"",

By doing some simple math, you can see that the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted by the industries farming animals are almost 31 times the amount emitted from the nut, tofu, and bean industries combined. You can see that the percentages of food waste in each category are pretty close together with seafood as the highest contributor with 31% of total food from that category being wasted. This could be  because we are catching/farming and selling too much seafood for people to possibly be able to consume. I think that these two charts could possibly be representing how we manufacture too much food and it's taking a toll on the environment.",

I saw a graph similar to this one in 2017 and it changed the way I viewed our food consumption and waste system in the United States. Environmental consciousness is important to me, so after doing some research, I decided to try to cut back on beef products. \n\nThe graph shows the GHG emissions associated with certain foods that provide protein. Beans and nuts are at the bottom (least emissions), and beef and lamb at the top (most emissions). The graph reinforces the idea that plant based diets are more environmentally friendly than those including animal products. Within the last year, I have gradually gone completely vegan solely because of the environmental impacts of meat and animal products, as shown in the graph. \n\nHowever, I often have doubts about the true impact I\u2019m having with the diet. Just 10-20% of green house gas emissions actually come from agriculture/animal food industry, the rest from electricity/transportation/industry sources. So, even if every person on the planet went vegan, there would still be 80-90% of the original amount of fossil fuels being added to our atmosphere. \n\nThis graph brings up an incredibly controversial, yet important topic with many viewpoints.
