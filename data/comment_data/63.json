There are also no numbers involved in the graph: what is the healthcare system capacity, the times, the number of cases. With no data shown in the graph it poses a, while true, weak support for the idea of safety measures to support the healthcare system.",

Right now the hospitals in areas most affected are way beyond their limits, having to chose life or death for the other wise healthy 23 year old collage student. Also before the virus the healthcare system was already at it max in some places, so that even with protective measures some hospitals would be running out of supplies. If the government would see that their people are dying then maybe they would consider wearing masks in public outtings and use the protective measures they want us to follow.",

Those who took the safety precautions had extremely lower rates of COVID-19 as well as the time that it took for others to become infected was much shorter.\n\nI wonder if the graph also took into account the ages, medical history and the location of the people who were recorded and used for this data because these are variables that would provide better and more accurate results when kept constant.\n\nIn this graph we are seeing the rate of people who are becoming infected as well as how many, based on weather they take protective measures or not.

Instead of worrying about keeping the curve flat, I was creating hypothetical situations about what would happen if the healthcare system was exceeded. I also assumed that the graph was based off some data collected in the United States, while in reality it was all theoretical and only emphasizing the importance of \"flattening the curve.\" I understand that mitigation is so important in reducing the number of cases, but I have concern for the state of the economy after the virus is contained. By flattening the curve, we will see less cases and less deaths, but will the global economic repercussions be worth those lives. Now, I'm not saying the economy is more important than people's lives, but a moral dilemma arises: save a thousand lives from the virus, or potentially lose millions from the aftermath. \n\nThe reveal brought a perspective to my eyes about this graph. Instead of focusing on the y-axis, or the number of cases, I looked at the x-axis, or the time till the virus is gone. With proper mitigation and safety precautions taken, the curve can potentially stay below the healthcare capacity. This would be vital in our attempt to subdue the virus, even though the virus may exist longer.

My original opinion was that the second curve was based on pure mathematics and calculations, but after reading the reveal, I now see that it is way more theoretical than that. First, the idea that the second curve will not exceed the healthcare system's ability is not certain. The graph is theoretical, based on other pandemics and rational thought, but not a certain curve that our country will get if we use the protective measures. However, I agree and understand the curve and know that it is achievable with the introduction of the protective measures.\n\nAnother thing is that I knowingly went off topic in my previous comment. I talked more about the time being used and how that would also affect the country. While I still believe this is important, I think that I should have focused more on the amount of infections, our health care systems ability, and how the introduction of the protective measures will help our country. Our country, like many others, has many cases, but we weren't the first ones. We should be looking at other countries to see what they are doing that works. China is a prime example and has used protective measures and lock downs to slow the curve. We now know it can be slowed and should do all we can to follow as they did to ensure the most American's safety.",

With the introduction of protective measures the number of cases will not exceed what the healthcare system can handle, and while the process will be more slow, overall it is the best and safest way to protect our society during this crisis.\nLooking at this, I notice that this is just an idea of what could happen and it isn't set in stone which curve our country is going to take. However, based on all of the steps our country has made to limit social interaction, I think that we are bound to take the second curve. As long as the country stays  abides by what law enforcement has said, our curve will not exceed healthcare's line, and we will suffer many less deaths because of that. \nI also have to wonder, is there anything else that our country can be doing to ensure we have that curve? We have shut down almost everything in the country, put many places into lock down, and stopped almost all social interactions in areas that have the most risk. Overall, I think our country has done almost flawlessly, but it also leads me to think what consequences might come from choosing this curve instead of the other one? There will be less death, but the economy will be suffering longer with everyone in lockdown. This could put us into a big recession and ruin our economy.

While watching the news, this is the only question I have been asking myself, how long can this country truly last shut down like this? All this time, a slow economy, people not getting paid, and family's using government money to put food on the table, isn't a recipe for success.\nDonald Trump has received a lot of hate for trying to bring our country back to normal as soon as possible, while some of what he says is just unrealistic, like being back by Easter, I think the idea is right. This country needs to be moving again and as efficient as it was as soon as possible. The longer we wait, the harder it will be to recover. So if I were going to rename the graph, it would be, which curve is best for our country? Most will say the second easily, but the effects of both must be weighed first.",

Whilst the theory may be correct, that diminishing the number of cases at the start would assist our health care system in treating those who are critically ill, it also has a negative side effect to it.  The longer this virus is around, spreading, the longer the world is stopped.  The longer people are imprisoned at home.  The longer students are out of school.  The longer factories are stopped.  The longer the virus has to mutate.  The longer people are living off the government.  The longer we lose our rights. \n\nWhile flattening the curve may mitigate the number of deaths, it may kill the economy even more.  It's a toss up, save a few hundred million globally from dying, or save a few billion from losing everything.  Save a few thousand while 30 million lose the right to work, 70 million lose the  right to leave their home, and the country falls into a depression that may take five to ten years to recover from.

This surprised me because I though that the point of protective measures was only to spread the cases out, but I didn't realize that they can decrease the death rate by so much. It makes sense now because when health care workers are able to help all of the people who are infected at one time, people are not dying from a lack of medical supplies and resources.

However, after the reveal, I now realize that it is a theoretical mathematical model, created by specialists like Dr. Harris from the article. Looking back at the comments of others and the moderator, though, many people seemed to hold my prior thought: that the US was doing a very good job controlling the coronavirus. People thought we were already following the blue curve, when in fact it should be what we aspire to, not what we congratulate ourselves on achieving.\n         Looking at the article, \"flattening the curve\" becomes seemingly even more important. If the peak number of cases can be kept under the healthcare system's capacity, the outbreak is much more manageable. Looking at graphs of each country's cases, however, it is evident that the US will need to do more in order to get on track to follow the blue curve. The early numbers of cases in the US are such that numbers may rise high enough to meet the red curve, which could be catastrophic. A better job must be done distributing testing kits, quarantining those infected, and continuing social distancing. Some seem to think the outbreak is slowing, that it is okay to slacken social distancing. This is untrue. It is important as ever to continue social distancing to slow the spread of the virus, follow the blue curve, and avoid chaos.",

Multiple simulations have shown that even small day to day changes can have a measurable effect on the spread of the virus.

By comparing the spread of the virus in different countries, with the explanatory variable being government mandated interventions, it is clear that countries with aggressive systems in place in order to fight the disease experience a far slower spread of the virus.

I still wonder how the decrease in the infection spread rate makes the epidemic last longer. If there were no protective measures followed, the epidemic would pass over in a quicker time span.

Flattening the curve is obviously something that needs to happen to protect the world, but the data from the graph is not from an actual situation and instead from a prediction. \n\nFlattening the curve, whether it keeps us under the healthcare threshold or not, is still important because it gives the most people the highest chance of survival. Sure, the virus will occur for longer because it won't burn through patients as fast, but it will ensure that our healthcare systems are not completely overwhelmed with the number of patients. If we let everyone get infected, we would have to fight the disease without any hospital help and simply rely on our immune systems, which is very dangerous. \n\nBased on the simulation, it is definitely still necessary to practice social distancing and even possibly lead into forced quarantine.

This is the curve without. Then we look towards the axes and we see \"# of Cases\" over \"Time\".\n In other words, it's a mathematical model- a prediction, an assumption- of what might happen in 2 different pandemic scenarios. One where we're lenient. One where we're active.\n It was neat reading about the origins of this model, and I enjoyed getting to know a bit more about what it meant and who it came from, but it all feels so unnecessary to me. This graph is extremely thorough, quite frankly, and I really felt that no explanation was needed.\n The graph just screams: \"stay at home so our healthcare system doesn't overflow with patients!\"",

They also discuss the fact that there is a graph showing the number of new cases in countries with over fifty confirmed cases.

The model predicts that, if there are proactive interventions, the number of cases in any time period will be less likely to exceed the health care capacity system.\u201d This tells us that again, like I said, we need to take these proactive measures and take care of ourselves and others!

I initially thought that this was a graph that mathematical model that had the x and y axes removed for the sake of allowing us to guess what the real numbers were. However, I now understand that this is more of a theoretical model based on past experiences than it is a statistical model. Another part of this article that caught my eye is how much variation there is to this model depending on many different factors, such as age distribution, fatality rate, and replication rate. Even with how much of our attention is dedicated to this virus right now, we have very little idea of what the overall death total will look like or a solid prediction of what this virus may do.",

The model does not display numerical values, instead it shows the predicted distribution of what the trend of taking protective measures  would be compared to if those measures were not completed. This graph was published in hopes to influence the behavior of people who are unaware of the current ramifications of not taking preventative measures. The mathematical model anticipates that with some intervention the death rate has the possibility of being cut in half. Even though the span of the virus appears to be longer with protective measures it is important to not overwhelm the healthcare system, so people diagnosed can have the necessary treatment. Overall, this will reduce the death toll. The peak is prodigious when social distancing is not accomplished, so it is important to flatten the curve. It may seem harmless to break the codes of social distancing every once and a while, but those rules should not be broken, or taken lightly, because social distancing will help save a plethora of lives. \n In Stat Nuggets, the passage explains how this data was based on prior epidemics. I found that extremely intriguing. The mathematical model is created to predict the future characteristics of a real world problem in terms of both  qualitative and quantitative data.Does this model mirror the past epidemics, or where are there differences within the predictions?The model furthers the idea that safety is key.",

The comments from the moderators have opened up my eyes to the fact that this model was based on prior epidemics, and is still in question whether as to how much interventions could cut down the death rate of the virus. I see also that this is a model constructed in a way to see how the U.S. can reduce the curve on the spread of the virus in order to properly help our Healthcare System keep up and address the number of cases already presented. Though it may have an effect on our country's resources, I believe that having a longer time of quarantine will help prevent the spread of the virus, and let the Healthcare System take care of the current cases.",

The reason I think the quarantine graph is not symmetrical is because the quarantine essentially creates two separate graphs, one of initial infection, then a second outbreak after quarantine. Naturally, the first outbreak is small and is easily brought down. However, when the second outbreak occurs, it hits harder, producing a curve much larger than the previous one, hence why as a whole it is asymmetrical in nature. The amount of intervention I support would be high levels of social distancing, which calls for only 1 in 8 people traveling and greatly reducing the infection rate while greatly increasing the recovery rate.",

Of course, it is a known fact that often times when there is a precaution taken to ensure something, the result is what we desired, in this case, to stop the cases of Coronavirus. I saw how drastically the curve changed from it going from a high curve to a flattened out curve. And through this graph one can obviously guess that when people are keeping a social distance or maintaing the quarantine rule then there will be less number of cases.\n\nI wonder however that if we were to completely restrict everything strictly, would that result in an extreme and sudden drop in cases or is this something that has to happen gradually regardless of how sudden and strict precaution you take.\n\n \"The only time a Flatline is what we need.\" or \"Keep it safe to Keep it Low.\" Basically the graphs are showing how people need to follow the mandate of keeping social distance and to take all safety precautions to make sure our curve is more flattened.\n\nI think the original article and the moderator's comments really help open up people's eyes as to how bad and crazy this could get quickly. We see the line that indicates the capacity that the healthcare services can provide services until they themselves can't help people anymore.

The concept of flattening the curve is a theoretical diagram made from analyzing previous epidemics. The reason social distancing is so important is to slow and reduce the spread of COVID-19, which therefore causes less people to be sick at a time.

Some people may just see two simple opposing curves where one breaks through a line and one does not.

Right now, the cancelling of schools, flights, and public gatherings is helping to keep the curve flat and allow for hospitals to be better prepared so that as a country we don't exceed our healthcare system's capacity. Although it may seem pointless now, staying home and keeping your distance from others is not just saving the lives of people who may die, but is also helping everyone who is affected by this quickly spreading virus.",

We\u2019ve so far had 3 people die, one a day for the last three days. I can\u2019t help but wonder how this could be much worse if we hadn\u2019t taken any action and how this can be kept to the bare minimum if we stick to our social-distancing.

I believed it showed how practicing social distancing and good hygiene can save the lives of others.  The graph encouraged me to stay away from large crowds and to wash my hands constantly.  Due to Covid-19 being in the United States for such a short period of time, I predicted that the graph was only based on mathematical predictions.  There has not been enough data gathered to prove the validity of the graph and that is why there are no numbers and statistical increments on the graph.  \n\nThe \u201cReveal\u201d, published on the 26th of March, backed up my previous claims.  The graph is simply a mathematical model based on data from previous epidemics.  It should be used to gain qualitative and/or quantitative understanding and not be taken entirely literally by the public.  Scientists use these hypothetical graphs to keep the public informed and to encourage them to practice the suggested protective measures.  It represents the impact Covid-19 will have in America if we don\u2019t follow protective measures versus if we do.  The graph shows how valuable interventions are when fighting a virus.  Interventions like drive-through testing, cancellation of public gatherings, school closings, and preparation of hospitals greatly slow the spread of Covid-19.

It can be really frustrating being separated from the people you love for so long, stuck in your house, but it\u2019s worth it. The article predicts that even with moderate interventions, the death rate can be cut in half; imagine how many lives can be saved if we take more extreme measures! If we restrict interaction to the very minimum, we\u2019re less likely to come into contact with infected people and/or items; the illness will be contained, or the spread will at least not be quite so rampant. And no matter how much interaction we have, it is vital that we be very meticulous with our hygiene. Hand-washing, while simple, goes a long way.

The goal, of course, is to flatten the curve with the least possible deaths while, also, staying under the healthcare capacity line. The article provides a fairly simple solution to making sure that we reach our goal, and that is, social distancing. New York, or more specifically, New York City, is a fair representation of the red curve, and in order to mitigate it into the more reasonable blue curve, we need to take some precautionary measures. With social distancing, there will be less people packed in one place which will ultimately slow down the spread of the disease. There will not be so much as a surge of cases that overload hospitals, so we will be able to control and handle the virus much better which means less deaths. To explain the idea more clearly, the article compares it to a subway car during rush hour. The subway car is the hospital, and it can only take so many \u201cpatients\u201d at a time, so the rest have to wait at the platform. By staggering work hours (practicing social distancing), the rush hour will be less of a rush since less people are in need of the subway car at one time, so people are more likely to be able to get on the car and have a comfortable ride.",

The article says that the best thing we can do is to close schools, end public gatherings, and make tests more available but we have done that and the virus is still spreading rapidly. Schools across the country are shut down, many for the remainder of the year, and over one-fifth of Americans are under mandatory shelter in place orders. What more can we do to stop the virus?\nMathematically, the virus is still spreading at an exponential rate globally and in the US. When an exponential graph is converted to a logistic model, it typically looks like a straight line. If the line has a positive slope, it is still increasing at an exponential rate. In the US, we are still going up at a positive slope on the logistic model. We haven't even hit the inflection point yet where the virus begins to slow. This mathematical fact makes me question what is going to happen to the country. Are we all going to end up like New York? Are the worst case scenarios of 2/3 of the nation being infected going to play out? All of the data being thrown our way truly scares me and makes me question what we are doing wrong. \nThe analogy of the subway in the article was very helpful for my understanding of the model. We as Americans need to listen to our leaders and stay home because if we do not, our \"subway\" is going to overflow and we will not have enough supplies for everyone.",

The article about which countries have flattened the curve shows how countries like China and South Korea used strict interventions and regulations to slow down or prevent the spread of the virus. Although the graph shows how the curve could stay below healthcare capacity through protective measures, those measures need to be strict and followed by everyone or else the healthcare system will still be overwhelmed like it is now.\n\nThrough this theoretical graph based on past data from earlier epidemics, it shows the future of COVID-19 based on our decisions. Although some stores have implemented safety measures for their customers, people who don\u2019t believe in the severity of this pandemic are still holding intimate gatherings of people with slides filled with germs. \n\nSocial distancing itself will not necessarily flatten the curve in the theoretical graph. What is needed is the consciousness of society to be proactive and realize that the parties that they are having may not affect them, but it will be a factor in hindering the progress of healthcare workers and flattening the curve.\n\nTo those who want to stay home when they have to work or go to school and aren\u2019t staying home when they are finally told to, please be mindful of all the other people who are working night and day to battle this virus.

    "comment info": "(Part 2)\nIn North Carolina our governor, Roy Cooper issued school closure until mid May as well as encouraging social distancing and limiting the amount of exposure to large groups of people, challenging the daily lives of Americans. Studies show that using social distancing techniques will decrease the spread of the virus, putting less people at risk. Which may lengthen the amount of time we are exposed to the virus but will keep the number of cases lower never over crowding our hospitals. This is a wise decision because even though some might not take all of the same precautions the sick and recovered will eventually even out.  \n\nSo I advise everyone to please not ignore the social distancing recommendations. Keeping a safe distance will help stop the spread and allow others to recover and we can be out on the beach before summer.",

    "comment info": "The reveal clarified the purpose of the model to show what will happen if the population takes protective measures.   Instead of displaying numerical values, the model was published to encourage change in our current behaviors to prevent the escalation of calamity.  Implementing protective measures will delay the peak of the coronavirus outbreak.  As a result, the number of cases at a given time will decrease and the length of the epidemic will increase.  Although the duration will increase, a much greater proportion of patients with coronavirus will be able to get adequate care, reducing the number of deaths.  In other words, increasing the duration of the outbreak will ensure that all patients have access to medical care, and the hospitals are adequately equipped with professionals and materials.  \n\nIt was also intriguing to learn about how this theoretical mathematical model is developed.  When statisticians and scientists use observations from prior epidemics, I wonder how they choose which epidemics to compare the coronavirus pandemic to.  Furthermore, I wonder if this \"Flatten the Curve\" model, or a similar one, has been developed for past epidemics.",

Every day while watching the news with my parents, I hear the Governor of New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, begging the U.S. government and private investors to send more medical supplies to New York State, specifically to New York City.  They were not prepared for the COVID-19 outbreak and it hit them the hardest.  As of March 26, there have been 37, 258 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in New York State, and 385 of those people have died.  Doctors and hospitals are so overwhelmed that they are calling for retired doctors and senior medical school students to come and help them.  And because of that, large numbers of people are dying in NY State.  \nIn my county in North Carolina, there are only 4 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and no deaths so far.  Why?  Because people - for the most part - listened to Governor Cooper.  Practice social distancing, no gatherings of more than 10 people, schools are canceled until May 15, and other precautionary measures have been put into place.  Governor Cooper canceled schools in North Carolina almost a week before Governor Cuomo canceled schools in New York.  And because of that and the other precautions we are taking, we have 4 confirmed cases of the Coronavirus and no deaths.",

The dotted line shows how if we do not take protective measure seriously that the number of coronavirus cases will overload the healthcare system and we will be unable to combat the illness effectively and efficiently. Without protective measures this will pose a huge problem not only in fighting the virus but for other illnesses as the healthcare system will be in overdrive and unable to accommodate everyone. This graph concerns me as people around America, particularly younger people, are not taking the CDC's advise of social distancing, specifically because they feel they are not at risk.

But I also noticed, if we don't use protective measures the virus is expected to take less time than if we use protective measures. Even though avoiding protective measures takes less time, it would be worse than using protective measures because it would include many deaths. There would be more deaths because the healthcare system capacity cannot take care of everyone at once, and healthcare workers would have to decide who they have to fight for. But, if we used protective measures, more people would have a chance of living. I wonder where the United States is on this graph. I feel like the US is somewhere in between, but it mostly depends on where you live.

This is very important because the healthcare system cannot function with so many people becoming sick.

Like me, many have faced alterations in day-to-day routines since the coronavirus outbreak. This is because social distancing measures decrease the rate at which COVID-19, what the CDC deems a global pandemic, proliferates, as reflected in the figure at right. \n\nThe two curves shown depict the relative number of infected individuals with and without protective measures like community isolation. Not only does the overall number of cases decrease tremendously with protective measures, but the peak amount matches the carrying capacity of the health care system. In this way, significantly fewer people will be affected when we self-isolate, as shown in blue, and all of those who do become infected can be treated. In the instance that social distancing and other protective measures do not transpire, however, the avoidable illness will plague thousands more, and there will be a lack of resources to help all those who need aid. I wonder how health care providers will choose which people receive treatment and which do not should this be the case. \n\nWe must unite as a global community to slow the virus\u2019 spread, protecting those more susceptible to the illness and making hospital space for affected individuals. Stay put & stay positive :)",

There's a noticeable spike of the number of cases that arose without protective measures, a number which was unsustainable for out current system.

Yes we have taken preventive measures, but even so there was a time when we almost surpassed the limit. \nThe problem may be dying out now in some areas but that does not make it any more safe. It's barely enough to sustain our healthcare system with preventative measure, so to go against the advice of all health experts and professionals, thinking that everything will be fine is an unjustified belief, because all the facts state otherwise.\nI do wonder how many people would have seen the red curve and thought \"it's worth it\" How many people would have seen that the number of cases dies out faster and risk destabilizing the system for the sake of not taking preventative measures. I wonder if the number of cases goes down because it rose to the point where no one could get sick anymore because everyone was infected, or maybe those who had been infected died out so the number of cases decreased. \nI came up with a name for this graph pretty quickly form the first thing I noticed. \"Barely Enough\" it's barely enough to keep our healthcare system stable.",

No protection will usually end up with someone being hurt. That is why social distancing is important. I think your question of the graph maybe changing based on location is interesting. The first thing I think of is rural communities which usually don't have much contact with other people. They probably won't have big hospitals either. Since viruses are likely to spread in big cities because of large amounts of human contact, more rural areas will be safer and probably don't have to take large protective measures.

There was a very high average number of people diagnosed with the Coronavirus in a short period of time when we didn\u2019t take protective measures like washing our hands and social distancing ourselves which resulted in overcrowding at hospitals. Now that people know to social distance themselves, the blue curve with wide standard deviation shows that people are listening to the authorities and implementing protective measures to keep themselves safe and how this helped bring down overcrowding at healthcare facilities. \n\nWhat healthcare officials are trying to do is bring down the red curve in a way that doesn\u2019t put the lives of those already infected at risk. We\u2019re trying to gradually bring down the red curve to merge with the blue curve, not run around throwing doctors in every possible direction to strangle the disease out.

The graph shows a steep incline after the first case, at its peak, it begins to level out showing that the peak infection time is over, exceeding the healthcare capacity by a large margin. On the flip side of this, the pandemic runs its course and dies out much more quickly. Still, the hospitals have been overrun with cases and there will be many casualties to come.\n         On the other hand, when certain precautions have been taken the course takes longer but does not result in as many casualties. I wonder though, if we are taking only some preventative measures it would be somewhere around the middle of the two, meaning the hospitals will still be overrun but with not as many casualties due to priorities of who would get help or not, correct? if so why do so many people still not worry about this highly infectious disease?\n         About quarantine though, I think that it will help in more ways than one because people are staying home and practicing social distancing, fewer people are at risk. also since fewer people are traveling carbon emissions have most likely been cut by a large portion.

The first thing I noticed when I looked at it is the drastic difference between the number of cases with and without protective measures. Even doing the simplest things like self quarantining in our homes can make a huge difference on the impact this virus will have on us and the amount of deaths it will cause. \n\nWhen I first looked at this graph, I wondered why we would want to prolong this disease when we could just get it over with and everyone could go back to their normal lives. But after thinking about it, I realized it was more important to make sure that we save as many people as possible and don\u2019t overwhelm our medical workers. Flattening the curve may not be the most convenient for most people, but it is better than the alternative where many people die because we did not have the resources to help everyone.  \n\nI wonder how accurate this graph is, and if it\u2019s still possible for us to flatten the curve that much.

Therefore we are basing our fate off of one point, while the rest is out of our control.\n\nMainly this graph shows two realities. One predicts what will happen if no cautionary  measures are properly followed, while the other shows what would happen if we were to do the right thing.\n\nAlthough I wonder what the right thing or answer truly is, because if we were to follow the first than it shows it would be over much sooner.

However, if we take protective measures such as social distancing, we won't be able to entirely stop the spread of illness, but we'll be able to slow it down enough so that our healthcare system won't be overwhelmed. Clearly, the graph shows that with protective measures, we'll be dealing with this virus for a longer period of time, but I believe that if we spread out the number of cases over more time, there will be fewer deaths and better care.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t know and wonder about is how this will affect our country and world in other ways, especially economically.

Although it takes longer for the number of cases to get to a bare minimum when we social distance, it can be seen that the total number of cases without social distance increases dramatically.\nOur government is making tremendous steps to help stop the spread of COVID-19, and I seriously applaud them for the work they are doing. It may take months, but it is better than letting the pandemic wipe out our entire society. I am also proud of the way us Americans are treating this virus. Many of my friends have gone into self-quarantine or are socially distancing themselves. It is remarkable how we have responded. In the end, I hope COVID-19 will be a reminder of how we need to be grateful for everything in life, because it can all be taken from us just like that. If I were to give this graph a headline, it would be, \"Flatten the Curve-Be Cool and Don't Be a Fool: Stay Inside\".",

Without protective measures (self-quarantine, basic hygiene, etc.) the curve is much higher than our healthcare system can handle; this implies hospitals are overpacked, not prepared to take care of that many cases, or lack of medical supplies. However when protective measures are taken and people abide by the \"stay at home\" rule, the curve flattens and it becomes within the healthcare systems capability. It is also interesting to see the point in time at which the \"without protective measures becomes the \"with protective measures.\" (the increase starts to decrease).",

However, I think the curve may start to have a negative second derivative even before the intersection.

Without social distancing and sanitation, the virus would spread like wildfire, jumping from person to person at incredible rates. With protective measures, however, less people would get infected from this novel Coronavirus. The amount of cases would stay within the health system\u2019s capacity, and countries like Italy would not be running out of respirators. I\u2019ve been doing research into COVID-19 since it was still in Wuhan, and as I\u2019ve seen, lack of protective measures are what caused this pandemic. The Chinese Propaganda Machine tried to keep it under wraps, instead of helping their people fight this new pathogen. It spread to other countries in Asia, and then to European countries. It is interesting to see how different handlings of the virus have caused different outcomes. South Korea pioneered the \u2018drive through testing\u2019 and gave updates on the virus every day, while Italy didn\u2019t do enough until it was too late. Just recently, an Italian mayor said they will start deploying police to enforce the lockdown- with flamethrowers. This is because Italians don\u2019t listen (trust me on this one, I\u2019m Italian). The scary thing is, Americans don\u2019t listen either. Florida beaches such as Clearwater were filled with young people who are unafraid. Hate to tell you, but here in the US, young people currently have higher rates of infection. If we don\u2019t practice social distancing, we\u2019ll end up like Italy.",

If we social distance, the amount of people that are infected with the virus at any given time will fall, reducing the demand for medical supplies and vital machinery like ventilators. When people do not socially distance, the infected expose many more people, infecting them and so on. The number of infections increases exponentially, overwhelming the healthcare system. The virus then burns itself out, but not before thousands would be dead from a lack of medical care resources. If social distancing is implemented, the infection rate will slow, making the virus take longer to burn itself out but decreasing the number of cases at any given time. \nThe government can only do so much for us. Many complain that the government is not doing enough to help Americans and in some cases that is true. No one should be evicted because they can't go to work because of the virus.

There are pros and cons to both that are pretty well established by the graph. If we let it run its course, then we can get back to our normal lives much sooner, but that means that our healthcare system will not be able to manage the virus and the higher number of infected people as well, so more deaths are likely to occur. On the other hand, our economy will take a heavy blow due to the shut downs lasting a lot longer, but our healthcare system will be able to manage, so less people will die, and we would be a lot safer and in better hands if we were to get it since there are much less cases. Either way, there is much to think about, and not a lot of time to think.

Is this after a cure or vaccine is created, or is it after all of the infected people have either died or recovered? If we let it run its course then the Healthcare system will take a heavy blow, but the Stock Market might be able to make a rebound much sooner, which could possibly lead to the Healthcare system also might make a stable recovery. If we keep it under control, and make it last longer than the US will be drained significantly of resources that were used in keeping the spread under control while also treating the cases.

Healthcare system capacity is driven by number of hospital beds and materials needed to treat patients as well as the number of healthcare professionals available. It seems unclear where we are on this curve for the US, my particular state of North Carolina, or even for my local hospital, which only has about 700 beds for a population of 300,000 people.  \n\nIf we are early in the curve, do we still have time to act by increasing restrictions on every day life or by adjusting our healthcare system by adding new beds in hotels or dorms?

Wouldn't the number of cases keep going up, since the virus is spreading, because of the absence of protective measures? I would think it would keep going up in number of cases.

The \"Without Protective Measures\" is in red to draw attention to a potential negative, while the \"With Protective Measures\" curve is in blue to indicate a potential positive possibility. The next thing I notice is that the \"With Protective Measures\" curve barely manages to make its way under the Healthcare system capacity. One of the first things that I wondered upon seeing this graph is if it is exaggerated or not. Is the situation as dire as is represented on this graph and if we take protective measures, will we still just barely remain under healthcare system capacity?

If we look at the situation in New York, their medical capabilities have already been overrun with coronavirus patients and they are having to choose who gets a ventilator and who does not. Essentially, the doctors have the power of who lives and who dies in their hands and there is nothing they can do to save everyone. \nThe takeaway that I get from this graph as well as what is happening in New York is that the American people must save themselves. There is only so much our government can do. We need to buckle down, take this seriously, and stay home.

That's a very interesting point in the colors of the two different curves representing positivity(blue) vs negativity(red). I definitely agree on which is which, though. The red one dies out faster, but the number of cases shoot well past a manageable amount which points to a high number of deaths. Is it worth it to keep the business going and the economy a little more stable? I don't think so. You can't run a business if you're dead. Instead, we should lean towards the blue curve. Less cases, less death, and way more safe. We shouldn't be overloading our hospitals to the point they are overworking staff, running out of supplies, and out of room. That's not good for anybody. In my opinion, we should stay home, let it die in a safe way, and just realize that it'll be over later, and we can start getting back to our normal schedules which includes pumping the economy back up.",

If protective measures are used, it is projected that even the peak number of cases will be below the healthcare system capacity. However, if protective measures are not used, the amount of cases will greatly surpass the healthcare system capacity. This graph seems very similar to what has already happened in some countries.\n        In some countries, the prediction relayed by the graph has already taken place. For example, in Italy, protective measures were not used in the widespread manner they should have been used. As a result, hospitals have been overwhelmed. Medical supplies have run short, and heart-wrenching decisions like who will get a life-saving respirator have had to be made. This is the situation that people in the United States are trying to avoid through social distancing. It is predicted that by doing what the United States has done, by using social distancing, peak cases will never exceed the healthcare system's capacity. This has worked thus far, as the capacity of the healthcare system has not been exceeded yet. Even though capacity has not been exceeded, the outbreak is still extremely bad. This leads me to wonder how bad the pandemic would be in the US if protective measures were not put in place.",

This graph shows us how the number of cases for without protective measures have affected lots of people and not a lot of people can get enough as the people with protective measures getting less than enough people for capacity for a Healthcare system.  This is shown on the graph and the people who weren't careful can't get as much help as others when the Healthcare system is already full, leading for some of the people to die from this virus. Also this pandemic virus can't spread when we had protective measures. I mean sure we could go outside, but if we have just a little bit of human contact with strangers, we might have a chance of having it. That's why the graph for with protective measures has a little increase on it because some don't care about it or it maybe just been an accident when you went outside and had some human contact. I wonder if this would ever increase if we all just stayed home and relaxed or maybe run up and down the stairs or do pacers inside the house. If we all did that we would be athletically healthy.

    "comment info": "Obviously the first thing I notice about the graph is how the number of cases over time since the first case is drastically impacted by whether there are protective measures in place or not. The reason the Red graph is so high is that more and more people are contracting the coronavirus as there are no safety precautions in place, and once it hits the capacity of the healthcare system it will only be able to build more rapidly, as people become more sick, but yet the Healthcare system can\u2019t keep up. But I wonder how the number of cases just drops so suddenly after a certain period of time. Could this be after finding a cure or some kind of vaccine for the virus. I\u2019m just curious as to how it will drop so suddenly. But the graph with protective measures solely depends on if everyone is actually following the safety precautions. I wonder that if we do not use safety precautions then the amount of time the Coronavirus is around will drop instead of dragging it out with safety precautions.

I believe that is when the Coronavirus was labeled as a global pandemic and protective measures were put into place.\n\nI wonder if this graph is up to date or if it is showing data for one country or the entire world. I also wonder if we were more prepared would the Coronavirus be as strong as it is now. Too the point that it is destroying the world's economy, closing educational facilities, and raising the unemployment rate to the highest it's been in years. I believe that we will recover from this pandemic and that next time something like this happens again Protective measures will be put into place as soon as possible to avoid another worldwide pandemic.",

The line represents how many patients and cases the healthcare system is able to treat at any given time.  \n\nIt can be seen in the graph, that if no protective measures are taken against preventing the spread of COVID-19 the amount of time which COVID-19 will persist may be shorter, but there will be a much larger amount of cases during its peak, and with such an influx of cases at a given time, there won't be enough medical support to properly treat many of those cases, and leading to many more deaths.  \n\nOn the other hand, if protective measures are thoroughly being implemented, the spread of COVID-19 will still occur, but it will happen at a much slower and smaller rate.  Meaning it would persist for longer, but those cases will all be able to get the medical attention they need, and many more people would be able to survive.

It's only hurting us.\" I can understand how that misconception is common, as it appears that taking protective measures elongates the lifetime of the virus, but if you look closer, the longer the virus is around, the more victims our healthcare system can treat.\n\nUpon examination of this graph, it is evident that without protective measures, our healthcare system will be grossly overwhelmed. For teenagers, this virus isn't very lethal. However, just because it isn't lethal, doesn't mean that you won't need medical attention if you do contract it. The other day, one of my friends talked about catching Coronavirus just to \"get it over with.\" As nice as this may sound for teens, it can be deadly for society. Even if COVID-19 doesn't kill you, just a little bit of fluid in your lungs can warrant hospitalization. If you, an unsympathetic teen, is taking up resources in a hospital, you are denying those services to someone who is at risk of dying from this virus.\n\nSo, stay home. Don't go out with your friends, to the grocery store, or expose yourself to anyone else unless you have to. I know, social distancing sucks, but you're doing it to protect the people and healthcare officials in your town. If this graph tells us anything, it isn't that social distancing is hurting us, but that it MUST happen if we want to overcome this virus with as little casualties as possible.",

All we are doing is putting ourselves and others at more risk to catch the virus and give it to the ones we love when we go back home.

With protective measures, even though it will last a little bit longer than without protective measures, it stays below what the healthcare system can handle, which means less casualties. I say we are somewhere in the middle of both estimated sets of data because although we are making sure we have the right equipment to fight off diseases, we are still going outside of our houses to do so, which means we are still touching things that others have touch and who knows if that person sneezed or coughed all over their hands before touching objects that others have to touch. I work at Harris Teeter so all I see is people, some with no protection on them, walking around touching things and putting them back, others have face masks and gloves on, smart.

Regardless of what we may have at risk, I don\u2019t think that allowing everybody to contract the virus and \u201cget it over with\u201d as some people may see it is an option. If we look at the graph closer, we can see that the dotted line representing our health system\u2019s capacity has been overcome vastly with no social distancing and other practices in place.

The hospital in our town has already started asking for personal protective equipment donations, meaning they are already stating to feel the pressure from this virus. Healthcare professionals risk their neighbors', families', and their own lives by going to work everyday. The work and care that they are putting in to stop this virus is tremendous.

I have heard on the news many times about countries like China and Italy having to turn away patients because of the number of people that have the virus. This is really concerning, but I think it is important to hear, the same thing could happen in our country if we are not careful. Now is the time to use protective measures to flatten the curve and make sure our healthcare system is able to provide for everyone that needs to be provided for.\n\nI also find it interesting and surprising that with protective measures the virus will actually last longer than if no protective measures are taken. I find this really odd, I would think that protective measures would both lower the number of cases and the amount of time it is around for. I am very interested to see why this is when the reveal for the graph comes out.\n\n I wonder if people will participate in social distancing after seeing this. Although social distancing is not fun it really is necessary in lowering the amount of people getting the virus. I also wonder what other protective measures we can use to flatten the curve, the only one that I have consistently heard is social distancing but if there are other ways to slow the spread I would be interested in hearing them. \n\nI think a good headliner would be, \u2018We can flatten the curve.\u2019",

However, if the curve is flattened and elongated, certain people will be contracting the virus at later times than others, which means that healthcare workers can treat one wave of people and then treat the next wave of people without being overwhelmed. Imagine that there are four groups of people and that each group gets the virus one at a time. The hospital will be able to treat the group that is initially sick, ensure that they are all healthy, and then be prepared to treat the next group that gets sick. This would take roughly four times as long as compared to everyone getting sick and rushing to the hospital at once, which explains why the curve for preventative measures is longer.",

One curve looks at the growth of the virus without taking protective measures, and the other with taking protective measures. It seems from the data that the cases will fall back to zero faster without taking protective measures, but the healthcare system capacity will be exceeded. By using protective measures, it will take longer for the cases to fall to zero, but we will not exceed the healthcare capacity.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that this data is all theoretical. Whoever compiled it can\u2019t measure how the number of cases will change when the healthcare capacity is exceeded. The data seems to suggest there won\u2019t be any changes to the curve after the capacity is exceeded. I wonder with the almost exponential growth of the virus, in addition to the healthcare capacity being exceeded, what that would be like on any scale. The data suggests that eventually the cases will go back down, but I truly wonder, would they? If we have no ability to contain the virus, who is to say the number of cases won\u2019t stop going up? I fear that our healthcare system does not have the ability to handle such a vast number of cases, and if it does collapse, we would be in a crisis that the world has never seen before. The scientific community unanimously agrees that the priority has to be containment. Not doing so could be deadly. A fitting title could be: \u201cHealthcare System Capacity Exceeded.

And as this graph and research proves, the number one method for doing so is to practice social distancing. At first glance at the graph shown, I see that if we don't, as a whole society, stay home and socially distance ourselves from others, the number of cases will only continue to rise and hospitals will run out of the needed room and tools to treat people. Every human being must be more aware than ever now that their decisions really do affect others in a life or death manner. \n\nI applaud the countless healthcare workers out there risking their lives in hospitals, and as the graph shows, we can do our part to help them by staying home so that they don't have to worry about running out of treatment options and beds for sick people. There are many other ways to stay in contact and remain connected with people who you care about virtually. That being said, I don't think distancing ourselves from other people should be referred to as social distancing in every case. Rather, it could just be called distancing. \n\nWithout protective measures, the graph proves that the amount of people diagnosed with COVID-19 will keep rising significantly. In order to stop that, each individual must do their part to stay healthy and safe. This means washing your hands, sanitizing objects that you use frequently, and keeping your distance from people to flatten the curve.",

How would our Healthcare system deal with those who contract the Covid-19 virus once our Healthcare system has already reached the maximum amount of patients that they can treat safely?

Due to the unsuspected rapid increase of Covid-19 cases in Italy, they were not prepared for the effects of the virus.  The Italian hospitals do not have near enough resources to cure patients and thousands have died due to the sheer lack of resources.  They do not have an adequate amount of ventilators to keep patients alive and they have to choose which patient will live and which will die.  It is truly awful.  \n\nThree days ago 512 italians died due to Covid-19.  Just two days ago, over 700 Italians died from Covid-19.  That number is still increasing as 743 died yesterday.

This limit requires protective measures to be taken during a disease so all patients can be cared for. However, without protective measures, there is a large spike that goes well beyond healthcare capacity. What is curious about this graph is that without protective measures, the disease decreases rapidly compared to with protective measures. Where the disease ends for the red portion is where there is a small spike with protective measures. This reminds me that the potential for everyone to get the disease is much more prolonged under quarantine. Based on the graph, it seems like the same amount of people could get infected either way. Yet what can be controlled here is how many can get treatment. I wonder what the graph would look like if it showed casualties in both situations. There would likely be far less with protective measures than without, showing that despite the people infected remaining inevitably the same, it is important that measures are taken so that hospitals are not overflowed. Does this mean our country is not prepared in terms of healthcare? If, in a perfect scenario, we had very expansive tools and space within hospitals, could protective measures not need to be taken? \n\nSocietal Measures Must Be Taken to Sustain Hospital Capacity in the Event of a Disease",

While there is a difference in the number of cases regarding the use of protective measures and without, I wouldn\u2019t say it is drastic. It\u2019s up to us whether or not you use protective measures, but in reality, how much does it really help?\n\nI wonder if it\u2019s even worth it to take the time to take these protective measures. For all I know, I could have it right now. Of course, most of the time the answer would immediately be yes, take the time to use protection because you never know. I believe that some people would debate this though. At the end of the day, everybody has their own decision and it\u2019s up to them.",

It shows how important it is to obey the government's protective measures and procedures they are communicating to the people of the United States.  I infer this by understanding the graph's labels.  If we do not follow protective measures, the number of patients with Covid-19 will exceed the capacity of our nation's Healthcare system.  However, by obeying the protective measures communicated to us, our Healthcare system will be able to sustain itself and not become overwhelmed by patients who test positive for Covid-19.  According to this graph, avoiding protective measures will mean that the number Covid-19 cases will decrease quickly and the virus will not be around as long if we do follow protective measures.  I infer this will be because there will be many more deaths due to the limited amount of patients our Healthcare system can support.  These deaths will be attributed to the lack of ventilators and hospital staff available to treat them.\n\nI wonder how long it is until the Coronavirus is eradicated from the United States and ultimately the world.  It is said that a cure for the virus could take over a year to develop.  I wish there were labels on the graph that estimated how long it could potentially be until the virus is gone.",

Considering how fast this virus is shown to spread, I would believe that we all already have it and are just asymptomatic. All of these protective measures are mostly being taken because we don't know much about this disease yet and it's new to us. If someone in a small town, like mine, tests positive, chances are everyone already has it and just doesn't know. When you live in a small town, you're constantly talking to other people and exchanging their air or shaking their hands. People have tested positive in every state of the US.

These protective measures most likely consist of practicing social distancing and washing your hands frequently. It is shown in the graph that practicing these methods will result in higher amounts of recovered, healthy patients. Without these measures, the curve is significantly larger, exceeding the healthcare system's capacity. A consequence of this will be more deaths of sick patients due to less medical supplies and overworked staff. In order to maintain steady and high percentages of recovered patients, the curve must remain below the healthcare capacity. \n\n2.) I wonder does every single person in the country have to follow this in order to see the \"protective measures\" results? Or what exactly is the health care capacity, does it differ around the country?\n\n3.) \"Why Does It Matter If I Stay Home Or Go Out If I'm Not Sick?\" or \"How Washing Your Hands Can Help Nurses and Doctors Nationwide.\"",

In the graph I noticed that the number of Corona virus cases reached it peak towards the beginning of the outbreak and as precautions started to be enforced, the number of cases has significantly declined. Without the necessary precautions, the number of cases will only go up and significantly increase. If we follow the necessary precautions and stay inside and quarantine properly, then we can probably get the number of corona virus cases down and lower the virus.\n2.) I wonder what the US will do if the number of cases reaches a significantly higher peak and how the healthcare system will deal with it if this was to happen. If the virus got too out of hand and a large majority of the population had it, then I want to know if we would go into a lock down or an extreme state of emergency. I'm also curious to see if the precautions are actually effective since the number of cases went down when the precautions started.\n3.) The graph shows how social distancing and being in quarantine can be effective to stopping the corona virus. Before the US went into a national state of emergency and enforced social distancing and being in quarantine, the number of cases in the US was at its highest amount and only started to go down when the healthcare system enforced the quarantine and social distancing of civilians. My catchy headline would be \"Refuse quarantine and we all suffer the consequences\".",

In the actual graph, there are two arcs, one labeled without protective measures and one labeled with protective measures. In the graph. there is also a line saying the healthcare system capacity. I noticed that the without protective measures arc has a steeper incline and a quicker drop than the arc with protective measures. The arc with protective measures has a much smaller increase over a longer period of time. I wonder if the without protective measures arc takes a shorter amount of time because the people are dying so there are fewer people to spread the virus.

The blue curve just barely stays under the healthcare line and slowly starts to recede. One thing I wonder about is why the cases decrease faster for the non-protective measures compared to the With protective measures. Could this downward path possibly be caused by cases that result in death from overexposure? Could it be that people heal faster when unprotected? If so what's the science behind it? From this graph, we can confirm what scientists have been telling us about social distancing and it's correlation to having less of a chance of catching the virus as opposed to continuing life as normal. The red curve looks like at it's peak it has risen twice the size of the blue one. I also wonder about how this graph would change if it were to display the numbers in different countries or states? Is one country/state doing better at protecting themselves than the other? If so what are they doing? Does the environment of the place affect results?

However, if we do not flatten the curve, there would be chaos and exhausted healthcare workers, similar to now. I wonder if there would be a situation where human existence would end because of a pandemic since some people can't control it immediately. I think this could be possible since nowadays, in my opinion, society reacts more slowly to serious problems.

Whereas the red section (the section that represents without protective measures) goes above the healthcare limit almost forthwith. I have concluded that this graph is showing the readers how social distancing does not evidently decrease the spread of viruses, but slows the spread to a rate were our healthcare can provide for the sick people. The blue section demonstrates the spread of viruses slowed, so that it can be handled, and the red section represents everyone getting ill at once, causing the sick people to go into a state of non-provision. \nOne wondering that I have about this graph is if social distancing will, along with slowing the spread of viruses, reduce the amount of people infected with the viruses. I am wondering this because there seems to be around the same amount of area covered by both of the sections. I am curious as to social distancing will just slow the spread, or if it will reduce the contamination. \nThe above graph is representing how social distancing can slow the spread of viruses so that the healthcare system is not overwhelmed by the amount of cases, and can provide care and treatment for the infected people, reducing the fatalities.",

This seems to be the goal of our healthcare systems and our country collectively so that they are able to save and help as many people as possible. \n\nHowever, when I look at the red curve, I really question if that is the best thing for our country. If we implement all of these precautions, it looks as if its going to take two to three times longer to get over this disease; but, if we don't use protective measures, we will be able to return to a normal lifestyle much faster.

I wonder what it would be like if we didn't have protective measures? how many people would be sick? What would happen with jobs? how many people would be dead? overall what would our society turn into without these measures we are taking? I wonder what other measures we could have taken earlier on when we first noticed this virus to help stop the spread?\n3.)  so basically this graph is showing that without protective measures it would be way worse and the health care providers would not be able to control the situation as much.

There is a large spike in the number of cases that in-turn breaks through the healthcare systems capacity when there are no protective measures. However, the number of cases approaches zero much faster then the other model. When there are protective measures put it place, the extent of the healthcare system is not passed. It is a more gradual display that does not reach an extremely high number of cases in one situation, but it is drawn out over a longer period of time. In the end, the two models equal the same number of cases, but in different ways. I wonder what the exact number of cases is that overwhelms the healthcare system?

On the other hand, without protective measures overloads the system because it is beyond the limit. This is not surprising because the red group(without protective measures) is not using methods like social distancing so obviously that group is bigger because they are not protecting themselves by staying home and away from other people. These types of people will make it challenging for the United States to fix this issue quickly if the virus keeps on spreading to people who don't take protective measures.

If we do social distance, it slows down the spread rate, giving the healthcare system more time to help the infected.

After the sudden rise in the case, especially in Wuhan and Italy where the hospital are lacking enough care units, many government have asked their citizens to get into quarantine even if one is not infected in order to reduce the speed of transmission of this virus. As people are now more aware and taking precautions to keep themselves at home, wearing masks and washing hands, the number of cases per day has reduced and falling within the resources available for the healthcare system.\nI wonder for how long the COVID-19 transmission chain will go on and when that stage would come when the graph will approach zero.\nHeadline: \"Moving from uphill to plateau of Covid-19\"",

Also, the peak of cases with protective measures is right in the middle of the graph, the peak of the number of cases without protective measures is right at the beginning, so that means it will get very bad very fast. After looking at this graph, I believe that protective measures are very important and they need to be taken in order for the healthcare system to treat the coronavirus in a timely manner. \nI am wondering, after seeing how much trouble Italy is in, is the graph without protective measures based on Italy\u2019s situation? It seems like Italy got very bad very fast, due to the percentage of older people in their population and the fact that parts of Italy are still developing and probably many other factors. \nIn the graph, the main headline that is going around is to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d, that is because the main idea of this graph is to continue taking protective measures such as self-quarantine in order to keep the number of cases of coronavirus under the hospital's maximum capacity. If that doesn\u2019t happen, many more people will get sick all around the same amount of time, which would flood the hospitals leading to a lack of resources and possibly many more deaths or major cases.

By looking at the graph it is showing the number of cases with and without protective measures and if the capacity of the healthcare system slowing the virus down. I wonder how long it will take to flatten the curve and also the amount of time for the coronavirus to be completely over and dealt with. The graph shows how it is less likely to catch the coronavirus with protective measures such as social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your eyes and face, etc... and it is more likely to catch it without using protective measures such as close contact with people and not washing your hands.",

It's also telling us that protective measures work to limit the number of cases that exist. One thing I noticed is how the cases start to go away. Without protective measures, there are a lot more overall cases, but there is a steep drop off at the end. With protective measures, there are fewer cases, but there is a longer period of time where they exist.",

I've heard the term \"flatten the curve\"(which refers to flattening the \"Without Protective Measures\" curve) all around the media these days. I wonder if, in addition to \"flattening the curve\", could we possibly lift the line (that is, the dotted blue line labeled \"Healthcare system capacity\") in order to support even more cases? And how would we do that? My title for this graph is \"It's All in the Numbers.\"",

It definitely seems important to lift the Healthcare System Capacity line as we begin social distancing.  As soon as the number of cases reaches the line, I would predict that cases would begin to exponentially increase as patients are unable to receive treatment.  I would suspect that in order to lift the capacity line, the government could supply hospitals with necessary means such as masks and ventilators.",

If we enact less protective measures we will have more stress put on our healthcare systems; however, if we as a society choose to self-quarantine, practice social distancing, and act together to protect ourselves, the stress put on our healthcare systems can decrease.
