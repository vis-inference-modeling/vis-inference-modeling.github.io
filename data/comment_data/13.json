    "comment info": "For this assignment, students were asked to pick a graph that interested them and interpret it in as many ways as possible. This graph first caught my eye because of its relevance to my real life and how it has and will impact me in the years to come/years past. What I notice about this graph is that from the 1980s-2000 hurricanes and other natural disasters didn\u2019t happen very often and were not nearly as costly. I also noticed that the two highest years, cost wise, are 2005 and 2018. In 2018, there were four major natural disasters that cost millions of dollars. While in 2005, there was one major disaster that was so devastating it cost about \u00be of what 2018 had brought. These pieces of data show me that in more recent times natural disasters have been increasing at a concerning rate and this could potentially be due to human errors and other factors. Secondly, what I wonder from this graph is exactly why these natural disasters have increased so much in recent years. I can\u2019t think of any major reasons that these disasters would sky rocket so high in 2018. Another thing that I can wonder from this graph is why Hurricane Katrina was so costly. I wasn\u2019t born yet for this hurricane, so I\u2019m not exactly sure the damage it caused. Lastly, I also am wondering if in 2019 and all the years after that the natural disaster rate will be as high as it was in 2018. I\u2019m not sure if this is easily predictable, but I believe it can be solved. (cont in next post)",

The cost of natural disasters has steadily increased over the years. Has the cost of rebuilding increased significantly? 2017 was the most expensive year in natural disasters. The California wildfire costs were 18 billion last year and Hurricane Katrina was the most expensive natural disaster overall.

Social media increases the speed with which we learn about natural disasters, so might that associate with money spent in recovery?\n\nComparing 2004 to 2005, the counts of hurricanes are equal but the expense ratio appears to be roughly 3:1.  Is this related to the intensity of just 1 hurricane?\n\nPopulation density shifts in the last 10 years creates more structures which are put at risk in a hurricane.\n\nWe noticed that the CA wildfires were highlighted in 2017, but the expense is not in step with the other damage estimates given.

We wonder if that was because the hurricanes were not as strong or if the cost to repair infrastructure was lower. We also noticed that disaster costs of Hurricane Katrina were more than Hurricane Maria, Irma and the California wildfires from last year. Graph A only shows the number of hurricanes from 1900 until 2017 while Graph B shows all natural disasters from 1980 until last year. Graph B only shows damage costs if they are over 1 billion dollars. Wildfire damages cost less than hurricane damages.
