This indicates that states are starting to shift farther from a balance between republican and democrats, becoming strongholds by the year. The spread of states from a tie indicates how polarized our country is becoming, since each state is becoming strongly associated with one party or another. Therefore, our elections are constantly being decided by the few swing states. Only these states have a major influence due to the landslides every year in other states. I hope the parties won\u2019t give up on trying to flip a state even if it seems out of reach. I also hope voters believe their vote makes a difference. Then all 50 states will contribute to electing future presidents. \n2. \nI wonder if parties will still spend time trying to win the voters of the states they had but now have lost. I think they should absolutely do so. Georgia was out of reach for Democrats in 2004 but has flipped blue in this most recent election. With this strategy both parties can win back states they previously had. \n3. \nBeing from Boston, this will likely have a miniscule effect on my state. Massachusetts hasn\u2019t flipped red since Regan and they have been shifting more left ever since.

I also notice how the bolded states are states of voters that have changed their parties in any of the past five elections. Not only did they chose opposing sides, but also chose the candidate to best represent that side. The graph clearly shows a dramatic increase of democrats more than republicans. The graph lines are labeled in blue and red, (red meaning republicans and blue meaning democrats). As the years went by, the numbers of democrats has dramatically increased while the republicans has decreased. This has a strong impact on the people because the people's opinions matter and these opinions and voices are being reflected on the votes. The farther the lines from the middle of the graph, the more republicans/democrats.

The following years illustrate the same concept, that democrats don\u2019t always vote blue and republicans don\u2019t always vote red, but both parties for the candidate with political philosophy and plans most aligning to their own, often independent of \u201cred\u201d or \u201cblue.\u201d\nI wonder why in 2012,  some states voted almost completely republicans and others almost completely democratic.  I wonder if the further division caused by the media was a factor in why the 2020 election had some states exceptionally blue and others exceptionally red. I also wonder why states like Utah, Hawaii, and North Carolina had such a fluid change in the voting in these elections.\nAn impact that this could have is thats it is less likely for more worthy candidates to run for president given the amount of backlash they receive, republican or democrat. It\u2019s also less likely that there will be as many voters next election because this year, neither candidate was liked very much; most people said they had to choose the \u201clesser of two evils.\u201d \nCatchy Headline:  Swinging Left and Right",

In 2008, when president Obama was elected, the number of republicans were hugely decreased while the number of democrats raised by a lot. That year was definitely the year where there were the most changes in people's political party. Then in 2016, when President Trump was elected, the number of democrats and republicans appear to be a lot more balanced out and less right sided like the years before that. 2020, even though a democrat president was elected, appear to has a very nice balance between the number of republicans and democrats in the country\n\nWhat do you wonder? Why there weren't as much of a dramatic shift in 2016 compare to 2008?\n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community? The graph shows that in recent years, people are not as one-sided in their political view than other year, creating a more centered and balance environment in America. When the supports of political party are not visibly one-sided, people will have more confidence in stating and sharing their opinions rather than staying quite and fear of the majority\n\nCaption: 2020, the year of changes and balance even in political party.",

We also notice that there are multiple states being connected by the same line. Another thing we noticed is that voting by the party has varied in the past couple of years. We thought it was interesting that in 2008 there was a big swing left and many republicans voted for Barack Obama. We wonder why a lot of republicans that had voted for Obama decided not to in 2012. After 2012 it started to even out again. One thing we wonder is why republican votes seem to be inconsistent and we wonder if they will continue to vary as time goes on.

I noticed that a lot of voters swayed to voting for Obama in the election of 2008, even though some of the states had been barely Democratic or had voted Republican. Immediately, I noticed the huge sway of voters in Obama's favor.   I noticed that within the past 5 elections, there have been many states that have flipped from conservative to democratic. I wonder what about Utah makes it such a republican state. I wonder what makes Utah stay consistently on the deep Republican side. I wonder what it was that made the states switch and why there aren\u2019t as many states that have flipped over to conservative. This impacts our community because it shows how the people around us have voted for the past 5 elections.

The one thing I wonder though is why this trend happened? With Obama's seemingly overwhelming support via votes, wouldn't it be reasonable to guess that he could accomplish a lot and have a high approval rating, keeping that trend going for the next presidents? What specifically happened during that presidency that led people to reconsider their choices, and according to votes drastically shift the balance towards a more 50/50 split? Within my community, I don't necessarily think this graph affects it. My state has historically tended to vote based on the most populous city and as such our voting if put on a graph would be a straight line.

In 2008, quite a few states turned blue and voted for Obama. When it came to his reelection in 2012, he had fewer votes as a couple of states turned back to red but still had enough votes to win. However, in 2016, these same swing states turned red. For the 2020 election, some states flipped again and voted blue, while some states remained red. For each party, however, there are states that haven't flipped for any election. \n\nI wonder what this graph would look like for past elections and what it will look like in the future. I also wonder what characterizes a swing state and what causes it to flip almost every election. Why are they more likely to flip parties each election? In Obama's 2008 election, I wonder what pulled voters in and caused so many states to flip blue. At the same time, I wonder why a couple flipped back to red during his reelection?\n\nThis impacts me and my community because it shows just how divided votes are and also how they can change each election. I live in Massachusetts, which is a strong democratic state and unlikely to flip.

    "comment info": "I notice that over the course of the 16 years, voting by party has varied for many states. In 2004, the two sides are almost symmetrical, but if anything, more states had more republican voters. Then in 2008, there was a significant swing to the left, as many states who had a moderate number of Republican voters in 2004, voted for Barack Obama in 2008. Between 2012 and 2020, the two sides mostly evened out again, with some states varying back and forth. In 2020 it appears the lines are starting to pull left again, which makes sense considering Biden won the election and several swing states has voted in his favor. Although the lines are quite curved, which shows they shifted a lot, however, throughout, there are states that stayed strongly to one of either side, showing that recently the country has been extremely divided by political parties. I wonder why Barack Obama so strongly pulled so many voters from swing states and even weak/moderate republican voting states? And why did they swing back to republican voting the next year? This impacts me and my community because it shows how divided our country is and this division has recently been creating a lot of struggles in our country. It's scary because the media in predominantly republican areas displays very different coverage than I get living in Massachusetts, therefore, I feel political parties continue to get even more divided until this problem is solved. \n\nWaves of Political Party Voting (2004-2020)",

Between the 2004 and 2008 election, almost every state's votes (even Republican ones) became more Democratic. Between the 2008 and 2012 election, most state's votes became more Republican. In the last two elections (2016 and 2020) the state's votes changed by a smaller degree and more randomly. In the last two elections, there was neither a more Democratic trend nor a more Republican trend between all the states. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why so many more people voted Democratic in the 2008 election, and I wonder why so many more people voted Republican in the 2012 election. Is it because people were unsatisfied with the Presidents of the time? Were they hoping for a more radical change by flipping their votes?\n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nI live in a state that has voted Democratic since 2004. Since 2004, my state's slightly more Democratic, a fact that I am not surprised by. Thus, party shifting does not impact my community as much as it might impact people in Vermont or Ohio. However, as party views become more one-sided in my state, my community's values tend to surround me in school and on social media. \n\nHeadline:\nAre you indecisive?

A majority of the states in the 2016 election voted more towards the right and swing states voted republican. I wonder why in each election, except 2012, the president keeps shifting from one party to another party. Maybe it's because people aren't satisfied with the state of the country and think the other party, that's not currently in office, can make life better for Americans.\n\nThis effects my community because I live in NJ, a primarily blue state. Although NJ hasn't voted Republican since 1988, I notice a lot of my classmates and a growing amount of people in my community are conservative. It will be interesting to see when/if New Jersey will vote Republican again and what factors will push them towards voting red.\n\nUS Elections: Shifting of Political Parties",

Many of the republican states in the south also became less republican and more democratic, despite them still being counted as republican states. The following years following 2016-2020, a lot of the blue states became more republican while the republican states continued to become more republican. \n2. I wonder what made the states sway from a democratic lean during 2008-2012 to a more republican lean during 2016-2020. I wonder if it was because the winning candidate's persuasion to have an impact on states votes, or if there was any voter fraud that may have swayed the votes to a certain candidate. \n3. The impact that this has on our community is that it shows where our state falls and the typical values and political beliefs that the people where I live feel. I can see that Massachusetts has always been a democratic state, and has been one of the few to get more democratic throughout the years. This shows that most people here have democratic beliefs. \n4. Possible title: \"US Elections: To be More Red or to be More Blue?\"",

This makes a decent amount of sense, seeing as most states tend to be more moderate in their voting tendencies, not voting 100% for the same party. There is also a significant dip in data points around the middle tie line. This could be because each state tends to lean more heavily to one party in their voting, rather that having a total tie. \n2. I wonder if this is only for the presidential candidates, or an average of the elections as a whole. Meaning is this just assessing the presidential votes, or also counting each states smaller elections.  \n3. I think its a little funny to see Utah having voted completely republican, for Mitt Romney over Obama. The following election, there was a super large push back against the republican candidate. I noticed that Utah in this last election is closer to Dem. than any previous election. \n4. Making Waves: States Flip Sides",

Out of the five selected elections, Obama\u2019s 08 was the most far leaning to one side.

I wonder about the future of the republican party. It seems from this data that the Republican party has weaker voters as time goes on. I would say this is because of the influx of younger voters. It is proven that younger votes are more democratic, and as times goes on, I think American will be seeing less and less Republican presidents.\n3.

This does not have a huge impact on my specific community because I live in a blue state that has consistently voted democratic for many consecutive years. However, as a nation, this affects us greatly because it shows the inconsistencies and the inability to truly predict who will win elections, as states are prone to flip frequently. \n4. In this graph, it shows the flipped voters, primarily on the Republican side. I would name this article \"A Decade of Party Flips\".",

That most likely has to do with the fact that maybe some people didn\u2019t like what Obama did with his first 4 years in The White House. We see those republican votes basically stay still when Donald Trump won in 2016. Once again probably because a lot of Trump\u2019s campaigning was speaking against the Democratic Party.

Also, I noticed that in the 2008 election many states moved closer to the blue side of the graph and then in 2016 those same states that flipped blue switched back to red. \n\nI wonder why certain states are more likely to flip than other states are and I would like to know if there is a particular reason people in some states are constantly flipping political parties. \n\nThe impact that this graph has on me is that the way people vote will affect the outcome of the election, and the new president will have control over what is going on in America.\n\nThis graph demonstrates how parties have shifted over many different elections and in some cases voted for the opposite party than they did four years prior.

The graph is a little bit confusing to me because it is difficult to see where each state is listed. I wonder if it is possible for a state to have a tie during a presidential election. This effects my community because the president creates policies which impact the lives of all Americans. In addition, the words of the president can heavily shape the political climate and political attitudes of the people.
