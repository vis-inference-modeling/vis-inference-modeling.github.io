Personally, it looks like whoever made this graph/took a survey on this, they were probably on the older side and have listened to the bottom row only once. The top row is probably most familiar to them. Music is NOT becoming more and more similar. If anything, it's expanding the limits and trying newer things than ever before. This graph is silly and has so much bias it's crazy :P",

The shape of the sonic fingerprint is determined by how cheerful the song sounds, likelihood the song uses acoustic instruments, how fast and noisey the song sounds, and the strength and regularity of the song\u2019s beat. I notice that for each year displayed, there are several thin shapes, with a thick outlined circle on top. I infer that these several thinner circles refer to other hits of that particular summer, or perhaps even year. I see how for the somewhat circle-shaped \u201cfingerprints,\u201d those colored hot pink have several thin circles underneath them moving in several different directions, while those colored blue have several thin circles underneath them that tend to overlap and resemble each other. This pattern makes sense, because hot pink indicates the hits of that year or summer are different, and thus have different acoustics, danceability, energy, and/or valence. Likewise, this trend make sense also for the blue circles, as blue indicates the hits are similar, and thus the shape of the thin blue circles are generally the same. Among each fingerprint, I notice that danceability is a consistently prominent factor in determining whether or not a song becomes a top hit. I wonder, has this always been the case? Why or why not? This graph is very creative and unlike any graph I\u2019ve seen before, so I wonder who created it and how he/she thought of the idea?",

Another thing is that the majority of the hits are energetic. I also noticed that with the most of the newer songs are well balanced. And finally, I noticed that \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\" (1988) and \"Rush, Rush\" (1991) were very different from the other hits from that year in one category.\nThings that I was wondering are how the differential scale was created, and why these 8 years were chosen? It really boggles me why there would be such a large gap in the years that were chosen.\n\nMy title is:\nPlaying through the Footprints of Music History",

Come back tomorrow for The Reveal that explains radar graphs and when they are used.  They are not only for pop music.\nThe differential scale is based on the Spotify algorithm that is used for choosing music.  Search online to see if you can find out more about the algorithm.\nThere\u2019s a quick reason why the fingerprints skip from 1991 to 2015.  We could not fit all 20 on the release.  But, please come back tomorrow for The Reveal which will share the link to the graph\u2019s article with all 20 fingerprints.  The article is a first for us -- you listen to it, rather than read it.  It gives a few reasons for the homogeneity of summer hits.  And, reasons for why this may be changing.",

Along with that though, the songs that are more recent are also more balanced, like \"Despacito\" and \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\", and songs like \"Vision of Love\" and Rush, Rush\" are more focused on one or two \"areas\" in the fingerprint. \n\nI began to wonder what the bar at the top meant, where they are different colors, and it says \"Hits are different - Hits are similar\". I was wondering what it is helpful.\n\nI thought about a title idea for this for a while, and decided that I think a title that could fit is \"Music's Evolution and How We Hear the Songs\"",

Especially when you examine the 20 fingerprints that are in the article (URL in today's Reveal), you'll see that they go from pink up until 1997 to purple, and then to blue -- from different to similar in sound.

Graphs and data like this make it quite hard for me to justify the music played today as equatable to that of the 80's- music of their time. I notice that from 1988-1991, the music hits were different, according to the pink coloring and the scale. I then notice that from 2015-1028, the music hits were similar, according to the blue coloring and the scale. I can hear my dad saying, \"They don't make any original compositions anymore,\" in the back of my head. I wonder why the energy aspect of the footprint increases as we go from 1990 to 2018. In other words, the fast and noisy song sounds that my dad refers to as bass is used a lot more today than it was in the past. This is furthered by the acousticness remaining rather similar for the 2000's. I wonder if fans of the 80's would agree on the danceability aspect of the song's footprints for the 2000's. Thank you, Mariah Carey and Paula Abdul, for quieting the volume for a bit. I am curious as to why \"On Our Own,\" and \"Can't Stop the Feeling\" have very similar footprints.... A catchy headline for this graph could be, \"What Your Parents Always Tell You About Your Music\".",

I think that the increasing cheerfulness and energy of the modern songs of the summer is a testament to the young population of America.  The acousticness of the songs has greatly gone down over time.  I wonder if this has to do with modern technology in the music industry and that since it is so easy now to create a sound electronically, artists are beginning to stray from the acoustic sound.

    "comment info": "This graph compares the sonic \"fingerprints\" of eight different top ten summer hits in two different ranges of time. The color of these graphs are determined by how different or similar the hits are to the other music of the time. There is a stark difference between the colors of the music between 1988-1991 and that of 2015-2018. \n\nOverall, the earlier music became popular despite its differences from other music of the time. In fact, these hits gained popularity because they were outliers from what was generally expected of music. This is exemplified through the use of no primarily blue shades. On the other hand, the more current set of hits veers towards the similar side of the spectrum. These songs have similarly shaped graphs and use either a blue or cooler purple shade. This reveals that the most popular music of the summer today is not very different from any other run of the mill song. In this way, people in society have been conditioned to like and accept the same types of songs as popular. \n\nThe more different hits of the late 80s and early 90s show a more diverse group of musical styles ranging from rock to pop to love songs. Because of this, the graph shows the decline of the popularity of a variety of songs and the rise of one type of pop song. \n\nA good name for this graph would be, \"Starting to Sing All the Same Songs\"",

In change, from 2015 to 2018, songs have been so similar maybe because artists copy but hits cover all the four loudness to average the volume of the song.",

You mention that the artists may copy other successful songs in hopes of having successful songs themselves. Do you think that this limit's an artist's options when writing a new song?

    "comment info": "I notice that hits in recent years are trending to be a lot more similar in nature. Compared to 1988-1991 where hits are varied, hits in 2015-2018 are more 'Energetic' and have much higher 'Danceability' which says that a lot of the music is more pop/electronic oriented than the decade prior. As well, I've noticed that there is a decline in acoustic instruments being used in songs between the two time ranges.\n\nI wonder about the cause of the trend in music tending to be more similar in nature in recent years (especially 2018)? Could this be that artists might be emulating successful song formats in an effort to 'make it big'? Also, I wonder if there is correlation into why hits in 1988-1991 appear more cheerful than in recent years? It looks likes we've strayed from cheerful, acoustic hits to higher energy/danceable hits that are less cheerful\n\nThe story this graph is telling is that over the years, we have stayed from more acoustic driven hits to more homogenized hits that sound the same but have a better beat.",

Is Drake\u2019s Nice For What\u201d as similar as the other 9 hits for that summer?  Or, is he going in a different direction?  \nPlease come back tomorrow for The Reveal.  We\u2019ll share the link to the graph\u2019s article.  A first for us -- you listen to it, rather than read it.  It gives a few reasons for the homogeneity of summer hits.  And, reasons for why this may be changing.  \nDo you have a catchy headline to share with us that captures the main idea of the graphs?",
