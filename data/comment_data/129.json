I figure that out of all of the words that were depicted in this visual, that is the one that may have had the most universal impact on the people surveyed. Gas is necessary to commute anywhere with a motor vehicle, whereas some other words that were mentioned in the visual do not have the same level of necessity and lack of substitutes. I noticed that food items were colored orange and that they made up the majority of the goods mentioned, with milk, meat, and beef as the top three foods. I wonder how this survey was conducted, like what groups of people they decided to survey. I wonder how the survey and the most mentioned words would look depending on different socioeconomic groups. I wonder what the visual would look like if it was organized based on the actual impact that inflation had on the price of the good. I imagine that although some of the products mentioned might not have had the highest overall price change due to inflation but rather the most used products make it so people are more likely to notice.",

People feel the impact of higher gas prices much more than something such as yogurt because gas for many people is a necessity. This can be applied to the whole graph. It seems as though the products that were voted for the most are very common, necessary products. The foods people are voting for are foods that are extremely common to find in a household and are purchased regularly. So it would make sense that people notice a price increase on something they are so used to buying.",

I also noticed that the gas received the most votes and the size of the word depended on how many votes it got. The orange words were food items and the gray items were non food essentials. I wonder what the purpose of creating the graph was and what the numbers on each item represent. This relates to me and my community because gas prices are at an all-time high, which might be why gas was the most voted word. I also think it relates to me and my community because maybe the most voted words are items that are in highest demand and it could also have to do with inflation because the top items are things people use on a daily basis.",

In the survey that they collected majority of the people mentioned gas, milk, meat, and beef as the products and services that have been raised higher in prices. Those are only 4 products/ services that have been named for getting more expensive (about over 290 people have voted on these 4). Towards the bottom there are is shampoo, liquor, cookies as just a few of the the people (7) have voted that have had a higher price.\n-I wonder how many more people would agree with the small sample from the survey? Meaning if this survey was sent out to every adult in the United States either by mail or Email would these be the only products/ services that would be listed? or Would there be more products listed? Also if gas would still be number one in this list for all Americans?\n-This has an impact on me and my community because lets say that the graph is true meaning that it is stating facts than as a community we are going to need to figure out how to fix this problem. Gas is essential for cars that take us to places, Milk is around the number 1 or 2 thing that is used in foods that we as a community eat as a whole. If these products/services keep raising their prices maybe we won't be able to afford any of the necessary items that we need.\n-Has the world changed in what is considered expensive or have we as a community changed?",

Although the main ingredient of foods such as bread and meats were most expensive.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\n\nBetween gas and meat I wonder why there is that entirely big gap difference.It is also uncommon to see but I wonder how haircuts in the third row have big gray letters as a top item to become more expensive. I am very curious about that one compared to how groceries were considered less expensive than haircuts? mhm interesting.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nWell it relates worldwide other than just my precise community, especially those who are not wealthy or even a stable wealthy enough to pay for gas, utilities and groceries when they were at the lowest of prices.Now that the prices are rising up it put bad jeopardy in families all over. So in reality it is not good for the prices to go up due to not everyone being able to afford then again companies need business so it's a 50/50 hard plan here.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?

However, I was surprised that milk was second highest. I have not heard much about milk prices being raised, but I also do not frequently go to the grocery store, so that may be why. I believe that these items are becoming more expensive due to shortages, but I am not sure why there would be a dairy or meat shortage.

We can\u2019t eat shampoo because it\u2019s toxic for our bodies.

Gas is a very big topic especially now as processes are and will continue to go up with the current conflict involving Russia. It is not surprising that almost a thousand people put the gas down. Milk, meat, beef, and chicken are the next couple of big words that a majority of people put. This is probably because they are staples in many households. When these staples' prices go up, people are more likely to notice the prices are going up for something they buy consistently and constantly. You can see the further you look and the fewer people put the word down, the more specific the wrod gets. If there were more general categories given I wonder how that would affect the results.

The first thing I notice is how gas is the #1 thing that had had a noticeable price increase. The rest of the products that people noticed had higher prices were mainly food products, specifically animal products like milk, meat, and eggs. I wonder what is causing the increase in the prices of animal products and if it could be because of disease or food shortages for the animals. The increased gas prices could be due to the war between Russia and Ukraine. Russia has since cut oil production, resulting in a 10% decrease of the world oil supply, which could cause increased gas prices in the US.

I also see 73 of the products listed are food while 53 are other products. I wonder why the price of foods has significantly increased more over the past year than other products. I see lots of meat in the highest-raised products which makes me want to learn why meats specifically are getting more expensive. This graph relates to me and my community because the prices of all the products listed in the graph are bought by my family and the high prices affect our lives in many ways. The increased prices make it more difficult to constantly buy these needs which are crucial in our everyday lives like gas, food, cleaning supplies, etc. A headline that summarizes this graph is, \"Increasing Prices of Everyday Items.\"",

I also notice that edible items are in orange while the resources and supplies such as gas and clothing are in grey. Next to the graph, there is a notice describing that the statistics are based on \"how many people mentioned each item\"\n2. I wonder who was interviewed for this survey? What age range was represented, what geographical area was interviewed, was there a bias of race or gender? I also wonder what they asked and when. For example, if the question was \"Where/what have you noticed there being a large price increase on?\" the answers may vary based on what is going on in the world such as the blockage of the Panama Canal last year.\n3. I think this represents what people across the country and around me have been spending money on/ noticed the price increases meaning that this most likely reflects the prices of items around me such as the dramatic rise in gas prices. These higher prices add up over time combined with low wages is causing many people around me to struggle financially and if this graph represents this it shows just how deep-rooted and far these price increases range that many wouldn't first think of.\n4.

Additionally, gas is really important in life since we use it for many things and are main for live, and if this source is expensive is going to be hard to get it.\n\nLife is getting expensive",
