I notice that these areas are more concentrated in the west side of the country as well as close to the Canadian Border.  The lowest concentration of endangered species are in the MidWest which makes sense because that is where human population is less dense. Therefore, there is less industrialization and less human activity.

First, I wonder why the coastal regions are experiencing the highest rates of endangered biodiversity.

Also, I wonder if the midwest\u2019s less densely populated areas are why the region is shown as the least endangered.\n3.

Imperiled biodiversity refers to plants and animals that are in danger of becoming extinct and making the area less diverse with different species. I noticed the areas with the highest concentrations of imperiled biodiversity are in the California and south east areas. One possible explanation for this is climate change, which is creating higher temperatures and drought. This can lead to the destruction of many habitats for plants and animals because they no longer have the necessary conditions to thrive in. Additionally, the recent increase in wildfires in California could also contribute to imperiled biodiversity. California also has the most permanently protected areas, which could be an effort to decrease the high concentration of imperiled biodiversity.

The west is due to it\u2019s hot and dry climate, combined with droughts, and some pollution, it adds to the ever growing mix. Also, going down south, the intense summer humidity, devastating hurricanes, and constant tourism equates to a deadly environment for plants to grow. And as you move up the coast from there to the Eastern sections of the Country, a common pattern of major cities emerge, resulting in enormous amounts of pollution.

An interesting thing relating to this is the fact that right next to the most concentrated area of imperiled biodiversity is an area permanently protected for biodiversity. I wonder why the west coast has such a major switch in the amount of imperiled diversity so close to each other. I also wonder if areas that are on the opposite ends of the spectrum of biodiversity are affected by the leaders of those specific states and/or districts.

Biodiversity is defined as the level of variation in plants and animals in a specific area. Biodiversity is extremely important, especially because it contributes to natural processes, ones that help humans. I notice that in states with higher populations, or where there are major cities, the risk of biodiversity being threatened is extremely high. For example, the westernmost side of California is extremely threatening to biodiversity, because those are where all the major cities are. However, on the easternmost side of the state, where there are more national parks and lower populations, biodiversity is protected. I wonder how biodiversity will be affected, especially considering the fact that many new cities, like Birmingham, AL - where biodiversity is already threatened - are growing and continuing to gain population.

Interestingly, California also has a large area of green, which could be explained by the state being 'blue' and boasting 9 national parks that have to be protected. Areas along the coast have higher concentrations of imperiled biodiversity. I notice the plains seem to not have any concerns regarding biodiversity and that region is sparsely populated and very rural.\n\nI wonder if the map also has political ties, along with environmental ones. I wonder how we choose which lands to protect. I wonder if people's actions contribute to the concentration of imperiled biodiversity. I wonder if the climate change movement can reverse any of the red areas.\n\nThis greatly impacts our environment and food chains/webs. It can affect whether some organisms become extinct or endangered, which would affect the overall habitat and how it functions. Living in Florida, most of our ecosystem consists of wetlands, swamps like the Everglades, and mangrove forests. With such diverse ecosystems, it's safe to assume that many would want to conserve them. However,  the rapid expansion of constructing buildings like houses, shopping centers, and restaurants is destroying the available space living organisms can habitat.

Not sure if you can see this in this map since the protected areas are superimposed on the concentrations of imperiled biodiversity.  \n\nIf you go to the NatureServe website, you can tease out these two categories.

I notice that the west coast is heavily more protected than the east coast with large spans of green protected areas, in the midwest, there is little green but also is much less damaged, and in areas where there are larger red sections there are more green areas but the ratio between red and green is still in red favors.\n2. I wonder what total percent of the continental U.S is protected, why is the south so red throughout, and why do the colors get redder the closer to the coastlines.\n3. Living in Florida much of the land is heavily wetlands with diverse ecosystems such as swamps like the everglades and mangrove forests. With such diverse ecosystems, it's safe to assume that many would want to protect them and as time goes on, however, especially in my direct location in central Florida, the rapid expansion of housing units is destroying these important areas. The tearing down of these habitats has led the local animals homeless and led to many of their deaths. The farther this spreads past the Orlando area the worse the damage to the ecosystems will get. Destroying not only the animals' homes but also tweaking defense systems against weather such as hurricanes.\n4. How urbanization has affected ecosystems across America",

I also noticed that Florida and California have the highest amount of red but the middle of USA is all white and green. The green in the white area might be national parks or Wildlife sanctuaries since there are no harm done to nature there. The green on top of white shows a preventative approach to conservation. The green and red areas, like in Florida or California, that means that the government took action in those areas since there is so much wildlife harm done there and they need to protect the wildlife. This is a reactive approach to conservation. I also see that in Texas there is a lot of vein-like red areas. My prediction is that those rivers have been polluted, maybe by pesticides that have fallen into the river since most farms will be near a water source.
