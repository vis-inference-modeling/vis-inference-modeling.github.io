I also noticed that there is only one axis determining how fast the pair of Nike Vaporfly allow people to run. I  wonder  why they don\u2019t have an x and a y-axis considering that if they are trying to persuade people to buy the Vapor Fly they could probably also compare the cost of the Vapor Fly to other shoes. The information the graph tells me that I already know is that  certain shoes can affect how fast you run, depending on the support they provide, and the weight of the shoes. The information the graph tells me that I didn\u2019t know yet is that the Nike Vapor fly can make you run 4% faster than other shoes. I also didn\u2019t know how large the difference was or that the type of shoe could affect speed that much. The conclusion that I can make about the information shown in the graph is that the Nike Vapor fly allow people to run much faster than most normal shoes, and that serious runners should consider buying them, do to how much they benefit a runner's speed.",

A new study shows that people run slower when wearing heavier sneakers, even if the difference is just a few ounces.\n\nIt\u2019s long been known that wearing heavier shoes makes runners work harder, and experts have theorized that that would slow them down. (One oft-cited estimate is that for every ounce a runner shaves off her sneakers, she'll run one second faster per mile.) But researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder wanted to find out for sure if this was true.]]\n\nThe researchers recruited 18 competitive runners to complete 3,000-meter time trials (about two miles) on an indoor track, once a week for three weeks. Unbeknownst to the runners, small lead pellets were sewn into two of the three pairs of racing flats they wore.\n\nBy themselves, the shoes weighed 7 to 8 ounces each, depending on size. The pellets added about 3.5 ounces (or the weight of a deck of cards) per shoe for one pair, and about 10.6 ounces per shoe for the second pair.",

The article \u201cWhat if a $250 Shoe Actually Made You Run Faster\u201d gives you Nike\u2019s explanation of Vaporflys and then explains four analyses that the New York Times did using Strava data.  For each of the analyses, the article lists the Pros and Cons of the analyses as well as additional reasons for being skeptical.  \nPlease take another look at the graph.  And, read the article \u201cWhat if a $250 Shoe Actually Made You Run Faster.\u201d  Also, you may want to read the subsequent article \u201cRunning Slower? Slip These On\u201d which describes two experiments on running shoes done by independent researchers.  \nFrom the all of the analysis done on Vaporflys and the interest in these graphs yesterday, people really want to know \u201cWhat if a $250 Shoe Actually Made You Run Faster.\u201d   Thank all of you for being part of this discussion.",

If Nike is going to use this survey to advertise their product, than they should create an experiment in which they are able to both validate running times, and collect a large enough sample size. Small sample sizes can be result in misleading data, and the self reporting of scores can lead to inaccurate responses. \n    Even if the people who did respond to this survey were telling the truth, there is a lot more bias behind the scenes. Runners had the choice of whether or not to respond to this survey. This leads to voluntary response bias. Another type of bias present is accessibility bias. Strava is an online fitness network, and runners who do not have access to the internet, or have not signed up are excluded from this sample. Nike is falling victim to convenience sampling.\n    There are so many different possibilities for lurking variables including the economic status (Vaporflys are $250!), gender, height, and foot width of the participants. \n    I wonder if there were any graphs accompanying this one that may dig deeper into some of the lurking variables.\n    For this graph to mean anything, it needs to have more data surrounding it, a clear description of how the data was collected, and a description of how Nike accounted for bias and lurking variables. \n    \u201cThe Nike Vaporflys might make you faster... I can\u2019t be sure though.... We don\u2019t have enough Information.\u201d",

    "comment info": "We noticed that Nike Vaporflys are much faster than your average running shoe. It makes us wonder if these running shoes are considered legal. After all, some races prohibit any shoes that might give any advantage in finishing faster. Is it possible that new technology advancements can question whether sport athletes have an unfair competitive advantage? Another thing that we noticed is that the graph states, \u201cWhen we measure finish times after runners switch to new shoes.\u201d This data wouldn\u2019t be able to support that Nike Vaporflys are able to make their consumers much faster but other graphs that use statistics based on a runners\u2019 age, genders, and/or other information essentially could do so. However, we also wondered whether the data was credible. In the source, it states that this data was recorded \u201cbased on runner self-reported race times and shoe records from about 4,000 runners, as reported to Strava, an online social fitness network.\u201d Self-reported race times can be somewhat unreliable considering that people might misspell the shoe name, fabricate different race times, etc. But, since this data was collected from 4,000 people (a large study group), we are uncertain on whether or not the data is viable. The story this graph is telling is whether or not Nike Vaporflys can make a person run faster than other shoes. Our catchy headline: \u201cWhat if there is a running shoe that can actually make you run faster?\u201d",

This graph shows the type of shoes and the time of the runs that witch shoes make this shoes faster. Nike Vaporfly, Nike Streak, new balance 860, brooks launch 6 top four running shoes and Hoka One One Bondi, Brooks Adrenaline, Saucony Omni are the slowest shoes I noticed that some of the shoes that are good are huge brands and expensive for example the Vaporfly is sold out and it's $250 shoes but most good running shoes are $80 to $150 so I think Vaporfly is overpriced for normal people but is good shoes for pro athletes that get paid. I noticed that the biggest group is between 0% and 2% difference from the runner's original speed. I wonder what factors of the sneakers make you \"faster\" for example I run 200m and 400m also marathon for 400 I do it between 58sec to 70sec with all my different shoes so it really doesn't do anything for my speed but for log runs the comfort and weight of those really matters because you get tired. The Vaporfly 4% never feels unstable or sloppy, and it weighs in at a scant 6.9 ounces im saying this because ran with them. But the last thing I want to say its all about endurance and traction and how good of a runner you are.",

First of all, I noticed that the biggest group is between 0% and 2% difference from the runner's original speed. I also realized that all Nike shoes are above 0% difference. I was wondering what shoes (or no shoes)  the runner's ran in to get their base speed. This could affect the difference that the Vaporfly makes if you already run in a faster shoe. I also wonder what makes the Vaporfly so much faster than the other shoes. Could it just be that you think they are faster so your body reacts that way.

Nike is one of the most innovative brands, they are very reliable, have been in the shoe business for decades This is because they listen to their customers extensively seeking answers for what they could change and what they would like to see in their next running shoe.

Maybe these are shoes used mostly by the most experienced runners.\nLook above the graph.  There is a brief explanation of how the shoes were tested.  Come back tomorrow and learn of six ways the shoes were compared, as well as how researchers selected the shoes tested.    \nThese are all great wonderings.  By wondering and asking others, you will uncover more insights into the graph and running shoes.",

But are they really cutting down time, or is it because these shoes are being represented by more people? Perhaps running times are being cut because of the excitement of a pair of new kicks, or maybe training just is aiding the time improvements. I noticed that the highest ranking shoes, like the Vaporfly, among others, have a very different look. Shoes that are taking more time have a higher quantity of different material: for example, the fastest shoes are more of a \"mesh\" fabric. In addition, they have more of a smooth curve for soles: they might aid the \"push\" of a runner's feet against the pavement. Slower shoes also have more \"ridges\" on the bottom, I noticed. \n\nOverall, I think the design plays a key role in faster shoes and faster times. I would be interested to see a study finding the impact of material and cushioning on running, with the same number of people for each shoe, and over a longer period of time.",
