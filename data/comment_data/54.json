Does this have to do with the world human population increasing or climate changes that have been occurring since 1970? Why are they  giving so many biomes percentages given and on the map only few biomes are being shown? \n\nWhat's going on: They're showing the U.S. and  Canada map and giving the graphs of biomes and the percentages of bird population change in them since 1970. They're also giving us the net loss of birds in the biomes.\n\nTitle: Gone by the years, goodbye birds.",

Presumably, global warming is warming this jet stream, which could have an impact on migration patterns, and, in turn, a negative impact on bird populations.\n\nI\u2019m so curious about why bird populations have faired so much better in the wetlands. Aren\u2019t wetlands interspersed in all these regions, even the regions where bird populations were hardest hit? Perhaps, wetland birds are better adapted to changes in climate.",

This is most likely due to deforestation and populating new areas. Our effect against the environment can lead us to endanger American birds. This can also mean other animals too. For example, wild buffalo went from the millions into just over 1000. It will be sad if we lose an American animal.\n\nI wonder if there are ways to reverse this effect on the bird population.

The opposite is happen in these other places  and is even worse than 15 percent. For example, in the Grasslands, the bird population has decreased by 50 percent which is the biggest hit shown on the graph. By this data, I can infer that birds are going extinct over in the Grasslands. I can tell that the same thing will happen over in the other areas, that birds will be going extinct if whatever going on continues. We will need to fight for these birds because they cannot. If we don't do anything, than these poor innocent birds will die and the bird population will go extinct. What I really am wondering is what's going over on the Wetlands.

The wetlands is the only area on the graph to have gained a percentage of bird population (over 10% gained). I wonder why some areas suffered a greater loss in population than others, and what environmental factors could have sparked this change? Possible title: \"Feathery Friends Face Fearful Losses\"",

The Wetlands were the only place to increase and Greenlands was the most to decrease. I also noticed that 600 million birds have died, but the most death of birds is from the Greenlands.

Upon doing some research, I found that the leading factors behind their decline are collisions with glass, pesticides, hunting by domestic cats, and by human hunters. This means that out of these 4 leading factors, 3 of the cause are inflicted by humans. Not only are humans contaminating the environment, but some are also killing birds as a sport. People should be more considerate of the repercussions of  their actions when it comes to these poor defenseless (against humans) animals.\n2. What many people may also not consider is that the decline of bird population is also dangerous for plants. Due to their constant travel, birds serve as pollinators and they spread seeds. If birds go extinct, plants would struggle to reproduce in other areas and eventually a great majority of nature would die off. Considering that bees (which are also in danger) also help to pollinate and promote plant growth, there won't be as many options left for plants to disperse. \n3. I wonder if people consider that instead of using pesticide and destroying the habitats of birds, they could take car of the habitats and let nature take its course. Birds can get rid of insects that are considered pests; it's in their nature. So by aiding the conservation of these habits, they will promote a more natural pesticide: birds.",

This can either include global warming or simply a seasonal temperature change, however; problems such as pollution can also be a reason for the net loss of the bird population.\n2. Why is it just North America and the upper areas of land being shown in this map connected with the data being shown? Are the same results being prevalent amongst other countries and habitats?\n3.

Maybe before they had a usual 50% increase in population, but now it has dropped to 20%.\n3.)

I'm so stunned to see that the arid lands have had a stable population of birds compared to the drastic decrease of birds in the grasslands. I would imagine that since the arid lands tend to be more dry, they would have a decrease in bird population, but that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\n3. To my surprise the wetlands is the place where the bird population migrates and there they are able to breed, nest and shelter. Also human settlement is not popular in the wetlands, instead the human race benefits from the wetlands mostly due to their natural products such as water. So because of the lack of human settlement in the wetlands, that might be the reason why they are thriving in a high percentage of bird population.",

Specifically because of deforestation birds are losing their homes at a rapid rate. Birds that reside in arid lands are losing their homes because of wildfires and as each species loses their homes their population drops and that ecosystem falls apart. I think its important to ember that not only is our planet being destroyed but the environment is crumbling because of it.Losing an ecosystem isn't a small accident it will affect everything  around it. So why aren't we doing anything about it?\n2.Without birds many of the ecosystems you know and love will be gone. With birds declining the populations of insects will be at a new high, although that  won't be for long though as insects main source of food will become scarce. Other populations will have to find new sources of food which will throw off every ecosystem. \n3.What can we do? I think our best bet is to start a campaign that shows the effect of the loss of birds. The effect is significant and we as society should make sure to protect birds because the loss of birds will only add onto global warming and the environmental stress of today world. We need to protect our world for future generations to come and protecting these majestic creatures will be a step in the right direction.We as a society need to make a change and not changing will only allow for more animals to become endangered and maybe even extinct.",

This might be for several reasons such as climate change which causes for birds to relocate to find new and better habitats or also because their current habitats are being converted for agricultural use which removes their nesting habitat.",

The bird population increase in the wetlands could be due to the inability for humans to successfully build on the wetlands, thus humans do not take the habitat of the birds in this area. This allows for the bird population in this area to live naturally and breed in their habitat.",
