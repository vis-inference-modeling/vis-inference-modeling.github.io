Also, we're a world leader in medical innovation which is super expensive, but our healthcare system as it stands makes it well worth the cost due to insane price gouging- which has led to medical debt becoming the leading cause of bankruptcies in America (66.5%).

For example, it is good that our minimum wage is higher than most countries, but we also have the most expensive health care by a mile. We also have the highest cell phone service out off all the countries on that category. Another thing that I notice is that The U.S. Is the only country on the graph that is in all of the categories. However, I wonder if this is because the creator of the graph just wanted the U.S to be in all of them. On the category for annual hours worked, I wonder of is good or bad that we are on the higher end of the category. I also wonder if the categories that show good statistics for the U.S. balance out with the not as good categories. Another thing that I wonder is if health care gets more and more expensive for Americans, how many people will be able to actually afford and pay for it.\nI think that a catchy title for this graph would be\n\"How Well does the U.S. match up?\"",

The only other country that is close to the US cellphone cost is China. I also had noticed that the U.S had way more Health Expenditures in 2017 than any other place, but when it came to wages or hours worked it was average. \n2. I wonder if the dates of each graphs have an impact on one another. For example the Health Expenditures in 2017 for the US was in the range of 16 to 18. Health Expenditures are usually expensive and the U.S is known to use a lot of money in expenditures. I wonder if because the US has so many expenditures in 2017 is why the wage is so average or why the cellphone cost is so high. Maybe the U.S uses those two main things to slowly gain the money they've been spending on those expenditures.\n3. The wages and cellphone cost impact me the most because a teen worker I can see the amount of hours I work and how much I earn. I noticed that the U.S has many expenditures, but still gives Americans average pay when I would think it would benefit us more compared to other countries. The cellphone cost effects me because it's hard to find a phone company that is not overprices. We see this happening everywhere as Sprint is no longer by themselves and actually had to merge with T- mobile. Now people in my community with a cellphone service from sprint now have to be renewed with T-mobile. These graphs shows where the U.S is compared to different places.",

In the graphs shown, the U.S.' cost for cellphone service and healthcare is the highest out of other countries. I can't say I'm surprised by this. I know many families struggle with healthcare prices and it honestly is disappointing to know how much less people pay for healthcare in other countries. I also notice that in the other two graphs, we seem to be in the middle of other countries for minimum wage & annual hours worked. This is interesting in relation to the prices for healthcare and cellphone services, as many other countries have higher minimum wage and lower healthcare. For other countries, I wonder what is causing them to have such low healthcare + cell phone service prices. It may come with consequences, but it truly is fascinating to see how many other countries have lower prices. We seem to have extremely expensive healthcare and cellphone prices and they're constantly going up. I also wonder how this relates to inflation rates. If our dollar's worth is inflating, how do the prices inflate to accommodate this? This impacts me and my community, as some people do struggle with healthcare, especially in this time of Covid-19. I know many families in my parent's work have lost their healthcare benefits and most of their coverage, so I really hope this can be fixed post-virus.

Also, minimum wage is not that much, a lot of workers would prefer the U.S. to be on the right side of the graph. \n2.

I actually know a little about the health expenditures bit, and that's because the majority of drug testing/medical innovation is funded by the government! In addition, insurance prices are sky-high, as are hospital bills without insurance, which contributes to the massive healthcare expenditures. It actually has nothing to do with the debt, and the US's debt situation would actually benefit from a universal healthcare program because there would be a reduction in declared bankruptcies and people would miss far fewer days of work, leading to a boost in the economy!

This impacts my community negatively because the United States charges a lot of money for health insurance, car insurance, house insurance -- literally anything that ends with insurance -- while the average person in my community does not make that much money. I think companies need to reassess how much they are charging for lower income communities and see if they can be adjusted for them. \n4.

I noticed that the first (cell phone service cost-2019) and third (health expenditures-2017)  dot plots show the U.S. above any other country. With the cell phone service cost, U.S. is just above another country, whereas with the health expenditures our nation is clearly an outlier since being far above. The other two graphs, annual hours worked in 2018 and the annual minimum wage in 2018 show the U.S. in relatively the middle of the other countries. It is no surprise that we are in the middle for annual hours worked since our country doesn\u2019t overwork the people with many receiving sabbaticals and breaks. Also, I\u2019m not shocked that the U.S. has the highest cell phone service cost. Our country is extremely attached to their devices and is utilized for many things daily. The healthcare here is high quality and for that, drugs/medicine are costly and for the certification doctors require, they have a higher salary than other jobs. Due to these reasons, the U.S. spends a great deal on healthcare to ensure the well-being of the people. I wonder how the health expenditures have raised in all countries since the current pandemic. Has the annual minimum wage and hours of work lowered with the increase in unemployment?

However, with the number of hours, people work on average annually and their minimum wage, US people have to pay a high price for well-being expenses such as cellphone service cost and health expenditure. The US cell phone service cost and health expenditures are on the high side with its placement being in the last place while annual hours worked and a minimum wage of American people are in the middle compared to other countries. From the graph, the US has the highest GPD compare to the other 42 countries tested, showing that US has very strong economic and high money value. This should further benefit the American people\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nWhy do the minimum wage of US lower than many countries when it is the country with the strongest economy. Is there a way the government can help further raise the minimum wage for the people?\n\nImpact on you and your community?\nWith all honesty, the information presented in the graph has little to no impact on me as I do not work in the US, therefore, am not affected by the work hours or the minimum wage.

I noticed that the United States spends more money than most countries spend. For example, the U.S. spends a lot of money on health care expenses and phone service than most countries do. One thing that I found interesting about these maps is that even though we spend so much money we still have a lower minimum wage than most countries do. You would think the more you spend the more the minimum wage would be. One thing I wonder about the cell phone bill is do we spend more because we give children a phone when they are so young. I wonder how the cell phone bill has raised with the global pandemic because there are a lot more people online and face timing one another.

Plus, our health expenses are insanely higher than other countries. Between all of the countries shown as of 2018, the U.S. works an average amount of hours in the year.

While the nation with the second-highest cellphone service cost is just behind the U.S., there's a large margin between the U.S. and Switzerland in the health expenditures. The U.S. is closer to the middle of the graphs in terms of annual minimum wage and annual hours worked. \n\nI wonder if in any way, this gives an insight into the economic system of the U.S. With costs and expenses so high but having average minimum wages, how many families struggle with paying the bills? I also wonder how the graph would compare if all the stats were taken this year, especially with the pandemic having a huge impact on the economy. Another question I have is why the U.S. doesn't have a universal healthcare policy of some kind like the other questions. In terms of Mexico having the most annual hours worked, I wonder if that relates to how many companies bring their manufacturing out-of-country in order to lower production costs.\n\nThis impacts me and my community because this is something that people face daily when it comes to costs. In addition, many people have struggled with paying bills due to job loss as a result of the pandemic.

Although in 2019 and 2017 the US spent the most, the annual hours and minimum wage fell in the middle in regards to other countries in 2018. I wonder why that is and how the US has higher prices yet the minimum wage is much less. This impacts my community because I live in the United States. If prices are much higher yet the minimum wage is lower, this makes being successful and maintaining a stable job while working a minimum wage job extremely difficult. As time goes on, prices will only rise which will cause future generations to struggle more. \nNew headline, \"American Prices Soar While the Minimum Wage Does Not\"",

As a team, we noticed that the United States spends a large amount of money on health expenditures and there is a disparity between the other countries spending on health expenditures. Additionally, we wondered why the author chose to make a dot plot over another plot which would have been easier to visualize, because since so many of the dots overlap we aren\u2019t able to see where alot of the other countries stand when it comes to expenses. Furthermore, we also wondered why the United States pays the most for healthcare and if this will continue in the future. Will healthcare become more affordable? This impacts our community because it shows that the U.S pays the most for healthcare which is important because if we had better healthcare and paid less for it, our community would be able to afford to get proper medical treatment. Overall, we can see that the graphs are visualizing different expenses people pay around the world and shows where each country stands in terms of how expensive those services are.

I can support my answer by the graph shown in the article and how they compared the well-being and income of each country. Although the US earns a lot less money, I wonder why people work less hours in order to be able to afford the things they need in their life.  I wonder why Americans have to pay so much for cellular data. I wonder what makes some countries more dominant than others in some categories, whether it's because of location or how they run their economy and prioritize some things over another. The impact that this has on our community is that there may be some pole that cannot afford the proper medical care, and therefore may have less opportunities as more of their limited income goes to essential expenditures.  The impact this has on our community is that it controls how much money our country has and what services control that money. This impacts our community because it shows us how the U.S. compares to other countries when looking at things such as minimum wage, annual hours, etc. Our catchy titles are: \u201cAmerican people are lazy and make little money, but have to pay a lot for things!\u201d, \u201cWhere is all your money?\u201d, \u201cWhile Mexico is working working, Australia is swimming in money\u201d.",

The US was approximately in the middle of both the annual hours worked and annual minimum wage distributions. Looking at spending costs, however, the US was by far the highest. It\u2019s interesting to see because cellphones and healthcare are deemed necessary in modern society, but the graphs show that US worker\u2019s wages have not increased proportionally. In terms of health expenditures, US costs were substantially higher than every other country likely being an outlier. I wonder why the US chooses private health care companies over universal health care? As shown, Switzerland had about 5% fewer health expenditures as a share of GDP, using universal health care. The US higher healthcare costs may promote the economy but could negatively impact low-income families. What are the benefits of prioritizing economy over way of life? Why has the US not raised the minimum wage to potentially compensate for these high necessity costs? The impact this has on my community is that in the US, there is an immense amount of pressure to live an expensive lifestyle no matter economic status. We in need of employment, work for minimum wage which companies have kept low. However, companies, in turn, raise prices on necessities such as cellphone costs along with our costly privatized healthcare system.

It appears to be a high outlier. In the graph of cell phone service where the US is also the highest value, it is unlikely to be an outlier since the distribution has a greater spread. Overall, the US has extremely high costs while only landing around the upper middle in terms of minimum wage and hours worked compared to other countries. \nI wonder why health expenditures in the US are so absurdly high compared to other countries. Everyone knows that the US has expensive health care, one example being the insane cost of insulin. However, it seems like not much is being done to fix this issue. I also wonder how these graphs would change if data from past years was shown.\nThis impacts me by reminding me that as a US citizen, I have to work harder than in other countries due to the higher costs of living. As someone who has been though quite a few medical issues in my life, it\u2019s disheartening to see how much of my income will have to go into health care. In my community, people with chronic illnesses or other severe health concerns may be even more negatively affected.\nThese graphs demonstrate how despite the US being a rich, first-world country, life might not be that great for the average citizen compared with other countries.

However, the U.S. tended to fall into the upper half of the graph, regardless of which countries preceded and succeeded it. The U.S. has the highest cellphone service cost and highest health expenditures, but fall in the middle for annual hours worked and annual minimum wage. One thing I wonder is how our dot placement in these four graphs would differ if the same data was collected in 2020, due to how much the economy has changed due to COVID-19. Another thing I wonder is how the other countries that appear on the graph were chosen since only a few countries appear. One last thing I wonder is why the prices for phones, healthcare, and other services are so high when in relation to other countries, our annual income is not as high for how long and hard people are working. This data impacts my community as it shows how although the United States is viewed as a country of wealth and opportunities, that compared to other places, people can end up spending a lot more on services that they shouldn\u2019t have to spend so much on. While it is true that overall, the U.S. is a wealthy country, residents tend to spend a lot more money on necessities than people in other countries.

The annual minimum wage in 2018 is a little larger than $15 thousand, which means that with the annual hours worked being 1.8 thousand hours the annual minimum wage per hour would be about $8.33 if everyone was paid minimum wage.\nI wonder if the graph depicting the annual hours world was calculated with only the amount of hours adult workers work or if it includes teenage/student workers. I also wonder why the average hours worked a day can be calculated for about 6.92 hours a day on a five day work week if business hours typically are 9 hours a day.\nMy town is considered one of those that are typically on the higher-end of the middle class. However, there are several lower income housing in our area. Those people typically work minimum wage of about $15 thousand yearly, families would, and do, struggle to provide for their families, especially with healthcare expenses and cell phone services costing so much in the United States. As a high schooler having to work less hours than the average annual hours, I would make very little money working on minimum wage in comparison to what I need to pay for college.\nThe graphs are depicting how the United States has the highest costing services, yet pays minimum wage workers less than other countries.

Had the countries remained consistent throughout the displays, then the displays would have been more conclusive.\n\nThis data impacts me and my community because the costs for services such as cell service and healthcare are so high in the United States, and in the future, these costs will affect all of us, regardless of our economic status. \n\nIn these graphs, it is evident that the United States spends more money on healthcare and cell services than any other country, while their minimum wage and hours worked is average.\n\u201cU.S. vs. the World: Why do we Pay so Much?\u201d",

The graphs that showed cost all had the United States as the highest-priced nation for the specific graph. The other graphs which focused on information about jobs had the United States in the middle of the graph. Finally, I noticed that the United States is way above the average cost of health expenditures in 2017. It is so far above the average that it would have most likely been considered an outlier. \n\nI wonder why the United States is consistently ranked higher on the graphs than other nations? I also wonder if there is a correlation between annual minimum wage and annual hours worked. \n\nThis topic impacts my community as I live in New Hampshire which just went through/is going through an opioid epidemic where those recovering are in desperate need of medical help. To see that health expenditures are absurdly high when compared to other rich countries is disturbing as it calls into question the necessity of the prices that Americans are being charged. Especially as the opioid epidemic had a greater effect on lower-income communities. \n\nThe graphs compare different rich nations to each other on a number line that is numbered differently between each graph. As the graph focuses on the United States, it is highlighted to better show its location. A possible catchy headline for all four graphs could be \u201cFirst World Countries V. U.S.\u201d",

Where I live there is a large homeless population which is greatly affected by all of this because they can't get a job- even a minimum wage paying job which means that they can't pay for cellphone service or healthcare.

I also notice that we are in the top of health expenditures, and cellphone service costs.  I also notice we are in the middle of hours worked and minimum wage. \n\nWhat do I wonder? I wonder why if our minimum wage is in the middle of the graph, why is healthcare so high? Also, why are our cellphone prices so high? Also, why are certain countries shown?\n\nThis impacts us because we have lower hours worked and a lower minimum wage, but our healthcare is very expensive. This is not good, because many people will not be able to afford healthcare and phones because of the prices.\n\nThese graphs are showing that even though we are in the middle of hours worked and minimum wage, we still are getting charged more than other countries. \n\nHeadline. \u201cAmerica, a free country, but not a cheap one.\u201d",

It used to be that the American Telegraph and Telephone Company had a monopoly on long-distance telephone services. After the original AT&T was broken up, it was split into multiple regional telephone companies called \u201cbaby bells,\u201d which were supposed to foster competition. However, due to lack of updating antitrust laws, these companies started merging again. Now we have four big players in the cell service industry, each of which have regional monopolies. These companies don\u2019t have to provide cell services for customers of other cell companies on cell towers they build. So while people in other countries have relatively cheap cell service anywhere in the country, Americans have generally worse and more costly cell service.

God forbid they get hurt/injured because then they will have to pay crazy amounts of money to get treated. \nThe graphing is showing that although there are many benefits to living in the U.S. the minimum wage, cell phone service bill, and the cost of health expenditures are not among them.\nA catchy title would be \"American Dream or American Nightmare Only Time will Tell\"",

And therefore, depending on how high the employment rates are for a country does that change the annual hours worked. Also, how do American's savings compare to other countries? Our average income and hours worked is average compared to other countries, but our cost of living is more expensive, so wouldn't our savings be less?\n3. Because the U.S. has some of the highest costing things, but not the highest minimum wage means we have to work harder to afford basic services.\n4. What's the real cost of living in the US?",
