The first thing I notice is the drastic drop in weddings from the year 2019 to 2020. It went from 2.1 million to 1.3 million in a year. The most probably and likely answer is that this is because of Covid-19. Weddings are usually very big affairs that many people attend. Many couples probably wanted to wait until the numbers from the pandemic came down. 2020 was the height in terms of the number of covid cases. In the coming years, the graph depicts a huge spike in the number of weddings. I know many people who have held off weddings because of Covid.

I noticed that the forecasts for the next few years increase at a surprisingly fast rate.

Though I also noticed that the forecast shows after the year 2020, weddings will restart to increase and that leads to my wonder of how and what kind reasons led to that forecast. Possibly, there might be an assumption that the pandemic will decrease or people will start to slowly get used to the pandemic and being aware of it as they do weddings, instead of just not doing any weddings like when the pandemic started. Though another question is why the graph predicts the wedding to decrease back again after it restarted to increase. Possibly people might start doing weddings or delayed weddings after the pandemic lessens, then there would be fewer weddings once a large amount of people finishes it all at once.

After 2020, the number of weddings continued to increase, and are predicted to reach a peak around 2022-2023. \n\n2. Why were the number of weddings in 2019 decreasing so drastically if the pandemic didn't reach here yet? \n\n3. I don't think this had a drastic effect on my community. \n\n4. \"Weddings Make a Comback After A Two-Year Process\"",

    "comment info": "Title: Matrimony Madness\nI notice that the graph shows the number of weddings per year (each line increasing by .2 million) along with the year that the weddings take place (increasing in 5-year increments). I also notice that the graph begins with a small rise between 1970-1975 and a more steady rise between 1975 and 1985. Along with those increases, there is also a slow decrease going into 2010 and then a significant drop in 2020, when the pandemic hit. The drop occurred in the peak of COVID-19, and then going further into 2021/2022 has begun to rise back up, almost reaching the pre-pandemic numbers by .2 million or so. During the pandemic, people either decided to wait or postpone most weddings for the safety of themselves & their families. As more things begin to open up and vaccination becomes more widely available, people have begun feeling more comfortable holding the gatherings. The last thing I notice is that the forecast is that in 2023 or so, the number of weddings will greatly increase reaching the point of pre-pandemic numbers. I wonder if the predicted numbers will be accurate, or if the new variants will cause the number of weddings to decrease again. I also wonder why there was a decrease in weddings around the years 1975 & 2010, and if they were just due to the ages around and wanting to get married at that time. The last thing I wonder is what happened to the wedding industry during the pandemic, and how they are readjusting now that things are more normal.",

The number of mar weddings taking place declines in 2020. I assume this is because people were not out meeting each other or gathering together due to Coronavirus. This would be the root of why weddings were not being planned.\n\n2. It seems that in the years to come more weddings will occur. Now, I guess that this will be primarily due to people being vaccinated and feeling more comfortable about gathering for large events such as a wedding.\n\nSomething else I know that impacted this graph slightly was that in 2015, gay marriage was legalized which explains the small rise in marriages. \n\nAlso, from 1975-1985 there was an increase which I would predict was from the ending of the Vietnam War. And, a decrease happened during the early 2000s which I would predict was due to 9/11.\n\nI wonder why there will be another slight decrease in 2022.\n\nA good title may be: Wedding Wars: Coronavirus vs. U.S. Marriages",

The first thing I notice is the drastic drop in weddings from the year 2019 to 2020. It went from 2.1 million to 1.3 million in a year. The most probably and likely answer is that this is because of Covid-19. Weddings are usually very big affairs that many people attend. Many couples probably wanted to wait until the numbers from the pandemic came down. 2020 was the height in terms of the number of covid cases. In the coming years, the graph depicts a huge spike in the number of weddings. I know many people who have held off weddings because of Covid.

Finally from 1975-1985 there was a slight increase possiblly due to the ending of the vietnam war.  \n\nWe wonder why the forecast is projected to go down after 2022. We wonder if the reason for the decrease after 2022 is due to the fact that there aren't a lot of people getting married or if it's due to a shortage in wedding materials. (Flowers, venues, dresses, etc) \n\nThis relates to our community because in around 10 years lots of kids our age will be thinking of marriage or will be engaged. With the coronavirus now being a life factor, will this impact our future plans and decisions on our marriages? \n\nHeadline: Marriage- social reasons or economical reasons?",

So, in order to account for the years in between, they did a step graph which is easier to deduct from compared to a line graph. The second thing I noticed was that the number of weddings in 2020 dropped drastically. Of course this was due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the inability to gather with others safely. However, after around 1987, the amount of marriages is generally decreasing. \n\nI wonder why the number of weddings in the United States is decreasing. Is it because the value of a wedding is no longer desired? Are people still getting marriage licenses without having a wedding? Is marriage in general just not important to people anymore?

Though, it is very surprising that even with the huge drop, there will still around 1.2 million weddings, as most of the world was to be in lockdown. We also noticed that there is quite a bit of regular fluctuation. The graph does not seem to be very linear in the increases or decreases.\n\nThough we understand the huge drop in 2020, we wonder what happened around 1975 and 2008 where there were some drops. Were there any specific factors? We also wondered if some of the decreases were due to less social pressure around marriage? Back in years like 1973, it was very normalized and pushed to be married, but now, in 2022, a lot of people choose to not be married but still be together with someone. So we wonder if this has any factor?\n\nThis relates to us and our community because we were able to spark conversation about marriage and how the wedding rates have changed over the years. For example, in our group we talked about how one of our group members mom chooses to not be married, while another member has divorced parents with a step parent, and the last member has married parents. Overall it was extremely interesting to talk about weddings and how each of us and our families feel about them. \n\nOur catchy headline is: Will you marry me? Weddings over the years.",

We also wonder what months are the most popular for these weddings to occur. Around 2025, we noticed there was a beginning of a decline which makes us wonder if COVID-19 has deterred more people from getting married or if other factors(such as societal norms) that are going to cause the decrease.

Obviously 2020 decrease of weddings can be related to lockdown and people not be able to host large events.

Maybe, more people have taken up online dating during the pandemic or more marriages have felt apart after working and living together in quarantine.

Many people have needed to reschedule weddings and other important events due to the pandemic but I have also seen a huge surge in online dating around me in the older generation.

Fluctuations, in the numbers align with major events at the time such as the 1973-75 recession and the 2008 financial crisis. However, in 2020, there is a drastic drop in the number of weddings held that year due to the cancellation and postponement of wedding plans in accordance with COVID safety protocols. Perhaps a cause could even be the pandemic preventing people from meeting and developing their relationships. The number of weddings begins to climb the year after and spikes to all-time highs in the next 2 years due to the number of people unable to hold their weddings in 2020.\n\nI mainly find myself curious in the quick resumption of weddings after 2020, as COVID was still going strong then and was and is a persisting problem. Lastly, I find myself curious in the reasoning behind the predicted decrease in weddings from 2023-25 and onwards.\n\nThis relates to me and my community because I think people are all aware of the obstacles the pandemic posed, especially in its first year, toward weddings, but it's shocking seeing its extent and the spike in weddings afterward seeing with a graph and numbers. People have had to cancel weddings and make sacrifices in their size in 2020 and years since.\n\nIf June is the best wedding month, is the post-onset pandemic the new ideal wedding time? The trends and patterns leading up to this reality.",

This was probably due to strict COVID regulations as well as the lockdowns that restricted people from gatherings. It's interesting that in all other years, wedding numbers have generally been consistent with no other significant changes from year to year. I'm wondering why wedding numbers were a bit lower in 1975 and around 2010. In addition, I find it interesting that forecasts are saying that numbers should dip in 2025. This makes sense as there will most likely be another wave of the virus, but I was also thinking that couples who may have held off their weddings in the last two years would want to hold them in the next few years too. This graph relates back to me because I know of a couple family friends that have postponed their wedding because of the pandemic.

My mother is a teacher and has been for the last decade. Many of the students she had once taught are now young adults, some of which are getting married. The majority of the weddings have happened amidst the times of COVID-19. Most of these people are choosing to either postpone their wedding or find a way to safely have one. Many opt for eloping, or even a virtual wedding. \n\nWill weddings be up and running post-COVID?",

This is because of the Pandemic and everything got shut down. People were supposed to stay in there homes unless they went grocery shopping or were doing something outside (like biking, walking, running etc) I know many people who had to post - pone their weddings because of Covid-19, or had very small ones. I think the reason people started having weddings again is because we have learned more about COVID-19. We now have a vaccine, and I think this really has helped a lot. I think a lot of weddings have a requirment for a COVID-19 vaccine, and maybe a mask mandate depending on if it's inside or outside. Now that we know more about COVID-19 I think this is why people are beginning to feel safer to do things with people. Get vaccinated and wear your mask!",

You may want to calculate the approximate decline in the number of weddings.  Would this significantly show on a graph with the y-axis starting at 0?\n\nInteresting to compare the number of weddings to the population.  This would be weddings per capita.  Would you use the total U.S. population or some subset of the population?",

However, I also notice that after this increase, they are predicting it to drop to the lower side of the average weddings per year.\n\nI wonder why they are predicting another decrease in the number of weddings. Does it have to do with COVID and the prediction of another outbreak? Or, is it because people were not able to meet others during the lockdown and possibly they are expecting a decrease due to the average time period of dating before marriage lining up with when quarantine began? \n\nI personally had two family members' weddings that were pushed back due to COVID. They both occurred over this past summer, showing the major increase in real life.\n\nCatchy Title: \nWeddings on Hold",

This is most likely due to the pandemic and the CDC's decision to limit social gatherings in order to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 virus. The graph stays fairly consistent in the years prior to 2020. Between 2020 and 2025, the wedding forecasts seem to work their way back up the normal average of weddings in the United States by year, which seems to be about 2.2-2.4 million. This is most likely a direct result of the mask-wearing protocols as well as the vaccination distributions. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why there was a peak of weddings in the United States in the year 1985.
