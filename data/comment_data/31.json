This information is displayed in the graph to the left, and there are two distinct lines per age group, one regarding tobacco products at large, and the other specifically concerning e-cigarettes. I notice that while the use of any tobacco products has increased for middle schoolers in 2017 from roughly 4% to 7% of students, the use of any tobacco products for high schoolers has significantly jumped in 2017 from about 19% to about 27% of students. I see that the line describing the use of exclusively e-cigarettes is identical to the upward trend of the line depicting the use of any tobacco product, which makes me thinks that e-cigarettes are the major contributor to the growth in consumption over the past seven years. Perhaps this is the obvious question, but I wonder why this is? I have a hard time coming to any solid answer to this question. Also, what could the government do to deter the continuation of this pattern? A month ago, I heard in the news that the FDA is working on banning popular flavors of pods for Juuls, a very popular e-cigarette brand, that students might find appealing, such as mango and mint. How else could the government aid this situation? Is the federal government\u2019s intervention constitutional?",

This was shown at a consistent rate of about 25% between the years 2011 to 2013. For E-cigarettes, the rate of use was at about 2% between the years 2011 to 2013. Suddenly the use of E-cigarettes increased greatly around 2013, and the use for tobacco products plummeted. I can assume that for whatever reason, E-cigarettes were highly marketed and almost replaced tobacco-related products. E-cigarettes were possibly marketed as the healthier option which led young consumers to try it for themselves. The data for middle schoolers showed the same results as the high school data, but tobacco products stayed with consistent use at about 8%. E-cigarettes then jumped from 1% use and slowly started inclining in 2013. With both data though, E-cigarette use starts to go down in 2015. This is probably because of new findings of all the chemicals that turned young consumers away.  In 2017, both graphs experienced a great increase. I think this was because of increasing popularity with E-cigarette brands such as the Juul. A title for this graph may be \"E-Cigarettes Are on the Rise, But Why?\"",

What\u2019s going on in this graph is it compares E- cigarettes to other tobacco products and compares them between Middle and high schoolers. What we can infer of this data is the middles schoolers have a steady increase, more of an increase in e- cigarettes. The high schoolers have had a major increase in E- cigarettes and gradual increase in the other tobacco products. This graph explains that over the years the amount of products sold and used by these kids has greatly increased.",

On the graph, it shows the percentage of students using this product in high school and middle school. The percentage for high school students had very much increased. Middle school has gone up a little bit.  I wonder how these products have affected students. Especially in middle school. In 2011, the percentage of students using e-cigarettes was pretty low.  I wonder how this percentage increased over the next 7 years. For middle school, e-cigarettes have also increased. Not as much as high school. I wonder how the percentage of these products have increased over the years. I also wonder what might happen in the future with the usage of these products.  The tobacco usage for high school students has been up there in percentage for the last few year. The tobacco usage in middle school has mostly stayed the same for the last few years. I wonder how tobacco products have stayed the same in percentage in usage for the last few years for middle school and high school. I also wonder if tobacco companies put something else in their product to make students more addicted  to it, and want to use it more. From he info on the graph, both tobacco and e-cigarettes have increased in the percentage of students using these products in middle school and high school.",

That may or may not be true judging on certain perspectives and experiences. One of the things that mainly stand out to me is when the year 2017, the rates of both vaping and smoking tobacco among the middle schoolers and high schoolers raised. Though the e-cigarettes seemed to raise just slightly higher than the others. Parts of this graph make me wonder why there was a peak in vaping in 2015 but instead went back low which confuses me because nowadays it doesn\u2019t seem like vaping has gotten less popular. The thing that may be going on in this graph is that many people have flooded to vaping as a better option but at the same time people are using tobacco way more.",

Through the years children have gotten more and more involved with drugs as time goes on. When the first piece of data is presented (2011) kids in middle school rarely touched drugs, but recently that number has skyrocketed. In 2018 a little over 20 percent of kids used E-Cigarettes, but now that number has gone up to 30 percent. In a couple of years, the number will get much larger.

About 20% more high schoolers seem to be getting into these products in relation to middle schoolers. As I see the consumption of tobacco products and e-cigarettes growing each year, I wonder, why people in high school would choose to to put their health at risk and the appeal behind it?

The total percentage of high school students that use stays steady for about a year, where it rests at about 20%. This percentage dramatically increases in the year of 2018.

However, tobacco products have had a major decrease in high school students, but the increase of e-cigarettes increased dramatically.  I think this may have to do with the ease of obtaining these devices and the flavors of juice that target young adults.  I think regular tobacco also isn't as \"popular\" because there aren't as many advertisements as vapes.  Another popular reason may be because they're so easy to hide. With more e-cigarette companies coming up with even more designs, the ease to bring it places and hide it from teachers in school as become senseless.

It seems as time continues more and more students continue as well. It also seems like an ongoing trend and I doubt this trend is going to end anytime so. Since these products kids are using are addictive they will have a very hard time stopping. Society today is a lot different than before in a lot of ways.

First, I saw that there is a large jump between the amount of middle school aged adolescents who have used tobacco products and high school aged adolescents who have used tobacco products. Second, I noticed that the prevalence of the use of E-cigarettes was quite low, until 2013, where a considerable jump occurs. Third, I noticed that the lines for any tobacco products, in both middle and high school aged adolescents, continue with seemingly no change before 2011, indicating that tobacco products, like cigarettes, had been used by students before the graph starts. I wonder about what other tobacco products have been recorded in the making of this graph. I also wonder how accurate the data really is, considering may students may lie about what tobacco products they have used. The story this graph is telling is that, after some fluctuations, E-cigarette and overall tobacco use is currently rising among adolescents. My headline to accompany this graph would be, \"Tobacco Gets a New Disguise in E-Cigarettes!\" This title, which doubles as a claim, is supported by the fact that tobacco use has recently decreased in products other than E-cigarettes (You can tell because the distance between the solid and dotted lines has recently decreased), but overall has gone up.",

I imagine that many students may lie, if asked about their usage of tobacco products by a teacher, administrator, or someone from the CDC (the source) that they do not know. So I wonder if the true percentage of students that use e-cigarettes (and other tobacco products) is actually quite a bit greater than that shown here.",

The first thing I noticed about this graph is that in high school, there have been some significant decreases during the year of 2016 and 2017. Another thing that I noticed was that in middle school there aren\u2019t any big increases or decreases which means that the amount of tobacco and e-cigarette use hasn\u2019t changed much. Something that I wonder is if during 2016-17 the school did something to make the decrease in tobacco and e-cigarette use so drastic. The story that this graph is telling is that there are a lot of different kids that are in school that are using tobacco and cigarettes. It also can show you how addictive these things could be. A catchy headline for this graph could be \u201cToo Much Tobacco\u201d.",

What I thought was interesting about this graph was how one tobacco product (e-cigarettes) compares to all the other ones, were they are on a sudden rise in usage to middle schoolers and up.\n\nWhat I wonder about this graph is why e-cigarettes are getting so popular at high schools? The reason I think it really is a wonder, is because of how much it rised in 7 years compared to other tobacco products who have always been high on the charts for the past 7 years.\n\nWhy I think it might be on the rise to beat the other tobacco products is because of how kid friendly their products are. I think this because of how they have their wide variety of flavors, and how people see it less harmless. I think a catchy title would \"Your Kids are at danger without knowing it\".",

This graph makes me wonder how many of those students want to stop or if they want to stay hooked on vaping and smoking and that stuff. For most people this is a really emotional subject because they either want to stop and can't or they know someone who has had consequences from doing this stuff when they were young and now regret it as they get older. What might be going on in this graph is as more and more people do get hooked they are increasing the percent of students and people.

In high school that's a whole nother story, an average 20% of students vape and all other sorts of tobacco use. I find this very sad because tobacco can screw up your life, out of 150 students at a high school 30 of them vape or other sorts of things.  I wonder how so many kids get a hold of vapes and why they think its cool to vape. In the graph, I see dramatic inclines and little declines which is really bad for our community and victims. The headline I thought of was \"You might want to check if your kid is a victim according to this graph\".",

I would state that drug usage in those years was average but as the years continued the drug usage did as well. It grew slowly but steadily at times though there was another drop in the year of 2016-2017 as 2017 ended the drug usage did the opposite. Drug usage also started to grow in Middle Schools, I noticed there was a drop at times but the drug usage was growing. I wondered why the drug usage was still going up. I wonder why nobody did anything to put a final stop into the drug business. What\u2019s happening in this graph shows how some people took the decision of killing themselves with drugs. It also shows how many people were peer pressured into doing this horrible drug. A  title could be \"Death is growing, as drugs are\"",

    "comment info": "Tobacco Problem:\nAfter seeing this graph, it is very sad how people might notice that when they see a cigarette they know not to take it. As for when they see a vape or a juul they think that its not gonna harm anyone because it is supposedly \"cool to vape.\" I wonder why people change so fast just to think that an electronic device isn't harmful when they know deep down it is going to harm you the same way a regular cigarette does. I also wonder why people go into this stage. Most people are most commonly following the \"trend\" but is it because of peer pressure too? In this graph it seems as if middle schoolers are following the steps of high schoolers because it is hard to transition from being a little kid to a grown up so I lightly think that middle schoolers are just trying to think they are so grown like the bigger kids so they are going to start doing what those bigger influencers do. Which is Vape. As the graph tells us, by 2011, about 25% of the high schoolers already smoked a cigar but also at the same time of 2011 most of the vape did not increase. It did for sure increase by 2014 and had a downfall going from 2015 to 2016. That slightly was a platoe and starting to go up from 2016 to 2017 and now standing higher from 2017 probably to 2019",

This graph shows the active increase of students from middle school to high school in the years of 2011-2018. In year  2011, students from middle school had about 3-5% using e-cigarettes. Although in high school, it was already in the near 30%. For both e-cigarettes and any kind of tobacco product, there was a drastic increase as the years went on. For example, 2015-2018. \n\n I wonder why there is such a huge increase to tobacco products used by students in high school and middle school as the years go on. What is being encouraged to have this change? We all know that high school is a way to try new things, express our emotions, etc., but why is there a big difference when years pass on progressively? Peer pressure is a huge factor, and maybe young adults get ideas from other places as well like the news. \n\nThere are many factors as to which concerning of what might be going on in this graph. Like I recently said, with news today, and all of these rampages, we start having idea flow through our head. For some kids, maybe smoking might be an easier way to forget about their lives and not focus on anything. It could be family issues, we never know.

Something that I wonder about this graph is why does high school have such a huge change through the years for both the tobacco products and the vaping products but when you look at middle school it really hasn't changed at all because middle school is close to high school why doesn't it have the same results or at least similar results to the high school graph? What this graph is saying is that high schoolers are apparently getting more enjoyment out of vaping rather than tobacco as you can see with the spikes near 2015 and the increase near 2017-2018. Middle school doesn't really change but they seem to like vaping better than tobacco also.",

However, as a high schooler, I know that vaping and use of other nicotine or tobacco products (from Juul to cigarettes) by teenagers and college students is very popular, and that addiction is rampant.  I think that the use of E-cigarettes has contributed to the percentage of students using tobacco and nicotine products because they usually produce a less pungent odor and have sleek and discreet designs, making them more attractive to young people.  \nIn accordance with attraction to the so-called clout and attention that vaping brings to young people, these products are incredibly accessible to teens and pre-teens despite the purchasing age of 18.

So, I wonder why \"juul\" was not included in this graph, and where that line would lie. Considering the FDA recently banned mango pods from being distributed aside from what has already been produced, I feel like is a pertinent addition to the graph. Perhaps the author of this graph wanted to show that any tobacco product- such as Juul or chewing tobacco- surpasses e-cigarettes. 25% of high school students partake in some sort of tobacco product, while about 8% do so in middle school.

Initially, in the years 2011-2013, general tobacco usage was on the decline - E-Cigarettes are just introduced, but comparing the downwards overall slope to the E-cigs slope I assume that means there was no Tobacco presence therein. After 2013, E-Cigarette usage sharply increased, but as the total Tobacco usage didn't increase as heavily I'll assume this was the period in which more tobacco usage was comprised of E- Cigarettes. No clue what happened with 2015-2016, but the slopes of E-Cigarettes then and after are fairly consistent with those of tobacco products, although the percentage begins to comprise a larger part of the whole.\n\nTherefore, I've determined that the easier access of E-cigarettes has made them the most common form of Tobacco product! There isn't much else to say, really. I uh... I guess 1/3rd of High School students still use Tobacco in some way, shape or form. No real surprise.",

The number of high school students using e-cigarettes, or \"juuls\", has increased from about 2% to about 21% from 2011-2018. Additionally, the middle school percantage of e-cigarette users has increased by about 5%. This statistic does NOT surprise me. I've seen so many teenagers around me vaping, and it's sad as they soon become addicted to nicotine. Teenagers don't realize that though they may look \"cool\" or impress their peers, they are placing themselves on a dangerous path. Other tobacco products have been on a steady pace for middle schoolers at around 8%. High schoolers, on the other hand, appear to have stopped using Tobacco products between 2016-2017. However, they are now on the rise again with about 27% of students using them. Though we are unsure of the health risks that new tobacco technology entails, we know that it is not good for us. However, the companies that sell them are certainly having a good time.",

In 2011 E-cigarettes were not very popular in either group of students. For both high school and middle school students, the percentages began to increase at a greater rate until 2015. The next large increase came in 2017- most likely a result of the release of the juul E-cigarette. This product was originally marketed as a \"cool item\" and its advertisements included young adults, even though it was intended to be a device to help adult smokers eventually quit. The advertisements have since been changed, but the original affect on teens and tweens could not be reversed. Overall, the use of E-cigarettes has increased dramatically accounting for about half the percentage as any tobacco product.
