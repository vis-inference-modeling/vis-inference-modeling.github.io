It is only a prediction of what might happen but it is quite interesting how everyone doing our part can help.\nI claim that if we do our part for the COVID 19 elimination then we can save lives. The information that supports these is that when time passes there are about 15 million less infected, 2 million less hospitalized, and about 1 million fewer deaths. \n\nI am curious about what interventions and how many interventions are calculated for this to be the rate of decrease. I understand that it refers to closing school, public places, and giving medical aid/support. However how many people need to be responsible for these actions and what other actions can help. \n\nThis graph shows the help intervention can make, that is why my title is Hold on and Intervene.

I am curious about why the numbers of infected went down very fast and the rate of dead very slow.  I wonder what happened to all the persons that were infected, did they recover or died? In the graph we can see the line of infected going down very fast, and that is what we expect, everyone following the rules and due to this, number of cases are much less. If I would add a title to the graphs it would be \"Everyday LESS of Them Thanks to US\" because what we want to obtain is that every day there are less infected people, and the only way this can happen is if we stay at home and follow instructions, in conclusion I mean that if we help staying at home, there will be less infected persons.",

Many places around the world are beginning to lift lockdowns, and I\u2019m very curious if we will see another surge of covid-19 cases. I think that it would be hard to keep the lockdown going until they find a vaccine, because many people say that it could take around 18 months to produce, however, I\u2019m not sure how we\u2019ll be able to safely reintegrate without a vaccine.",

I also noticed that after 42 days of intervention there were very little infected and there were only a few hospitalized and deceased. Over the longer stretches of intervention you can clearly see that the curve was being flattened and there were also less deceased when you get above 21 days of intervention. This shows that the social distancing and being careful does end up helping. This means that it is important we keep with it to get this pandemic under control.",

After 42 days of intervention, the number of infected cases dropped down to less than 5 million people. The numbers changed dramatically, especially the number of infected cases. According to this graph, we can claim that social distancing and lockdown is the most effective method to control the spread of the epidemic. When there are less infected cases, the number of hospitalized people and death cases will also decrease and hospitals will not be overloaded. \n\nI wondered what made the government didn\u2019t make social distancing mandatory sooner before the circumstance became worse.

It appears that with only 7 days of interventions, there is one very distinguishable peak in June with the start of a secondary peak in April. This secondary peak continues to develop while the interventions increase and eventually, a third peak appears to start to develop which may happen in November. This increase in peaks causes the initial distinguishable peak to stretch and approach a further date in time. the distinguishable peak also tends to lose its distinguishability as it flattens, or decreases in amplitude. This shows that the overall infected population, while mostly remaining constant as a sum over time, will decrease in magnitude for each value of time. I wonder what the graphs would look like if the infectious and recovery periods were to decrease. I also wonder what would appear to happen if, rather than the period of intervention all be continuous, if it were to be split up into sections with an equal total amount of days of intervention. This would probably be irrational and ineffective however it still is interesting if it were to happen.

After every seven days, it appears that the curve of infections decreases dramatically. Therefore, one can argue that the interventions that are being currently being practiced, like social distancing and curfews, have been extremely effective. The more we follow these protocols, the faster the coronavirus will stop spreading. \n\nI wonder how accurate this graph is because a statistic recently came out that says that half of the test results that came back negative were most likely positive. Therefore, this could have been a result of more spreading because these people would not be as careful since they thought they did not have it. Also, many people cannot afford the tests or get their hands on one, so it is difficult to know the exact number of people infected.",

Return on late Thursday afternoon to get the link to the original article that included d an interactive graph that lets you use a slider for the number of days of intervention.  Drag the slider to an intervention period of 1 to 90 days.  The resulting graph shows the number of infected, hospitalized, and deceased people for that intervention period.  Below the graph, there is a sentence that gives you the number of infected people and infected people at the peak and number of people deceased for each intervention period you selected. \nThere are limits to the accuracy of these numbers.  This is only a model and not reality.  In addition, many other variables, known and unknown, will affect the size and timing of Covid-19.  Also, be aware that this model only estimates through October.

They use these assumptions: length of intervention varies (7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 days as shown on graphs), intervention starts on March 26, intervention level is aggressive, weather is medium warm, infected people transmit the virus to 2.5 other people, hospitalization rate is 10 percent, and death rate is 1 percent. Other assumptions include incubation, infectious and recovery period, time to death, and delay to visit hospital.\nIf you click on \"email me when my comment is published.\" you will get a link to your response.

The light red shaded portion reaches far less than 10 million people in the graph with 42 days of interventions. Additionally, I noticed that unlike the graph with 7 days of interventions, this graph suggests that there will be a resurgent of cases. \n\nThe viewer can infer that as the number of days of interventions increase, the number of cases and deaths will decrease.

That is a great point, we can decrease the number of cases and do everything that we are instructed to do, but the vaccine might be what needs to be put into place. If we had to wait for a vaccine, scientists are saying that it will probably be another eighteen months before there is one which means another year and a half or so until we go back to things which I don't think would happen. It still might though!",
