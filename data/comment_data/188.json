This is important because a party's background and experiences will affect the laws and programs they support; for example, Trump will most likely support businesses and entrepreneurs in his campaigns due to his background as a private business owner. Kamala Harris is more likely to support government funding and social workers as a use of tax money and resources since she has a background in  government work and being a public prosecutor.

It's interesting to compare their education and career paths; for example, when looking at the data, Vice President JD Vance went from Ohio State to Yale Law, while Tim Walz's career journey shows military service and education before his career in government. I also noticed that while most candidates studied different fields, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris both have economics degrees. Tim Walz stood out for not having a degree in either economics or political science. These factors may affect the candidate's decisions; for example, someone with a business background may focus on economic development and entrepreneurship.

Donald Trump stands out for his extensive time in business before turning to politics which was more private, while JD Vance also has significant time in private service compared to Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Harris has dedicated much of her career to the public, including roles like District Attorney, Attorney General, and eventually Vice President. Meanwhile, Tim Walz's career shows a mix of military service and education before entering government.\n\nHow do different career paths influence political perspectives? Is more time spent in the private sector versus the public sector impact a candidate's policy priorities? How do candidates with military experience, like Walz, compare to those without such a background in terms of leadership and decision-making.\n\nThis relates to me because the graph shows how diverse backgrounds can bring unique strengths to leadership roles. An example is someone with a business background may prioritize economic development and entrepreneurship, while someone from the public sector may have a deeper understanding of policy-making and law enforcement. As a voter, understanding these backgrounds could help inform my decision about which candidate best aligns with the values and needs of my community.\n\n\"From the Boardroom to the Capitol: Comparing the Career Paths of the 2024 Presidential Candidates\"",

Overall, everyone except Trump has a solid background in politics, still trump was a Television personality for a while.\nFirst of all we need to understand that the president is not a supercomputer that carries all decisions, rather a country's representative on the international arena. Most of the \u201cexecutive orders\u201d are not created by the president, and only on the final stage signed by the president. So we need not only consider the president, but also his team. The Vice president is not a whole team, thus the data chart lacks this information. Despite the president being the most powerful human in the counturi, still presidential power is limited by the senate, congress etc.\nStill, the president must be rational and well-educated.

But Tim Walz definitely seems to stand out due to him not having any a degree in Economics or political science. Also while looking at this graph it shows that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have much experience in politics until showed at age 69 where he ran for president. Unlike the other candidates who seemed to have prior political experiences before running for president or vice president. \nI wonder due to every candidate taking different paths to get to where they are today and looking at their background how does that affect their credibility as a candidate? \nThis relates to me because I have recently just turned 18 so now that I am at the age that I am allowed to vote I need to do a lot of research of which candidate I should vote for and who is the best pick for the country. \nHeadline: \u201cBefore and Now of our Candidate\u201d",

Your observation about Tim Walz not having a traditional political science or economics degree is intriguing\u2014his background in education and the military may bring a unique perspective to the table, emphasizing service and community over economic or legal expertise.

All except Tim Walz, who seems to be a more odd candidate with a social science degree and a master's in experimental education that sets him apart from the other candidates.  He was also a teacher for a while, which is also another distinction Walz has.  While that is odd, it is ultimately fine.\n\nHowever, the bigger thing I found interesting is that everyone here has a master\u2019s degree or a doctorate, but not Donald Trump.  That is interesting; we have all heard his economic plan critiqued by Komala Harris during their interview where Trump talks about immigrants eating cats, but I took Komala\u2019s remarks about his economic policy as simple jabs that would happen during the campaign.  However, she also has that same degree in economics which makes this an interesting debate over whether the economic policy of Trump would work or if it is unsupported by modern economics. \n\nFurthermore, seeing as a major like Political Science isn\u2019t on Trump\u2019s list of Bachelor\u2019s degrees and is on Harris\u2019 list does give me more of a sense of trustworthiness than she had before.\n\nLastly, a catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea could be \u201cExperience of Our Candidates: Lifetimes of Learning and Practice\u201d\n\n(never claimed to be a good title maker, or a good writer for that fact)",

Donald Trump\u2019s career stands more than the other candidates because of his focus in business and media and with his entry into politics only later in life. Contrastingly, JD Vance, has a relatively shorter timeline in both the private and political sectors, with key milestones like his military service and venture into politics occurring more recently. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz both have long careers in public service, with Harris holding multiple legal and political roles, culminating in her current position as Vice President. Walz\u2019s career also spans various public service roles, including teaching and serving in the military, before moving into state and federal politics.\n\nI wonder how each candidate\u2019s career timeline will affect their voter base and political strategy. For instance, how does Trump\u2019s prolonged business career impact his approach to governance compared to Harris\u2019s extensive legal and political background?

Kamala Harris has pursued many careers in the Federal government. In contrast Donald Trump has focused his career around business. The republican party has been involved in many private sectors, while the democratic party has been involved in the Federal government. I wonder if the president Donald Trump used his knowledge in business to help himself win the past presidential election. His previous careers have revolved around business, was that his plan all along? To gain skills in business and then use it to become president?

I wonder how Donald Trump was able to become a presidential candidate and become President in 2016 despite not having formal education in law according to the timeline. What other qualifications did he have to meet to achieve this? How did the career choices of the candidates influence their political positions and their choices? \n\n3. There are various ways these could affect communities. The past education and experiences of candidates could influence their positions and their choices in federal positions. These factors can directly and indirectly affect the way the US would react to future events, be it war, economic downturn, etc. The background experiences and knowledge of the president will determine the course of their actions, which in turn affects our communities.\n\n4.

It also surprised me that the progression of each candidates career is so vastly different from the other. For example, Tim Walz was an educator before getting into politics and Kamala Harris was an attorney. Donald Trump was also a businessman and a television personality for his entire life before doing anything political. I wonder what prompted Donald Trump to run for president despite having no experience in the political field prior to that.

Harris has the most experience working for the federal government than the other candidates. She has the same law degree as Vance. She was the attorney general of the 5th largest economy in the world, the State of California and has ran to be a presidential candidate before. Walz has a lot of higher education, like Harris and Vance. He has a very high military ranking while also being a public servant in the National Guard.

In general, the graphs show a timeline throughout their lives and the different decisions they made on what they wanted to focus their lives on.

He spent this time as a businessman and television personality. I also noticed that Kamala Harris spent by far the most time in public service and politics. JD Vance and Tim Walz spent time in the military, while the others didn\u2019t. They may have had varying careers, but they all were successful which shows you success in politics can come from many different backgrounds.\nThe main thing I wonder is why Donald Trump ever got into politics. He was completely established as a businessman and television personality, so it's interesting he switched his career route to become the president of the United States. I also wonder how Kamala Harris' experience in law could influence her. I also wonder why Tim Walz got into politics after focusing on education for so long. \nThis impacts me and my community because it shows the candidates and their vice presidents\u2019 backgrounds and career paths.

It appears as if his \"major career moments\" are twice the length compared to that of his running mate, J.D. Vance. I also noticed that each of the candidates, except for Trump, has some public service in their career. Donald Trump is the only candidate to have previously served as President, which is his only example of \"public service.\" I also noticed that both Republican candidates have degrees from Ivy League institutions, while neither of the Democratic candidates do.\n\n2. I wonder since Donald Trump has no level of public service besides serving as the President, if he is any less \"qualified\" than any of the other candidates. I also wonder what could be considered the real \"qualifications\" and necessary background experience to be President. Vance and Harris both have juris doctor degrees, and Tim Walz has a master's degree in education, while Donald Trump has only a bachelor's degree in economics.\n\n3. This has an impact on my local community as they decide who they are going to vote for in this very divided election. On a larger scale, this will affect the entire world as the U.S. decides the candidate they want to represent America. This has to do with our policies within our own country and who we choose to govern ourselves, but also who and how we choose to represent our country in all its greatness.\n\n4. \"Road to the White House: Major Milestones of 2024's Presidential Candidates\"",

All four candidates attended prestigious colleges, with Harris at Howard University and Trump at Wharton, establishing a strong educational foundation. However, their career trajectories diverged significantly: Trump built his brand in real estate and entertainment, while Harris rose through the legal and political ranks, serving as Attorney General of California. Walz, with a background in education and military service, transitioned from a schoolteacher to a U.S. Congressman, whereas Vance's journey is rooted in venture capitalism and his memoir on social issues. I wonder how these varied experiences shaped their leadership styles and policy priorities. This resonates with me because, as an American citizen, I want leaders who possess the knowledge and experience necessary to govern effectively and prioritize the well-being of the American people.

Candidates such as Kamala and Tim have been far less recognized through the media yet speak more to our generation via social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram.\n\n2. Tim returning to school after five years may reveal a respect for lifelong learning so crucial in today's rapidly changing world. The quantity of higher education is nothing compared to how applicants apply their knowledge and experience. Kamala changing careers might show she's versatile and open to exploring what she's truly passionate about, which can be inspiring for young voters who are still figuring things out.\n\nYou are right; it could well be the next election that would bring huge change in the status and structure of our state and country. It is really important that we, as future voters, contemplate on how these candidates' policies will affect issues super important to our generation: education, climate change, and social justice.\n\n4.

    "comment info": "I notice many interesting things in this graph, mostly each candidates background. Trump, the oldest candidate, has been a businessman all of his life, creating more money wherever he can, taking multiple TV stints for the same goal. JD Vance, the youngest candidate, has spent most of his life in law, and then politics, after he graduated. He lacks the most experience, although his experience certainly does not discredit him by any means. Kamala Harris has spent all of her life in law as well, climbing up the ranks into politics after almost 20 years in the field. Finally, Tim Walz. He, like Vance, has spent ample years as a serviceman. He has worked personable jobs like being an educator, and he has been in politics for a long time. \n\nI wonder, from an outside perspective, if being someone who has had more political experience, yet doesn't necessarily understand what average American life is like, is more or less appealing than somebody who has lived the average experiences, but has had less major political roles and ability in the past. \n\nAs an American citizen, it is imperative for me to have a close eye on our leaders, for any decision they make, affects my family and I. Many Americans, especially ones of similar age to myself, tend to not understand the great power these leaders hold, and how much they affect our well-beings, but this election could very well determine things like our ability to bring food to the table. \n\n\"A Look In The Past May Decide America's Future\"",

Many Presidential and vice presidential candidates have had many jobs in their lifetimes. Former President Trump has been a businessman and a Television host, while his vice presidential candidate JD Vance has spent most of his life as a lawyer and a Marine. Democratic Candidate Kamala Harris Has been a prosecutor and an attorney while Tim Walz has mainly been a US representative. I noticed that while Donald Trump did not have much experience in politics, he was still elected president and is seen as a very good president by some people. I also noticed that Kamala Harris has had many years of government experience, which may help her if she is elected president. I wonder if what the public thinks about the different backgrounds of the candidates. I think that if you are good at your job, your former experience does not matter a whole lot, but on the other hand, having experiences before your presidential campaign can help you exponentially. We are all affected by the outcome of the election. Our personal beliefs and opinions are on the line and the next president may either support our beliefs or not.

    "comment info": "1) The first thing I noticed that Donald Trump studied at Fordham University and then at the University of Pennsylvania and got his bachelor\u2019s degree. But, all he did was be a businessman for 36 years, which doesn\u2019t really justify why he was elected president in 2017. JD Vance, who is 37 years younger has much more experience than Trump. Kamala Harris, has plenty of experience, as she has been from an attorney to even a prosecutor. Finally, Tim Waltz, who might have a chance at Vice- President because of his experience  being younger than Trump.\n\n2) I wonder... Do other candidates have such low chances of getting elected that including them in this graph was pointless? I wonder why Donald Trump got elected in 2017? Finally, I wonder if this graph will be helpful to any of the candidates. Will it help them get elected by people who have more experience and know how to handle stuff better? Will Kamala Harris not get elected even though she has much more experience and professionalism than Trump?\n\n3) This relates to me and my community because whoever gets elected from this timeline is going to determine the future of America. The elected president will determine if the U.S. will continue to be open for people to come and make their dreams come true. This affects me and my community because our lives in the next four years depend on who wins.

These ages correlates with career moments in their lives, which are categorized by color. The length of each box represents the duration of the career moment in the candidates' lives. Not only this, but the candidates listed on the Republican ticket have extensive practice in private sectors - Trump especially. On the other hand, both candidates on the Democratic ticket have more experience in the public service or politics and federal government. I also notice that Tim Walz's major career moments starts at 17 as a U.S. Army National Guard serviceman. Additionally, both Presidential candidates and Walz started college at the age of 18, as opposed to JD Vance, who started college at the age of 23 after completing military service. \nI know that Walz was a teacher and high school football coach, but I wonder why he taught in China for a period of time and what lead him to that. I also wonder why the graph indicates that Vice President Harris is 60 turning 61, when she is 59 years old.\nThis relates to my community because I am a citizen of the U.S., where the Presidential election will take place in November.

I believe that this shows that the bar is a bit low for a businessman or a person who was on live television to be able to run for president. But the biggest thing I noticed is that one Trump was able to become a president without doing all that much. I feel like and I believe that other people feel like that there was a lack of political expereience for Trump that could've been what led Trump to attain 34 felony charges and some other things that could be held against him such as the fraud and the hush money.

We noticed that nothing on the graph overlapped, but there were gaps between different jobs to signify time passing. We wonder why the data is in this format; we think it could be more concise. This topic will significantly impact us as it is a graph of who will run our country for the next four years. Along with this, Tim Walz is from Minnesota, which is an essential detail because he is from our community.

Then he randomly ran for president in 2016 because he had grown to be a popular individual across TV and magazines. Which I feel is what got him most of his popularity. \n\non the other hand we Kamala who went to college for political science and economics which is already saying to everyone that she wants to do something related to politics/government. She then went on to be a deputy district attorney in 1990, she did that for 8 years and then switched to a prosecutor in 2004 for another 6 years, and after then she went back to being a district attorney, and finally to a US senator. This entire time she had been doing something for the country and government. \n\nhow does this affect me and my family?\nmy family wants someone who has as much experience dealing with the people of our country and as much knowledge as possible.

Trump went from being a college student at Fordham University and the University of Pennsylvania to owning his father real estate company for 36 years. Walz on the other hand served in the U.S. national guard until 2005, attended Chadron State College and many more things that are worthy of acknowledgement. Kamala Harris and Walz have been in the political space for almost the same amount of time while JD Vance doesn't have much experience as everyone else but still an important figure for Trump's campaign. \n\n2.

Does dabbling in various other lesser business ventures qualify you to hold the universal title of \"Businessman\", or was he purposefully trying to be perplexing on purpose for some undisclosed reason?\n\nI wonder why both Mr. Vance and Mr. Walz include a \"Candidate for: _____\" section to their career history before receiving their respective roles in political administration, while Mrs. Harris has no such section before the \"US Senator 2017\" section of her career history.  I'd assume it is because it took both Vance and Walz over a year to secure their individual roles, while it must've taken Harris considerably less time, a time which serves no prominent purpose in the history of her career.\n\nThe career backgrounds (especially that of political careers) of these individuals greatly affect not just me and my community, but all communities throughout the US, and probably most parts of the world.

Another interesting event is Vence and Walz were in the military for a while.\n\nwhat do you wonder? \n\n-I wonder, because of what they have to offer what do people think is better to better oath of election and how might this benefit to shape the country? \n\nHow does this relate to you?\n\n-This relates to me, because it\u2019s shows some thing that in the people in my community, state and around me are voting for election day which determines who becomes the president and its background knowledge \n\nCatchy Headline \n\n- Path of careers taken by candidates 2024.",

That does not seem to be what these candidates have done.  What do you think would be the best experience for someone to be President or Vice President of the United States?",

    "comment info": "1) What do you notice?\n\nAfter analyzing the graph, the graph reveals a clear difference in experience between the Democratic and Republican nominees. The Democratic candidates, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, have much more background in public service and government roles. Harris has served in several positions in the California legal system and Congress, while Walz has spent time in education and the National Guard. In contrast, the Republican nominees, Donald Trump and JD Vance, have more experience in the private sector. Trump had no prior political experience until his 2016 nomination, and Vance, though he served in the Marines, didn\u2019t get involved in government until he became a senator in 2021.\n\n2) What do you wonder?\n\nI wonder how their different career paths might shape their policies and approach to governing. Does having more civic experience make someone better suited for leadership, or does experience in the private sector offer a better perspective?\n\n3) How does this relate to you and your community?\n\nThis graph relates to my community and I because it makes me think about the different paths people take to become leaders. Seeing how much experience the Democratic nominees had in government before running for higher office is pretty eye-opening. As a 17 year old it open my eyes to details I should look into before voting next year.\n\n4) What\u2019s going on in this graph?\n\nExperience Gap: Comparing Civic and Private Sector Backgrounds of Democratic and Republican Nominees",

What a great comparison between the candidates from the two parties.  \n\nI have another suggestion as to how to compare the candidates.  How diverse are their experiences of each candidate?  Being exposed to many different experiences may be very useful.  Of course, the details of their exposure is not included in the timelines.",

Though JD Vance did not run concurrently with the other candidates.\nAs to say to this graph Mr. Donald Trumph must  have gone school during his career goals with a lot of reputations he had. He was a Philanthropist and a tycoon  who could run the country despite his misdeeds he had on him.\n\nIn summary Mr. Donald Trumph leads the most  base on the graph as the presidential candidate as he went to school with his reputations and  he had more  career fields more than Mrs./Ms. Kamala Harris and the others.\n\nIt is quite explanatory graph that details the facts base on the four candidates with their respective career goals they had.",

    "comment info": "This graph shows a stark contrast in experience between the Republican ticket and the Democrat ticket. The Democrat nominees have much more experience with civic duties. For example, Kamala Harris served in many different roles in the California Legal system - even becoming attorney general - and congress. Tim Walz dedicated much of his life to educating the future generations and served his country as a part of the U.S. Army National Guard. Compare this with the Republican nominees, who have much more experience in private enterprise and were much less involved in the civic duties, with Donald Trump only working as a businessman until he became the Republican Nominee in 2016. JD Vance served in the Marine Corps during operation Iraqi freedom, however was not as involved in governmental affairs following his service and until he became a senator in 2021. Overall, the graph shows who has more experience when it comes to helping American and understanding the American system of governance\u2039. Presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Vice Presidential nominee Tim Walz have much more experience with serving regular people and have a much more in depth track record when it comes to serving our country.",
