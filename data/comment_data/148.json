I notice that more graduate students take online courses full-time when compared to other college levels, but most of the data for all college students was centered around a mix of both online and on-campus.  The data mimics that of a normal distribution which is surprising to me because I would think since COVID and the adaptations we had to do for online learning would sway the data that way.\n\n2. I suppose there is no way to truly know, but I\u2019m curious how many students would have chosen online learning if the pandemic hadn\u2019t occurred.  Are they only choosing online learning because they became used to it or are there other underlying factors?\n\n3. Many of our students still take courses at the physical campus because we only live an hour away from the more popular schools \u2013 Minot State & BSC.  There are still a few who take online courses so they can still work on their family\u2019s ranch/farm.  As for adult learners, they take online courses because they need to work and/raise their family.  Personally speaking, I wouldn\u2019t be able to work full-time and travel to the campus and I\u2019m only taking one course.\n\n4. \u201cIs On-Campus Learning A Thing of the Past?\u201d",

We do see an increased number of graduate students taking more online classes. This is largely in part because there are a lot more graduate students working full-time jobs while working on their degrees. I do not think this number is anything too new.

For adult undergraduates, we see a larger amount of students completing online courses, again, this is not without a healthy mix of in-person classes being taken.

This isn't very surprising because a lot of masters classes are geared toward adults who have full time jobs and cannot come to campus. The way undergraduates are  structured is that there are more in person classes during the day time because most people attending ungrad. are full time students who can attend an in person class. What you see in adult undergraduates is that they tend to take more online. This seems to be because they might already have jobs and so they might sign up for online if given the chance.",

Not accounting for covid and the shift to fully online school during lockdown, a lot of colleges were advertising online courses for adults that could not make it back to campus, they would be able to schedule their own courses. Now accounting for covids reach on education, we could see another spike in a variation of covid sending college students back or colleges giving students the option for health reasons. \n\nI wonder if rates on colleges change depending on whether it's in person or not. More so considering the amount of attention graduate students need regarding their work, from what I've heard from my teachers, some graduate level courses have as many as 15 students in a class. The amount of \"intimacy\" at those levels being lost could result in people potentially arguing that college admission should be less.\n\nI'm graduating June of 2024 and I'd be going to college fall of 2024-spring of 2025, this would affect me because if this is a choice that I have to make it could alter my future and the futures of my peers.

The majority of undergraduates who are conventional age stand out since they receive the majority of their education on campus. Only 9% of this group's members are primarily online, while only 2% are completely online. The percentages for online instruction significantly increase for the adult undergraduate segment, reaching 32% for the majority and 9% for the entire course. With the greatest percentages of 34% majority and 17% totally online education, graduate students are anticipated to receive the least instruction in person. This demonstrates how graduate students are more inclined to enroll in online courses.\n2.The major question I ponder is whether enrolling in online courses for graduate students is necessarily simpler. What would this graph have looked like before the pandemic drove schools to become virtual is another thing I ponder about. How education will change in the future and whether \"conventional\" college experiences will no longer be available. Did the pandemic cause any changes to this?\n3.Because I'll be attending college the next year and am concerned that many of my classes will be online, this has an influence on me and my community.

This is the complete opposite for grad students where over 50% will take classes majority or fully online. While adult undergrads are in between these 2 categories, adult undergrads have the most variety in the data. \n2.I wonder how this data would compare to 10 or 20 years ago when there were much less advancements in technology within education. I also wonder how this data may compare in 15 years as technology advances, will majority of traditional undergrads be fully online? And will the option for fully on campus education disappear? I wonder if graduation rates differ based on how college courses are taken? For example is there a higher graduation rate for grad students if their courses are taken fully online? \n3.This relates to me and my community because as a senior in high school college is the next step for many of us.

By 2025, most traditional-aged undergraduate students will spend the bulk of their time at college learning on-campus, with 40% of that total number of students taking a mix of online and on-campus coursework. In comparison to the other two groups, graduate students have a much greater percentage of entirely online students. \n\n2) This makes me wonder if companies believe degrees obtained online are less legitimate or worthwhile. I'm also curious how much of this is related to the rising income disparity. Is it true that more people are going online since it is more affordable? I'm curious if the prediction made by 271 online officers is an accurate representation of all online officers at all institutions across the country. I wonder if the results of the graph were influenced by COVID-19. \n\n3) It is relevant to my community because how students experience college influences how many individuals are able to obtain a college education. More people in my town will be able to get a college degree as online learning becomes more widely available, providing my community with more people capable of doing tasks that need a college education. Perhaps a larger percentage of students will find themselves graduating because of the potential future of college.\n\n4) The Future of College Education: Is Learning From Screens Inevitable?",

The total number of responses were 271 from 4,700 college and university chief online officers. I've noticed that both completely online and completely in person are low percentages. The vast majority  of classes were the majority on campus and some online for traditional-aged undergraduates. Then a balance of online and on campus for both adult undergraduates and graduate students. I noticed that this was an estimation for what college classes look like in 2025.\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder what every college does to determine whether the class will be in person or online. I wonder if the location takes into account whether they are online or in-person. Along with how the students perform in comparison to others. Which group of people are more prone to succeed and which allows for the students to work more. \nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to my community and I because my school is fully in person. I'm unsure if we even offer an online option for when students get sick but this is reality. Majority of the world has to go through this which is the aftermath of the pandemic. Being the class of 2024 it affects me as I will be in college the same time class of 2025 is. \n4. Aftermath of the pandemic: Colleges exceptions of remote and in-person instruction",

I also wonder why adult undergraduates and graduates chose to being online due to them having complicated lives because they would be taking care of a new family of theirs or they would be living by themselves while also taking care of school work compared to the traditional aged undergraduates who would be somewhat still being taken care of by their family.",

I think as years pass 2025, colleges will most likely lead to being fully online and wont be able to make much money since majority of students will not be on college campuses. Reasons why I believe this may lead to a downfall is due to internet access, experience from COVID, housing, and different learning experiences. During COVID, there was a massive impact on students doing classes online. Not only the student life was being affected but their personal life such as mental health. If people agree to doing online for college, would high school lean to being online since they live by \"preparing for college\"?",

As far as the impact online learning could have in the future, a lot of things could happen. It could allow for rural internet access, or it could lead to advances in technology.

By 2025, for traditional-aged undergrad, only 4% are predicted to have fully on-campus classes. For adult undergrads and graduate students, the percentage is even less for fully on-campus classes, 2% or less. The trend for classes is going towards a balance of online and on-campus and the majority online. \n\nI wonder if the shift toward online classes is a result of COVID-19. This was not something that many colleges offered previous to COVID. I wonder if this will provide more access to schooling for people who may not be able to live on-campus or commute. I also wonder if this will affect things like tuition. \n\nThis relates to my community as I am starting college in the fall of 2023. This means I will be graduating college in 2027. It seems that it is highly likely I will have some online classes. \n\nCollege Learning: Technological Takeover",

The majority of college classes for traditional-aged undergraduates are on campus, with some online, and the least amount of classes being fully online.

The adult undergraduates and graduate students seem to have more classes online than the traditional-aged undergraduates do.  I wonder if students prefer online classes or on-campus classes?

It relates to my community because as a Junior in high school, I'm a person who is getting ready to go to college. I should know what I'm in for. I notice that in this graph there seems to be an association between students and how much time they spend on campus.

Traditional-aged undergraduates make up the bulk of students on campus and in certain online courses. Graduates have a higher possibility of being completely online than the general population.\n\n-I wonder what schooling might look like in 20 years. Will it evolve into a virtual society?.  It also piques my interest how the tuition amounts will appear dependent on different modes of learning.\n\n-This is relevant to my town since many of the people presently are going to attend college, including me. Many potential students will need to start thinking about how they want to approach the college route, and this graphic provides them with an indication of what their experience would be like. Technology advancements are influencing everyone, and college will not be the last.\n\n-The future of education: online vs. on-campus, who will win?",

However, 40% are expected to have an even balance of campus and online courses. This is only 4% less than the majority of students on campus, with some online. As the levels of learning and age increase, the more hybrid and online options appear to be anticipated. This makes sense because many adult undergrads and grad students may need a job and be unable to live on campus. They also might want to live off campus because they will be older than most of the traditional-aged undergraduates. It might be easier for them to take classes in the evening or around their working schedule. I wonder why some students prefer online learning over in-person learning. I wonder what hybrid learning will look like in the classroom and how it will affect group work for college students.  Thus affects me because I will be in college in 2025.

I also wonder what the 271 chief online officers based their answers on and why they believe that more graduate students would prefer online instruction than traditionally aged undergraduates \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to my community and I because there are many seniors who plan on going to college and some of them may prefer to be instructed fully online while others may want a traditional college experience and be instructed in-person on campus.\n\nHeadline\nA Virtual Revolution: How College Classrooms Will Look By 2025",

I also noticed that graduate students are the ones who rather have mostly online or fully online. For all the groups, the amount for the majority on campus, some online is almost the same as the value of a balance of campus/online.\n2. I wonder why for the traditional-aged undergraduates, the amount of all the categories does not add up to 100% but the other groups do. I also wonder if graduate students prefer online classes because they are able to balance their work and school better than having to go to a campus. \n3. This relates to me and my community because the school I go to, many of the teachers that are trying to obtain a higher degree all prefer online classes instead of going to campus during the night time. An example is also my sister because when she takes online classes, she is more able to get things since she is not wasting time in driving back home to start her work but being a traditional aged undergraduate, she would fit into the people that agree with majority on campus but some online.\n4.

The highest percentage for fully on-campus was 4% for traditional-aged undergraduates, a very small number. \nThere also appears to be a statistically significant difference between the projected percentages for the different types of students, suggesting that there is an association between the type of student (traditional-aged undergraduates, adult undergraduates, and graduate students) and how the student is expected to experience college. \nFurthermore, it appears that traditional-aged undergraduates are the more likely to experiences college on-campus, as the percentage of this group projected to be fully on-campus, majority on-campus, and a balance of campus/online are all greater than those percentages for the other groups, while the percentages for majority online, some on-campus and fully online are both the lowest out of all the groups. Potentially, this could be because traditional-aged undergraduates do not, generally, have full-time jobs and other outside commitments that would prevent them from attending school physically. \nI also notice that this study is limited by nonresponse bias, as only 271 responses were received from a total attempted sample of 4,700, and these people, who were willing to respond, likely have stronger or differing opinions from those who did not respond.",

About 44% of traditional-aged undergraduates students favor the majority on-campus, and some online option. About 40% of traditional undergraduates favor a balance of on-campus and online option. About 36% of adult undergraduates favor the balance of on-campus and online option. And 33% of graduate students favor on-campus and online option. \n\nThere's an association between the grade level and the types of classes they'll take because the percentage of statistics doesn't match up with the segmented bar graph.\n\nThe data relates to my community because most senior high school students are in the process of applying to and waiting for acceptance to colleges. And this data matters because everyone has different preferences and priorities, which means their college schedule has to work around their time and choices, despite the college\u2019s requirements to graduate.\n\nMore undergraduates and graduate students tend to favor attending the campus in-person and online.",

    "comment info": "This graph demonstrates the possible appearance of college classes in the near future.  There is an interesting array of future possible experiences.  The main thing that sticks out is how the traditional-aged undergraduates have the highest percentage for mostly on-campus instruction.  For this group, only 9% have majority online with a mere 2% fully online.  With the adult undergraduate section the online instruction percentages greatly increase to 32% for majority and 9% for fully.  Graduate students have the lowest in-person projected instruction with the highest online percentages of 34% majority and 17% fully.  This showcases how it is more likely for graduate students to take online courses.  The main thing I wonder is if it is necessarily easier for graduate students to take online courses.  I also wonder what this graph would have looked like before the pandemic forced schools to go virtual.  Did the pandemic prove that online instruction is easier than one would think?  This affects my community and I because almost all students across the nation have experienced online classes so it is necessary to understand whether or not that will be the case in college.  I would entitle this graph: \"Future of College Classes.\"",

We can also see that there is an association between education level and the prediction for their class types. Further, I notice that this data cannot be used to determine class types only predict those class types. We know this because this is an observational study in the form of a survey rather than an experiment. \n\nI wonder if predictions are based on calculations or are predicted based on qualitative observations. I also wonder if the expected information has been skewed or biased due to the events of COVID-19. \n\nThis relates to me and my community as many students in my community are heading into college soon and I will be going into my first year of college in 2024-2025. \n\nThis graph could be titled \"Hybrid in Higher Education?

    "comment info": "Based on the graph, as students get older & decide to get a high education, there is a more likely chance that they learn or pass their chosen degree online. It could be shown as you compare the fully online section, for traditional-aged undergrads (freshly out of high school), they only have 2 that participate fully online, for adult grads they have 9, then for graduate students have 17. It gradually increases as they get older.  The factors that may cause this is having a family, they may not being able to balance going on campus more often due to having to take care of them (regardless of age), along with other responsibilities (jobs & bills). \n\nThis relates to me & my community because we are entering the age where we have to look for desirable colleges & picking what we may want to pursue as a career. Depending on what we want to do, there may be only certain things that may follow with that particular degree, the availability of it being either online, on campus or a mixture of both. That may make an impact on what people may strive for & how they may learn overall. I have seen firsthand how that may impact how well someone may do. As someone myself dealing with online & on campus. \n\nA good title for this graph may be \"The Evolution of Online Vs. On-Campus Learning\".",

So is this information based on their personal views and observations or on previously documented data taken about online compared to in-person campus? It also doesn't explain how they decided for the percentage pertaining to the majority on-campus and balance, are these 75% to 25% and 50% to 50% or some other division? It also gives an idea of how college campuses will look for students just going into college and may lead to some colleges eventually downsizing their facilities due to the fewer number of people it would have to hold.

Graduate students appear to have a more balanced schedule by shifting from online to on-campus, despite spending more time online than their counterparts.\n\n2) I'm curious if the fact that adult undergraduates and graduate students spend more time online and appear to have a more balanced schedule than traditional-aged undergraduates is due to the responsibilities they have as working adults with families and other extreme commitments outside of school. It's easy to see how being online could make this lifestyle more bearable.\n\n3) This is relevant to my community because the vast majority of seniors in my school who are attending college are doing so at a traditional age and prefer to live on campus and experience their classes that way. But when you talk to teachers who are trying to obtain their master's degrees they are most likely always online because they don't have the time or resources to attend campus all the time.\n\n4) THE FUTURE OF COLLEGE LEARNING",
