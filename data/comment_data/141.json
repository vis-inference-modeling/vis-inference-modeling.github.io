This makes me wonder about the cause of this noticeable difference. The data in this graph is actually the opposite of what I believed would be true.

I initially expected these potential difficulties to hinder immigrant children\u2019s economic success, but this proves me wrong. I am a child of two immigrants. My mom is from the Phillipines and my dad is from England.

This is out of people who were born into the lowest 20% of all household incomes in America between 1978 and 1983, so I'm curious if there is a particular reason for choosing this age bracket. I also notice that children of U.S born men have greater percentages in the poor and lower-middle class brackets, but once the middle class category is reached, children of immigrants have the higher percentages. I wonder what this graph would look like if it used people who are older than those in this graph, or what it would look like in the future. I think seeing whether this data remains consistent would help to back the argument in the opinion piece \"Why So Many Children of Immigrants Rise to the Top\" by Peter Coy, where the interactive version of the graph is included.\u00a0\n\nI think this graph is relevant to my community because I there are people everywhere from all sorts of different backgrounds, and often times you don't know everything that someone went through or is going through in their life.\n\nI would title this graph \"Is the American Dream Obtainable?\"",

This surprises me because I would first think U.S.-born children would be more successful because they might understand \"the lay of the land\" better than immigrant-born children but my assumptions are proven wrong by the data of this graph.\u00a0\n\nWonder: I wonder if U.S.-born children tend to be less successful because they might have more to live up to in the sense that their predecessors have started businesses where children could just work rather than attempt to start their own career path. This could set back U.S.- born children whereas immigrant-born children are stereotyped as tireless workers because their parents have come to this country purely for the opportunities and may have no option but to work hard to live and succeed.\u00a0\n\nCommunity affect: As a child of immigrants, I genuinely do believe my parents have different standards and goals for me than some of my friends whose parents are U.S.-born citizens although I think it important to remember that children of immigrants are not their parents.

Children of immigrants generally have more success bettering their financial status. They have higher percentages of people ranging from the middle, upper-middle, and upper class. Children of US-born parents, consequently, are more concentrated in the poor and lower-middle classes. As a result of stereotypes, I believe it would surprise most people to learn that children of immigrants climb the social ladder more rapidly. \nI wonder how connected motivation is to the higher success rates in social climbing in children of immigrants. I also wonder what the main contributed to such high poverty rates is--lack of housing and jobs, addiction issues, family issues, etc. \nThis relates to my community because a large portion of my town consists of immigrants and children of immigrants. In addition, where I live is near some of the most concentrated immigrant populations, like Newark, where a lot of Ellis Island immigrants came to the US to live. \nA title for this graph is \"How Far does US Descent Really Get You?\"",

I honestly did not expect to see that more children of immigrants born into poor families are rich than children of U.S. citizens. I would expect it to be opposite due to the lack of resources and attention to these lower funded and poverty ridden immigrant communities. One thing I wonder about this graph is how big of a factor age is. 1978 and 1983 was a long time ago and these statistics have most likely changed. Being from the Bay Area, my community is very diverse. Most people that live in my community are direct descendants of immigrants, and most were born into a low income family.

I wonder why this discrepancy exists. I'm interested what the children of immigrants do differently or what environment they were reared in that allows them to achieve more than children of American-born families who have been in the nation for a longer period of time and are more comfortable with the American system.\n\n3) Many of the children in the Perth Amboy community are the children of immigrants, and few can trace their ancestors back to the United States. I find it fascinating that, contrary to popular assumption, immigrants are more likely to grow richer or acquire better fortune than those born in the \"land of opportunity.\" It almost feels like they should have the upper hand in that regard.\n\n4) Economic Disparity: Children Immigrants vs. U.S. Children",

The graph shows the economic success of those who were born from immigrants compared to US citizens in this lowest 20 percent. \n\nI wonder why children of immigrants were able to achieve different levels of income above poverty at a higher percentage than children of parents born in the US? \n\nI observe that the percentages of children of immigrants who were poor, lower-middle class, middle class, and upper-middle class were relatively the same. However, the percentage of children of parents born in the US who were able to escape poverty decreased across the income levels. For example, the greatest percentage of children of US born parents, 29%, had a poor income level. This was similar to the percentage that had an income level in the lower-middle class. However, after this point the percentage of children of US born parents who achieved upper-middle class, 14%, was significantly smaller compared to the percentage children of immigrants who achieved upper-middle class, 20%. Similarly the children of immigrants who receive a rich income, 15%, is much greater than that of children of US born parents, 9%.\n\nThis graph relates to me and my community because it represents the difficulty of changing your level of income.\n\nHeadline: The American Dream: Opportunity or Fallacy",

This is true for both children of immigrants and children of U.S. born parents, however the percentages are slightly higher in this category for people whose parents were born in the U.S.. This leads me to wonder if there is a generational correlation between wealth. Does having rich parents make a child more likely to be rich when they grow up? Does having poor parents make a child more likely to be poor when they become an adult? This lack of socio-economic mobility is seen all throughout the country, including my own community. It is quite challenging to be able to break generational economic circumstances.  A title for the graph could be, \"Is the American Dream Stronger than Generational Economic Circumstances?\"",

It compares children of immigrants to children of US born parents.  All of these people are in their mid-30s.  The main thing that sticks out is that children of immigrants who are poor has a much lower percentage compared to children who have parents who were born in the US.  I also notice that the percentage of children of immigrants who are rich is significantly larger.  It would appear that this demographic has had more success.  I wonder what the main cause of this difference is.  It is plausible that the children of immigrants want to be a difference-maker in their family.  They want to demonstrate a desire to achieve the \"American Dream.\"  Children of US born parents may feel they have little to prove and because they were born in America, they feel as though they belong.

This surprised me because Americans tend to have an unfair advantage over non-U.S. citizens. I wonder why there are more rich families that are immigrants than not.

Here's one point- this graph likely doesn't cover all of the U.S, so it's not really good data for the U.S. The header gives the info that this is a smaller group of people- mid-30s who were born between 1978 & 1983 who had a household income in the lowest .2 of U.S. family incomes. This decreases its reliability for a simple average. I notice that this is from people with really low family incomes in their family, yet over 10% of the children of immigrants become rich! That's interesting, since they climbed social classes! 1/5 is Upper-middle class, showing that there is a correlation, according to our limited graph, with children of immigrants climbing classes.

I relate to this because, as a child of immigrant parents, immigrant parents' main goal for their children is to reach success and have a better life as they most likely didn't have much opportunities in their home country. They also expect them to start a career they believe that will make them (the children) successful or that they (the parents) weren't able to do in their said home country.

I wonder why the makers of this visualization decided to use the circles in the back to represent the data as just the percentages provide enough insight and the differences in size between two data groups are not easily discernible.

Although a larger percentage of U.S. born children are born into poverty than the children of immigrants are born into poverty, they have similarly proportionate chances of advancing into the lower and middle classes. However, I noticed that children of immigrants have nearly double the chance of becoming rich compared to U.S. born children. In the case of many second generation immigrants, it is possible that their parents face the large burden of leaving their home country and adapting to a new environment, thus making it difficult to immediately thrive economically. The first generation immigrants\u2019 undertaking of most of the initial struggles of starting new life likely set up their children for greater opportunities and success. To add onto that, I wonder if it would be possible to measure or gather some form of data regarding motivation and the \u201cseizing\u201d of opportunity. I wonder what the distribution of these statistics would look like across different ethnic groups or native countries. It would also be interesting to see which states in the U.S., appeared to lead to greater second generation success.

Immigrants have a 15% chance of being rich, while people whose parents were born and raised in the US only have a 9% of being rich. This is interesting because I would've thought that it would've been the opposite, but apparently not.",

One thing that I did wonder, however, was that since this data was taken from people born between 1978 and 1983, if there might be a significant change in the results of the data in the near future. Do you think that if that survey is revisited in a couple years time, the data would change in any way? I think we might see some differences in the data for second generation immigrants.",

I also notice, unsurprisingly, that the category with the least amount of individuals is that of being rich.\n2.) I wonder why children of immigrants on this chart tend to be better off than children of people born in the U.S.. This might have to do with the fact that immigrants have to work hard in order to lead a stable life in the U.S., and that mentality must have been taught to their children.\n3.) There are lots of immigrants in my community, my own dad being one, and therefore there are lots of children of immigrants.\n4.) Children of immigrants in this study seem to be better off than those of U.S. born parents.
