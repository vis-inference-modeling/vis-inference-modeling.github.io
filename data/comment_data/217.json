I also wonder why it is that the US number of warheads is decreasing over the years at what seems to be a constant rate while Russia jumps from 4,259 warheads to 38,582 and then back down to 4,489 in the same time span.

There is also a second graph that is a bar graph showing the global nuclear stockpile from the years 1950 to 2023. Most nations had their largest amount of nuclear weapons in 1985, but the US had the most in 1963. The obvious global powers in nuclear weapons are Russia and the US. There is a downward trend where most of the countries are decreasing their nuclear stores, except for some Middle Eastern/eastern countries. China is rapidly increasing its arsenal. I wonder why some nations have decreased their production and disabled many of their weapons, and others have increased production. I also wonder what happened in 1985 that prompted the minimization of arsenals, as overall global production hit a peak that year. Maybe the explosion at Chernobyl prompted discussion about the dangers of these weapons?

It shows the progress and change in nuclear warheads throughout the years. I notice the main countries that have significant power are Russia and the United States. I also notice many of the countries have had reductions in their nuclear supplies since the 1900\u2019s. This could be because they used them during wars or have gotten rid of them in other ways. \n    What do you wonder?\n    I wonder the specific reasons that each country's nuclear supplies have depleted? Especially the larger countries like the United States and Russia which have had a significant decrease since 1985. \n    How does this relate to you and your community?\n    This relates to me and my community because I know many countries have nuclear reserves in case of a war to keep their country safe. I also know that it is rare for countries to use nuclear weapons, but this graph answers my questions on why there are less nuclear weapons used even now. \n    Create a catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea.\n    Where Has the Nuclear Power Gone?",

I also notice that America and Russia have the greatest amount of warheads, however Russia has had more the past two years in the chart. In the second part of the graph I notice that the most cumulative warheads from all the countries was in 1986. I believe this is because it\u2019s around the time of the Cold War. I also came to this conclusion because the year of 1986 US and Russia were the two countries with the largest numbers. I wonder why Israel has such little warheads, when they are a country which is prone to war. I also wonder why North Korea has the smallest amount of warheads out of all the countries. This confuses me because Kim Jong Un, the ruler of North Korea, is very bold when talking to countries and they seem a powerful force. However they have an extremely small amount of warheads compared to their competing countries. This relates to my community because the US seems to be the second most powerful. Russia is first which scares many Americans, however this was counted in 2023. A catchy headline for this graph could be \u201cWhich Country Owns Power\u201d",

On the graph with the continents, it is clear that around this time each country had the most nuclear weapons in their history. As time goes on the amount of nuclear weapons drastically decreases. For example, in 1985 Russia had around 38, 582 warheads which then decreased to only 4,489 in 2023. This drastic decrease is similar throughout most of the powerhouse countries throughout the world. \n    \n    I wonder what current events were happening in 1985 causing the warhead stockpile? Also when countries get rid of their warheads, where do they go? \n    \n    This relates to my community because it is important to know and understand current events. If our country, America were to get into a nuclear war, we would definitely be affected. There are enough nuclear warheads to wipe out the entire planet.\n    \n    WE COULD ALL GO BOOM",

Within the graph I noticed that the two states players within the Cold War, America and Russia held the most in warheads around the 1985, and seeing as the dates line up within this timeline, this would make reasonable enough sense as the arms race was brewing within this time. I also notice that amongst all states, there was a decrease in the number of warheads within western or states who have developed easier. While within eastern states or states who developed later in life, there was a growing increase of warheads.\n    2. I wonder why the need for these warheads exist. With a good strategy and one warhead, any state could completely demolish another. So why would this many warheads in anyway be needed. I also wonder why some states are allowed large stockpiles while other is written not to. Lastly, I wonder what a growth of weapons in some states, mean for foreign affairs. \n    3. For obvious reasons, weapons of mass destruction matter to me when those who control the ability to launch one, are not those I see on my day to day. They're people who sit up in high buildings and mutter within dark halls.

However, both countries have been making moves to decrease their supply, so I think these smaller countries have no need to increase their number of nuclear weapons.

Most of the nuclear weapons are held by just two countries the United States and Russia ,while all the other nuclear-armed nations have much smaller numbers. Over time, the total number of nuclear warheads in the world has dropped a lot from its Cold War peak, when tens of thousands existed. Even though the overall number has decreased, some countries, like China, India, and Pakistan, have slowly increased their stockpiles.

The stocks increased until 1986, with amounts reaching over 50,000. However, the two leading nations, Russia and the United States, worked out compromises that resulted in the disarming of many of these nuclear weapons. Today, nine countries hold nuclear weapons, ranging from North Korea\u2019s 30 warheads to Russia\u2019s 4,500 warheads. As I look at the image, my mind immediately runs to South Africa, which was shown to have 3 nuclear weapons during 1985, but none today. The biggest question I have is what forced this smaller country to get rid of their warheads, and why other countries that are much more violent than South Africa have not been forced to give up their warheads. Despite the fact that South Africa has had a violent past due to its long history of colonization, South Africa has recently had a peaceful society, largely due to the work of Nelson Mandela. With these facts in mind, what possible external reasons forced them to give up their weapons?",

I\u2019m reasonably sure that Israel stole some material, even though the official story is that France helped them. Enriched uranium with American signatures was detected in samples taken in Israel right after hundreds of pounds went missing from an American plant (after high-ranking Israeli spies visited it). Israel purposely hoodwinked inspectors by hiding parts of their facilities behind false walls, and also have the Nixon-Meir agreement, where Israel agreed not to declare and the US ignores the existence of their nukes in order to get around the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which Israel didn\u2019t sign. Israel\u2019s policy is the Samson Option, which dictates that Israel will use a massive strike if its military is ever defeated.\n    Their Jericho III missile is capable of reaching anywhere in the world except parts of Australia, the Pacific, and the Americas, but the powers that be do absolutely nothing about it, which seems to be a recurring pattern when Israel is involved.",

China\u2019s expansion of the nuclear arsenal, while concerning, is not necessarily surprising, given the revanchist propaganda which they spread against Westernised nations like Japan.

Some countries have multiple nuclear weapons and even though they can get rid of some, it always leads to making more, even if it is in secret or not.  I agree that it is insane for countries to have multiple nuclear weapons that can wipe out the whole world, making it very terrifying if one was to go off. Instead of having multiple nuclear, we can use the money instead for countries that need it and that are facing food shortages, famine, genocide, no education and more.",

    "comment info": "1. We can clearly see how the situation has changed since 1963. The number of warheads has dropped significantly among the leading countries that produced nuclear weapons during the Cold War. Countries that played major roles in WWII (such as the UK, France, and China, nations allied with either the US or the Soviet Union) now have their own nuclear arsenals, since 1963 or 1985. Their numbers have stayed relatively constant over the years, except for Israel, which has doubled its warheads, and China, which seems to be expanding its nuclear power. There are also several countries today that have recently begun to possess nuclear warheads.\n    \n    2. I wonder whether these numbers show the exact amount of warheads each country possesses. I can easily imagine that this kind of information depends on the willingness of each country to share it. We know how complex nuclear technology is, and it\u2019s well known that transforming or using nuclear-related materials is expensive. It also seems much easier to hide information about nuclear warheads and keep them available for one\u2019s own use if needed.\n    \n    3. As an Eastern European resident, I feel powerless knowing that we do not possess such weapons. It may sound harsh, but entering a conflict without this kind of arsenal immediately puts us at a disadvantage compared to a country that has nuclear weapons. Who knows, maybe some conflicts wouldn\u2019t have happened if both sides had any nuclear power.\n    \n    4. Is nuclear war still a real threat?",

Eliminating nuclear weapons entirely is a difficult goal due to technical, political, and security concerns, but reducing and preventing proliferation is crucial.
