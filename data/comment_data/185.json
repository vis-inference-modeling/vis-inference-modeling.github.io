Something interesting I learned from this graph is how the proportion of each shape corresponding to the different types of energies changes along with its impact or percentage in that year.  So as the percentage of power from a energy source decreases so does its size.  In the graph there is sufficient evidence to say that something happened between the years 2015 and 2016 that caused a significant change in the shift from coal to cleaner energy sources. Other than that we would need more evidence.  I believe that randomness would not affect this graph because of what is given.  The alternative in this article is the mention that the shift from coal to renewable power and natural gas has led to a reduce in carbon dioxide emissions.  This is because they are both extremely related to one another.   I wasn't able to find a null for this article since there wasn't much said and all that was said was related.  This graph used probability by having the use of a energy source be measured with respect to the total energy consumption.",

People in urban areas do not have clean air, and global warming is becoming a huge issue. This graph shows that environmentalists are beginning to acknowledge this so it is good to see that we are beginning to make this viable switch. In the future I hope we reach the point where we can fully make a change to renewable energy.",

For example, coal's starting position from 2001 has a width greater than the starting points of natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, solar, and petroleum because it makes up a greater percentage than the rest. However, as the percentage of coal decreases in usage over time, the width decreases and natural gas takes over by 2017. Additionally, I notice that each power source overlaps each other when there is a noticeable rise or decline in production.\n\n2. I wonder what the light gray section towards the bottom represents because it is easy to tell apart from the white gaps and the rest of the individuals.\n\n3. This relates to what energy sources may be widely used and popularized around the community from 2001 to 2023. It could also predict what energy sources may improve inventions that people will rely on for the future. For example, the graph shows that there is more natural gas which can be useful in furthering the development of natural gas vehicles. Additionally, more natural gas than coal is produced because of its efficiency, affordability, and environmental-friendly option, making it a top choice.\n\n4.

Other energy sources experienced fewer major changes.\n\n2. I wonder how this switch from coal to natural gas has affected the environment.

From 2001 to early 2015 Coal was a major energy source for the U.S. As shown in the graph about 51% of the energy we consumed between 2001 and 2015 was powered by coal. Suddenly there was a shift in 2016 where coal no longer was the main source of energy but rather Natural Gas.\n\n2. I wonder if Natural Gas will decline in the future due to the various alternatives that are more suitable for the environment. If we compare U.S. states and how their main energy source has impacted the condition of the state either negatively or positively, it's possible to find a less harmful or non-harmful energy source for the environment. \n\n3.

It gives us an idea of how much our different sources of energy that we have access to are really being produced to make electricity. What I first noticed was the decline of coal in 2015 and how natural gas skyrocketed. Coal went from being over half our energy sources to now being roughly 10%. Natural gas has completely taken over. I also noticed how little we use solar and wind energy sources. They have increased throughout the years, which is really shocking to see. I wonder why this is. We are living in a such a modern century that one would think our energy sources have become less harmful. Why aren't we using these options which are better for the environment? I also wonder why nuclear energy spiked in 2020 then declined again, and is now shooting up once again. What caused the spike in the first place?  This is very applicable to me and my community.

We noticed that Coal was one of the primary energy sources with 51% and it went down near 2015 we think this is because it is cheaper to get natural gas and it emits less carbon and solar is starting to rise as well. Natural gas went from 17% to one of the most used energy sources because it is easier to access and get hold of also more commonly used now because emits less carbon. Nuclear energy fluctuates it decreases and increases throughout time. Hydroelectric was consistence and started to go down around 2018. Petrolum decreased over time. Solar energy started to increase around 2016 maybe due to more studies on solar energy and efforts to convert to different energies more environmentally friendly. We wonder why there is a switch between Nuclear and Coal because it's going up and down and looks relative to each other maybe they are connected.

While analyzing, I noticed substantial fluctuations contributed by coal, natural energy, and nuclear energy.

On the other hand, petroleum continues to serve as \u201cliquid gold\u201d for the American economy, but it is scarcely used because of its environmental detriments. In the United States, coal has historically been a significant source of electricity generation. However, its share in the energy mix has decreased over the years, as coal combustion releases pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, a recipe for respiratory cancer. I wonder what the safest option for electricity would be regarding financing and the health of the people and the planet. Why are we not utilizing solar power more sparingly? As the third-largest and wealthiest nation in the world, the next step to bettering the well-being of the American people is choosing to spread funding for more appropriate energy sources like wind, solar, and renewable.

I wonder why in 2015 the United States switched from coal to natural gas and why they did not invest in the other types of energy that could have been used.

Natural gas burns cleaner than coal, resulting in lower levels of pollutants and greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. The change highlights a growing awareness and responsibility toward adopting less harmful energy sources. \n\n2) What are the primary factors driving the transition from coal to natural gas as an energy source? Additionally, how have technological advancements made natural gas extraction more efficient, and how does the growing emphasis on sustainability influence how the public feels regarding energy sources.\n\n3) The energy we use, either fossil fuels or renewable, affects the air quality in our community.

Since we notice that Natural gasses increased as coal decreased, shows that they are trying to care for our environment and coal is dirty.\n\nTitle: A Visual Journey Through Power Sources",

I wonder why are we not consistent in using nuclear power, the graph goes up and down fairly often cause if it wasn't a good energy source why use it at all? I also would like to know why don't we use hydro energy as much as the others it would make sense to use it more and it is the most consistent than the other energy sources we have.

    "comment info": "It is noticeable that as coal decreases, natural gas increases. The decrease of the coal used for the production of energy dramatically decreased after 2014, which then led to natural gas to have an exponential increase at the same time. This shows that there's some sort of correlation between the two, since as one decreases one increases. Since there's a decrease-to-increase correlation, it raises multiple reasonable questions. Firstly, what is the reason for this dramatic change? (perhaps it is more efficient to use in the environment) Why is it that as nuclear energy increases, coal energy decreases even more? Is the main objective of using one energy source as opposed to another due to the efficiency of the energy in itself or merely for the sake of the environment?\n\nThis applies to not only my community, but as well as the U.S. nationally.

I noticed that the size of the blocks correlates with the amount of power that is produced from the following sources during that year. Up until 2015, coal was the major energy supplier to the United States followed by nuclear energy. While the use of coal as a source continues to decline, natural gas continues to rise, now making up 42% of the graph in 2023. I also notice that the use of wind as a source of energy starts to rise in 2007, while hydroelectric energy remains the same, solar energy starts to rise, and Petroleum decreases to almost undetectable. \nI wonder, however, why coal has had such a major decline during the same time period as natural gases uprising. I also wonder if this is due to the idea of natural gas being better for the environment than coal and if that idea is truly correct. Not only this, but I wonder why the rate of solar energy remains so low even though it has been heavily applied nation wide.\nThis relates to me and my community as, in my town, solar energy has been heavily implemented.

Since 2015, the production contributions of coal have declined while reliance on natural gases has increased. Nuclear and wind power have also risen; the former eventually surpassing energy produced by coal, and the latter surpassing hydroelectric power.\nWhat do I wonder?\n- Is our current scheme of energy production better or worse for climate change than the scheme of 2001? Are natural gases worse for the environment than coal emissions?\nHow does this relate to me and my community?\n- We heavily rely on energy to support the comfort of our daily lives.

I noticed that nuclear power had been the second most produced energy source in 2001, while it then dropped down to third just to rise back to second around 2022/2023.  The decline of coal must have impacted many companies as well as the increase of natural gas.  I wonder if the world realized the harmful side effects of coal around this time, resulting in the decrease of coal emissions and the rise of the use of natural gas.  I also wonder if nuclear power declined just to increase again; possibly because it is a cleaner energy source.  I also wonder if the hydroelectric, wind, solar, and petroleum energy sources are expensive or not as effective since they are at the bottom 22%.  This relates to my community because many people in my town have recently gotten solar panels on their roofs, which I have noticed in the last year.  This not only helps the environment but is also a turn towards the direction of cleaner energy overall.  \n\nHeadline: \"A Step Towards Greener Energy\"",

Other renewable resources such as wind and solar have started to increase their role. Nuclear and hydroelectric power have remained relatively stable, with petroleum's role in electricity generation remaining minimal. This transition reflects broader trends toward cleaner energy and reduced reliance on fossil fuels. What I wonder is why petroleum no longer has any use and why it never truly had a massive purpose.

Regarding this, I also noticed how coal declined for the first time in 2015/2016 natural gas shot up and stayed up while coal kept rising and declining. I wonder why we as a country do not try and use hydroelectric, solar, and wind energy more often. They are not only less harmful to the environment but they are also renewable resources meaning they never run out. Does it have to do with money, accessibility, or the fact that some things can't be powered by water, wind, and sun?

The graph has coal, nuclear, natural gas, wind, solar, petroleum, and hydroelectric electricity. They all have different colors and sizes. Coal seems to be the biggest, however it declines around 2015. Likewise, natural gas grows in shape at around the same time. Some electricity stays relatively the same throughout the years. I wonder what made the different types of electricity decline in usage. Coal might have become scarce, and people started relying more on natural gas. I see solar energy come out in 2012, so I guess that solar panels were invented around them. Wind energy seems to grow, so maybe people started utilizing windmills as a natural resource.

We also see a rise in wind and solar energy that offers a much cleaner basis of energy. Nuclear energy is on the rise as well. Overall nuclear energy is extremely clean unless there is a natural disaster. Even though we are pushing for safer and cleaner energy, natural gas still seems to be a necessity for our power grids.\n\nI wonder when natural gas will be overtaken by a new energy source. I could see solar energy being the newer power source along with nuclear energy. With time going forth there will be new ways for power without relying on dirty sources.\n\nIn my community, our power seems to be fueled by natural gas. As we go further away, there seems to be a huge growth in solar energy. With fields full of solar panels that move with the sun's rays. I believe that solar energy is the most efficient way to power if everyone jumps on board to it.\n\nThe Fall of Natural Resources? Time for Renewable Energy to Power a new Future.",

After 2014, the use of coal for electricity began to take a steep fall, while the use of natural gas for electricity rose. Natural gas usage in the United States has risen from about 17% in 2001 to 42% in 2023. Nuclear and hydroelectric electricity usage remain approximately the same in 2023 as it did in 2001, but solar electricity usage seems to be on the rise, starting around 2012. \n\nWhile studying the graph, I immediately noticed the large dip in coal usage for electricity from 2014 to 2016. I wonder what caused this dip. Was this dip due to an increase in awareness of global warming? Upon taking a deeper look into the graph, I observed that when petroleum usage declined, solar usage became popular. I ponder what caused the switch from petroleum usage to solar usage.\n\nIn my community, people are realizing the effect that excessive usage of harsh forms of electricity has on our community. Our community as a whole recognizes that we need to try and cut back on our electricity usage, or at least use electricity in a more efficient and environmentally friendly manner. Some ways my community has taken the initiative include adding new solar panels and creating more windmills. When driving into other towns, I have noticed less solar panels and windmills than in my community which suggest that my community is trying to actively lessen climate change. \n\nCoal is Only for Christmas",

I also noticed that natural gas was becoming more noticeable between 2006-2015 and then it grew even more around 2017 and seems to be very favored.\n- I wonder why there was a little spike in 2020 for Nuclear power and why it went back down. I am also interested in why wind is recently more favored than hydroelectric.\n- This involves me and my community because the way we use and consume energy can also affect the world.\n\n- \"The Rise and Fall of Energy\"",

    "comment info": "The first thing I noticed was the rise of natural gas. It was in 2016 when natural gas became the number one energy source. It\u2019s not as big as the coal industry was in 2001, but the natural gas industry still seems to be growing. Also, wind and solar power seem to be on the rise.\n\nWhy did we as a country switch to natural gas? Does it have any relation to 9/11? What benefits do we gain from natural gas? Does natural gas prevent any greenhouse gases? What is better for power in the long run gas or coal?\n\nThe rise of wind and solar power greatly impacts our community. When on I-94 near Marshall, many solar panels were installed in fields. A big company bought the land and has built this solar farm. Also in mid-Michigan, many wind farms have appeared like most of the midwest.\n\n\"The Rise of Clean Energy\"",

It has gone from 17% of power produced for energy to 42%.  That\u2019s huge.  \n\nWhy has natural gas increased in use?  Price.  Fracking.  Cleaner.  Other reasons?  \n\nDo some research to find out why this changed around 2015.",

    "comment info": "1. I notice that coal and natural gas flip flopped in usage over the span of 20 years. Solar appeared soon after 2012 and had some gain above some others. Highest renewable form of energy is wind energy and it is only 10% of all the energy in the U S in 2023. There is much more non renewable energy (Natural Gas, Nuclear, and Coal). It is good though that we are seeing some increase in renewable energy still and at the rate it is going it will keep increasing.\n\n2. Why don\u2019t we try for more renewable? Why isn\u2019t there many laws about renewable energy? Though natural gas may be cheaper why is it used so much even though it is limited?\n\n3. This relates to me and my community because about everyone uses electricity. And not many people know what makes their energy.

In the graph, I have realized that the hydroelectric, wind, solar, and petroleum hovered across the bottom and barely changed or didn\u2019t change at all. \n\n2. I wonder what this graph will look like years from now because as a country we have expanded and advanced in several ways such as technology, so I am curious to see what happens to these sources over time. Also, I wonder why coal decreased so much and what caused it to do so?\n\n3. This relates to our community because these energy sources are what help us run our daily lives.

    "comment info": "1.To begin in 2002, coal was 51% of all fuel sources making electricity, and by 2022 it was down all the way to just 16%, compared to natural gas which in 2002 was 17% of an energy source, while in 2022 it went all the way up to 42%. Wind power also rose by 10%. The longer the source has lasted it gets outdated and people find new energy sources that are more effective.\n2.I wonder where this information came from, I don't think it would be possible to measure everything that put out energy, and also how much would come from that source. I also wonder why the nuclear energy spiked so much in 2020, while the coal dropped in 2020. Lastly I wonder why petroleum sourcing went down so much.\n3.This relates to me and my community because these energy sources are all powering these communities, and making jobs that help communities provide for themselves. The type of power source a person uses can tell a lot, mostly about their knowledge and stance on the environment. Coal and natural gas are okay sources but they put out a lot of pollutants that in a community would make it seem dystopian, while if someone was using solar energy it shows core beliefs in the environment.\n\n\u201cSurges in sources energizing the United states from 2001 to 2022\u201d",

Natural gas has had a steady incline through the years, and currently has the majority energy source usage. Nuclear energy usage went down at the exact same time natural gas went up, and spiked around 2020. \nWhat do you wonder? \nWhy did coal have such a steep decline around 2015? Why did nuclear energy go down at the same time natural gas went up? What caused nuclear energy to spike and subsequently decline around 2020?\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to me and my community because I use energy every day. I rely on these energy sources for my daily activities like keeping the lights on, showering, or charging my phone. It also affects the future of our world, which includes my community.
