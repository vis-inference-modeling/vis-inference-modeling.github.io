This remains quite consistent throughout the age groups. For example, ages 18 to 39 demonstrate the same pattern as senior citizens. Typically, natives and hispanics are very close in death rates. \n\nI wonder if these statistics have anything to do with cultural beliefs. The global pandemic that we endured caught us all by complete surprise. For this reason, there is no preparation for tragedies like deaths that resulted from covid-19. Many different groups of people dealt with the pandemic differently because of their beliefs or morals. \n\nThis relates to me and my community because since it was a global pandemic it affected me personally.

This is because a majority of the land is communally owned, meaning that no one can invest into improving the land or utilizing the often rich natural resources.  The issue of property rights and the risk of making a big investment without a legal footing is unappealing to investors, so those in the reservations are stuck in an endless cycle of poverty. Due to these conditions, tribes are confined to small areas of land to house their large population, so everyone is uncomfortably close together. This boasts some problems for social distancing in the pandemic, causing more people to catch the disease and therefore die. However, in the 65 and older age group, Hispanic people die the most due to COVID 19. I don't know why this sharp increase in Hispanic mortality occurred, but older people are more than 2x as likely on average to die from COVID-19 than their younger counterparts in the 40-64 group. \nI wonder if government funding to Native American reservations during the pandemic could have saved many lives, as well as other low-income communities. \nThis is a wake-up call for many, as this graph highlights the disparity between communities, and how much a low-income status could affect something as seemingly unrelated as their chances of dying from COVID-19. \nThe Disproportionate Effect of COVID on People of Colour",

The truth is that we don\u2019t know where in the world this data was taken from so it could have been from a large population of natives, or a more condensed group, as you said. Yet, I wonder if the data from the Covid death rates were collected in a way that gives the impression that natives are more susceptible to catching Covid, spreading it to other people and dying from it.",

I also wonder how these statistics relate to recorded cases over all as well as overall death rates.\n\n-As a mixed-race Hispanic person, I think of the family members I lost during the pandemic, specifically my aunt who died of an un-Covid-related infection but who had difficulty and apprehension accessing medical services because of the strain and risk involved due to medical centers being highly transmissible places and the limited care available because of the focus placed on Covid-19 cases. Within my family and community there is also a large amount of distrust towards the Covid Vaccine, and other government-recommended medical advice. I can't blame them as while we have made great strides, there is still much racism and discrimination made from people in positions of power.\n\n-Ethnic Endangerment; Covid-19's Effects",

If there were socio-economic factors that could have altered the data results, I believe that the death rate for Natives could be much lower. For example, if the data was taken from a group of natives that were already living in poor conditions and suffered from multiple diseases already, and then caught Covid to top it off, that could possibly change how the data was sifted. Perhaps the analyzers could\u2019ve sectioned off people who were already sickly or had a low immune system and died from Covid  & compare that data to the people who were very healthy until they caught Covid and died.",

On the other hand, the second graph shows Hispanics as above average in life expectancy throughout the pandemic; is that a contradiction or does it tell you something? But beyond that, is there one people group that you think is at the center of attention of these graphs, and if so, maybe you could work that into your headline.",

The second graph on the right shows the average US life expectancy from the years 2019 to 2021, counting for ages 65 to 85. This graph also depends on race or ethnicity. \nHow does this relate to you or your community? \n- This relates to my community regarding COVID.

    "comment info": "What do I Notice:\nThe first graph shows the amount of people who died in the US in in three different age groups: 18 to 39, 40 to 64, and ages 65 and older. Within each of these age groups the people surveyed are divided among five different ethnicities: native, hispanic, black, white, and asian. The second graph illustrates the life expectancy in the US  from 2019 to 2021 among the same five ethnicities. In 2020 the life expectancy of every group decreased. \n\nWhat do I wonder:\nI wonder why the life expectancy of some nationalities were disproportionally affected by the Covid in the US. For instance, the life expectancy for the Native Americans is dropped about 6.6 years from 71.8 to 65.2, while the life expectancy for Asians decreased by about 1 year, from 85 to about 84. \n\nWhat do I notice:\nIn nearly every age group Native Americans have the greatest cumulative US Covid death rates. I also notice that people ages 65 and older are affected significantly more by Covid compared to younger demographics. In every age group Covid-19 had an impact in decreasing the life expectancy. \n\nHow It Relates to My Community:\nThis relates to me and my community because I have lived in the United States throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. It is shocking to see the long-term impacts that the Coronavirus has had on the population.\n\nHeadline: \"Covid-19 Legacy on Life Expectancy\"",

It also divides the death rates and life expectancy by race and ethnicity.  These graphs most likely have a direct correlation as the pandemic began in 2019 which caused a higher death rate.  The main thing I notice is that from ages 65 and older, Hispanics have the highest Covid death rate.  Asian people in this same group have the lowest.  However, in the other two age groups, Natives have the highest death rate.  Another thing that stands out is how the life expectancy among all ethnicities has dropped significantly since 2019.  This makes sense due to the high Covid death rates over the past few years.  I wonder why different races have higher death rates.  It most likely does not have much to do with population of the various ethnicities, so could it have something to do with an opportunity to receive healthcare, or just medical help in general?

The second graph is a line graph with the year as the independent variable and life expectancy as the dependent variable.\n2. What do you wonder? I wonder what some of the causes are for why certain ethnic and racial groups have larger death rates/lower life expectancies than others\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community? My community had to face this pandemic, and it has been noticed that people react to this disease differently than others. Since there is a moderate association between ethnicity/race and death rates/life expectancies, it could be an underlying factor to this observation.\n4. What's going on in this graph? Native people experience the largest number of deaths in all ages 18 and above and have had the lowest life expectancy. Asian people experience the smallest number of deaths in all ages 18 and above and have had the highest life expectancy.\n\nHeadline Idea: Has Covid Affected The Life Expectancies of Ethnicities?",

However, from 2020 to 2021 the race/ethnicity groups stayed relatively the same with the exception of Native whose life expectancy decreased significantly.   \n\n2) I wonder what were the factors that targeted Native, Black, and hispanic. If perhaps it was due to the groups lifestyle or community. Also I wonder if what affected the most was the access these groups had to  resources against Covid, such as masks, gloves, and even information on how to be more protected. I wonder as well why the Native expectancy life continued to decrease between 2019 and 2020 even after all the other race/ethnicity groups either stayed the same or changed (decreased) but slightly.\n\n3)  This relates to me and my community because as a Hispanic person I had many relatives pass away. And these graphs raise the question of what groups are prioritized in America and whether White and Asian people being the least affected by Covid in America is a coincidence or not. Which is a tough but important question because what Hispanic (immigrant) people, like my parents and I, seek for in America is freedom and opportunity and how could we find that without equality.    \n\n4) \"The Impact of Covid in different communities\"",

The graph relates to me and my community due to the fact that the Bay Area of California is a very diverse region with great amounts of every ethnicity listed, and knowing that their populations suffered these amounts of deaths is shocking. Overall, the following two graphs were meant to connect the COVID-19 pandemic deaths to ethnicities and their average life expectancy in the nation, a catchy headline for the graph\u2019s main idea would be \u201cDiverse Deaths.\u201d",

Does wearing the mask affect this?\n3. This relates to my community because we were also affected by the pandemic. We were not allowed to leave our homes, attend school, or live our lives. Because of this the life expectancy for those alive has decreased and those who were predicted to live longer and no longer with us. The elderly who were in relatively good health are no longer with us because of the pandemic.\n4. In the graph, there have been more Hispanic deaths over those who are white or black.

And overall Native deaths are shown to be the highest percentage of deaths to COVID-19.  And the overall lowest percentage of death rates are under the Asian category.  Over on the left side of the graph it shows how the life expectancy for the Native group plummeted from 71.8 to  65.2 over the course of 3 years from 2019 to 2021.  But overall average life expectancy didn't go down that much, it still clearly went down just not as much as some of the other groups.\n\nWhat I wonder:\n\nI wonder why the Native, Hispanic, and Black groupings on the left side of the graph have much higher death rates compared to the White and Asian groupings.  I also wonder why on the right side where groups like Black, and Native death rates got a lot lower from 2019 to 2022 but the overall average for death rates didn't change that much.\n\nHow this relates to me and my community:\n\nThis relates to me and my community because I know people who have relatives who have died from COVID-19 and it has impacted their lives in a bad way.\n\nCatchy headline:\nThe true impact of COVID - 19",

The older demographic has weaker immune systems, so it makes sense why they would be dying at a higher rate.  Is it possible these specific groups are found in closer proximity to other people, cause a higher spread of the virus compared to other groups.\n\n3. My community is majority Hispanic.

Asians have the greatest life expectancy at 85 years, whereas Native Americans have the lowest and steepest linear curve. It is worth noting that each visualization offered has two different sources: the CDC and the National Center for Health Statistics.\n\n2) What additional variables, besides covid, contribute to the increasing death rate of indigenous Americans?

The U.S. expentancy of a native has a larger skew than any other races, even more than the average of all of their U.S. life expectancy combined. It is also the only one that seems to keep going down. I also notice that there is a bigger drop in the U.S. life expectancy in 2020 of hispanics and natives. \n\n2. I wonder why is it that white people are the only ones who had a steady decline in their U.S. life expectancy. I also wonder how the life styles of each person, like what they eat and what exercise they do, affect their life expectancy. I also wonder why there couldn't be more age groups in the Cumulative U.S. Covid death rates in order to get a better idea of the shape of the graph. It is difficult to put together ages 18 to 39 because people of 18 years of age are still growing while people of age 39 have already grown. \n\n3.

This pattern reflects on life expectancy in the United States, where Native Americans have the lowest and Asian Americans have the highest, but all ethnicities are declining, with no one living over the age of 85. Covid fatalities affected individuals 65 and older far more than those younger, with those aged 18-39 being the least affected.\n2. I'm wondering if the fall in life expectancy and the high number of COVID-19 deaths among Native Americans is due to a lack of understanding about the conditions they live in on Indian reservations. Is the lack of medical intervention the primary cause of COVID-19 deaths? Was access to the first three doses evaluated, and if so, was data recorded in locations where it was or was not accessible? \n3. This is relevant to me and my community because, while the area where I grew up is diverse, the population in Perth Amboy is primarily made up of Hispanics.

Additionally, I wonder whether a line graph that shows the overall number of fatalities for each group over time may shed more light on how Covid affects various populations.

Asians appear to have a longer life expectancy; they do not have a greater mortality rate at any age group when compared to the rest of the population. Hispanics are the next in line behind Asians, having a life expectancy that is similar to the Asians. White people's life expectancy is steadily declining over time, which might be attributed to the vast resources accessible to them. Everyone else, save the white population, has a quicker decline in life expectancy, which is most likely attributable to a lack of access to decent healthcare.\n\n-Aside from covid, what other variables contribute to aboriginal Americans having a higher mortality rate? I'm curious why, in the life expectancy graph, a purple line was utilized to highlight native Americans rather than everyone else. \n\n-This is something I can connect to because I lost a handful of individuals I cared about as a result of the covid epidemic.

I notice that on both the COVID deaths and life expectancy graphs, Native Americans are shown to have, by far, the most COVID deaths, and the lowest life expectancy out of the ethnic groups surveyed. I wonder why this is the case. It is likely due to the inequity in access to health care and services that Native American communities face compared to the rest of the United States. I think these graphs may help to understand the severity of their lack of medical resources and show the breadth of the consequences that only grew throughout the pandemic. In people aged 65+, the Hispanic population had the highest COVID death rate, whereas for every other age group it was dominated by Native Americans. Asians were shown to have the lowest death rates across all age groups and the highest life expectancy. I also noticed that of the lines depicting life expectancy, Black and Native life expectancies experienced the greatest change in 2020, despite the other ethnic groups\u2019 curves flattening out. The reasons for this are abundant with nuances, especially before 2020. I wonder what actions were taken to address the Native COVID death rate.

Interestingly enough, these 'cumulative death rates' for COVID-19 being separated both by race and by age seem to link the two in their relationship to COVID. The popular understanding of the virus is that it affects the old and not the young, a biological vulnerability of the elderly's frailty. Given that this is the case in our discussion, does it not also implicitly suggest that any correlation between race and COVID death rates is also biologically related, or otherwise unrelated to policy choices or political oppression? Something to consider.\nOn the subject of race, as usual, there is a false dichotomy (or whatever the term is for 5 groups). An unfortunate consequence of European colonialism is the flawed European understanding of race. No one person can be divided into one 'pure' racial category, despite what they might physically 'present' as. You would be pressed to find someone whose lineage is 'purely' of one racial category -- after all, the human race originated in Africa. Besides this, however, the differences in life expectation and death rates are easy to explain, and relatable to anyone living in poverty. If you are in prison and become infected, you die of COVID. If you are in prison, you are likely to be poor -- this lines up with being 'native', 'Hispanic', or 'black.' The same applies to life expectancy.",

There, you can read about the factors that affect the health of Native Americans.  \n\nI am not sure about whether Covid deaths are \u201cbiologically related.\u201d  You may want to search online for support of this hypothesis.  Also, in these graphs, there is no link shown between race and age.  This analysis could be done, but it is not shown here.  You are correct about the effect of policy choices and its effect on the health of Native Americans.  More reasons are discussed in the article mentioned above.  Finally, statisticians are very particular about the use of the word correlation.  It can only be used when comparing quantitative variables.  For race and Covid death rates - a categorical and a quantitative variable, you can say they are associated.  \n\nHow about a catchy headline that captures the main idea of these graphs?",

I also noticed that in the second visualization there is only color coding for some of the demographics, while others are only a standard grey. I also noticed that the two visualizations have two different sources, one being the CDC and the other being the National Center for Health Statistics. I wonder if the access to health care was a primary factor in some groups having significantly higher deaths per 100,000 people. I also wonder if another graph, a line graph tracking total deaths per group over time could provide greater insight into how communities were affected by Covid. Using such a graph it would be possible to pinpoint when certain groups were hit hard by Covid.",
