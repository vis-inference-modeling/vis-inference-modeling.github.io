    "comment info": "The diminishing water levels in America can be attributed to the dietary preferences of its residents, dominated solely by the diet of meat-eaters. The production of meat, especially beef, requires substantial amounts of water for livestock farming and feeding crops. According to the bar chart, it seems as though the creation of non-vegetarian foods calls for less natural resources to be used as opposed to meat. This allows for less greenhouse gas emissions to splurge into the atmosphere. If Americans wanted to stop great amount of pollution from entering their environment, they should start with the foods they are consuming. Over abounding amounts of these foods may cause a shortage in natural utilities, as shown in the graph, which will be damaging to the environment.",

Is it because chicken takes less time to cultivate and requires less resources, like the groundwater usage in the second graph(therefore also being cheaper)?\n\nIt\u2019s interesting how much chicken and beef have become a staple in the American diet.

As time increased and groundwater levels decreased, diets were comprised of more chicken and cheese. This may be because the cost of water in beef is 2,110 gallons of water per pound. As a result, producers may be drawn towards a more cost-efficient alternative, which would be the production of chicken, costing 410 gallons of water per pound instead. With more more producers, the cost of chicken would decrease, causing more consumers to buy it, and therefore explaining the increasing prominence of chicken in American diets. \n2.) I wonder why beef costs 2,110 gallons of water per pound to produce. Even though chicken and cheese saw a increase in popularity in American diets, beef and pork stayed relatively the same. However, when looking at the cost of water for both products, the cost of water in beef outsized that of the pork\u2019s by a wide margin. \n3.)

    "comment info": "Cluck Over Beef: America's Shift to Poultry Peaks as Water Scarcity Weighs the True Cost of Meat\"\n\nUpon examining the graphs, it's noticeable that Americans have substantially increased their chicken consumption, while beef and pork have declined. This shift coincides with data indicating chicken has a lower water footprint compared to beef and pork. One might wonder if this change is driven by environmental concerns or other factors. This trend relates to broader considerations of sustainable living, suggesting that our community might be moving towards dietary choices that balance nutrition with environmental stewardship.",

Other products like cheese and yogurt have followed this pattern as well, but not as significantly as chicken. Beef and pork consumption has more or less stayed the same. According to figure 2, beef costs the most water to produce, followed by almonds, cheese, pork, chicken, eggs, lentils, beans, and green beans.  I wonder what causes such a steep increase in chicken consumption, but not beef and pork. One possible hypothesis I can think of that relates to my own community is people's cultural dietary restrictions. My family is Hindu so many of them do not eat beef as part of their religion.

While this is happening, beef and pork diets have been relatively constant. A small increase of cheese/yogurt is also present. \n\n2. I am mainly wondering why chicken started to skyrocket in consumption compared to beef/pork. The second graph shows that the cost in water may play a role with beef, as it costs by far the most per pound, of over 2100 gallons required. However, Pork and Chicken are relatively the same, only being a 80 gallon or 17% difference. The reason why pork stayed constant and chicken increased is not able to be concluded with this graph.\n\n3. This relates to me as it takes place in the present day. The data on the graph is still ongoing, and seeing that chicken has the highest consumption also means that chickens out of all of the meats shown (especially cause chickens are smaller than pigs/cows) needs to be bred the most. Its highly probable that there's a point where chicken consumption out weighs this, and the supply will decrease leading to higher prices. \n\n4.

It's likely that the rate at which chicken is being adopted as part of the American diet is greater than the rate at which red meats are being let go from diets, as water usage continues to drop significantly, yet red meats require more water consumption than chicken.

Every single meal has either pork, beef, or chicken as the main source of protein and calories. This needs to change. Not only is meat not healthy for people in the long run, the quality of life of these animals is absolutely terrible. Factory farming is a disgusting way to treat living creatures. We stuff them in tight cages and inject them with hormones and antibiotics that end up in the food we feed our children. And these staple meats aren\u2019t good for the environment either. The demand for cheap, mass produced chicken, beef and pork had pit a strain on our natural environment: It drains groundwater leaving the soil stripped of nutrients, pollutes nearby water sources and spreads disease among animals and humans. The healthier, more sustainable, and more humane alternative is to cut back on the meat. I understand completely eliminating meat from the American diet is impossible, but nobody even tries to look for moderation. There doesn\u2019t need to be one or the other, balance is what we must strive for.",

I thought chicken would require more water as it is commonly eaten by Americans. Lentils, beans, and green peas require less water than the meats which is surprising. Dairy such as cheese and yogurt are not as popular as beef, pork, and chicken. Lastly, popular foods of Americans\u2019 changing diet require a lot of water.\n\nWhy do cheese and yogurt require less water? If most individuals switch to a vegetarian diet, how would this affect the cost in water of popular foods? What foods would become more popular?  If Americans stopped consuming meat, how would this impact the environment?  What can humans eat that does not require a lot of water? If humans continue overconsuming meat, what will happen to the environment in 2060? How much water is needed to produce fish? \n\nThis relates to me as I am a meat-eater and enjoy burgers, steak, and chicken. However, may be best to consume less meat and eat foods that require less water in order to help the planet.  It was interesting to look at food from the perspective of production as I did not know that large amounts of water are used to produce common foods. Water is important, not only for drinking, but also for the production and growing of foods, so it should be conserved as much as possible.\n\nChicken Is Bacon the World Crazy",

The second graph tracks how much water it takes to produce these foods. The first graph shows the popularity of chicken has skyrocketed from under 20 pounds per person in the 1920s to over 80 pounds per person in 2020. It can be concluded this is because farming chickens takes up less water that other meats such as pork and beef as shown in the second graph. In the past few decades, Americans have become more aware of environmental concerns. There is a direct correlation between this new ideology and the increasing popularity of chicken. As Americans aim to conserve water, they are producing more chicken rather than beef and pork because it takes up less water. Cheese is another product that has become popular. I wonder why cheese takes up so much less water to produce than beef if they come from the same animal (cows). I also wondered why yogurt only began gaining popularity in the 1960's. The internet said yogurt only began being sold in America in 1942. In the 1950s, yogurt began gaining popularity because it was ruled a \"health food\". This graph relates to me because these products have extremely high water consumption which has detrimental effects on the environment.

Because of how often Americans consume chicken and cheese specifically, they are using vast amounts of water. This usage of water and the changing diets is putting the health of the earth at risk. Because they are using so much water, the recourse is becoming expensive and risks being overused. I wonder why chicken and cheese are being so highlighted. Beef appears to be a larger issue in water use, so I wonder why it isn\u2019t focused on. This is relevant to me because fast food is very popular in my area.

Something notable is the decrease in the popularity of beef, which could be due to red meat falling out of favor with health professionals for its role in America's heart disease crisis. Despite beef's decline, other cattle products such as cheese and yogurt have been growing in popularity, which is a natural result of the growth of the dairy industry. Overall, the trends in the popularity of beef and chicken indicate that our diet will become more sustainable as time continues. However, the seemingly positive trend must be considered alongside the growing population, which will continue to put more strain on the meat industry and overall increase water expenditure.

Over the last 100 years, chicken has increased the most out of any other foods on this graph.\n\nI wonder why chicken out of all animals to eat is the highest? why do we prefer chicken or eat it most? I also notice how beef and cheese take up a huge percentage of the cost in water. How can this effect our enviroment?\n\nThis relates to my community because my family consumes alot of pork, cheese, chicken, beef, and I wonder how our eating diets is effecting the enviroment, not just my family but everyone else, how is this effecting our health?\n\nWhat meat do you consume the most?",

To Get Onto Americans\u2019 Plates\n\nI notice that while the amount of beef and pork that Americans eat tends to fluctuate over the course of 100 years, the amount of chicken, cheese, and yogurt seems to progressively increase over the years. I notice that Americans\u2019 tendency to eat more chicken in comparison to beef is beneficial to the environment considering that beef requires approximately 5x as much water per pound than chicken. I also notice that almonds require a significant amount of water per pound. I was surprised that almonds use up 560 gallons of water per pound and this data point can also be used to amplify how much water is required in beef as beef still requires 4x as much water as almonds. \n\nI wonder why Americans tend to consume more chicken than beef and pork. Is it due to differences in cost, health reasons, or just preference in taste? I wonder why beef requires such a significant amount of water per pound.

This is good for the environment because beef requires 2,110 gallons of water per pound compared to 410 for chicken.\n\nI wonder why chicken and cheese began increasing in the 1960s. I imagine that the environmental movements of the time precipitated the change, though it is less clear why yogurt gained popularity. I also wonder how Americans' overall health correlates with this graph. Is fast food factored in?\n\nThis affects my community because we are arriving at a water crisis. The description suggests that even the production of feed for chickens is depleting aquifers, so we may need to find a less water-intensive dietary alternative. I try to eat more chicken myself to avoid the water-intense beef.\n\nThis graph depicts the changes in Americans' diets and food items' water consumption. \n\n\"Foodies' Favorites Shift\"",

Over the years we notice chicken increasing the most, and yogurt remaining close to the bottom from start to finish on the first graph. It is interesting that on the other graph, chicken only has 410 gallons per pound, while on the other hand, beef has over 2,000. The other two types of meat on the first graph, beef and pork, are also relatively highly consumed for the entirety of the graph. Consumption of cheese has increased every year on the graph, so I wonder what this graph will look like years from now. Will the continuously increasing lines keep rising or will they begin decreasing? I also wonder if the reason the meats seem to be decreasing in more recent years is that more people might be becoming vegan/vegetarian as that is becoming more popular in society. I also wonder if it has to do with the fact that the gallons of water per pound is significantly more for beef than chicken or pork. This relates to me and my community because I, too, am a consumer of the foods on the graph. My diet and what I consume is part of what the first graph is all about. \n\n\"Don't Chicken Out of a Good Diet!\"",

I notice that Americans have been consuming more chicken than beef these past years. The question posed at the top of the graph is how the foods, chicken, beef, pork, cheese, and yogurt affect the environment which is something I've never thought about but it's intriguing. The second graph below compares American's diet and favorite foods to the amount of water needed to produce a pound of these products. Beef takes up the most water while chicken is the lowest amount of water -- doesn't need as much. I wonder why Americans love their chicken compared to other foods since beef was more popular in past years. Could that be because chicken uses way less water which is more beneficial to the environment? I wonder if the pounds of beef per person, which is 2,100 has decreased because the price of water is high which leads to less production and consumers. This relates to my community because I love chicken and eat it a lot and I have noticed the inflation of food prices in chicken and strawberries or everything at the supermarkets. It's tough out here with the inflation rates as my mom refuses to buy me $9 strawberries LOL. Also, I have seen diet changes through the media such as vegan, paleo, gluten-free, etc. Most people are vegan for ethical reasons to protect the environment. \n\nClean, Green, Lean Diet",

Chicken and cheese have had a steady increase in popularity since 1920, and have continued to climb until the present.\nIn Graph 2, \" The Cost in Water of Some Popular Foods \", it shows how many gallons of water are used to produce one pound of some popular foods. Beef is the most draining of all, consuming 2,110 gallons per pound. Cheese and chicken are more moderate in their consumption, with chicken using 410 gallons per pound and cheese using 520 gallons per pound, respectively.\nI wonder why Graph 2 specifically matters. Doesn't water go back into the environment anyway? Just because water is used in the production of something, that doesn't mean that it just disappears from the water cycle forever. Maybe the water is contaminated? I'm not sure.\nThis relates to me and my community because I eat most of these products and so do the people around me.

I noticed that in 2020, the most eaten food item was chicken, surpassing 80 pounds per person, whereas the least eaten item was yogurt at around 15 pounds per person. I wonder why chicken was the most eaten by Americans in 2020 and what caused there to be such a great spike in pounds per person over the years. Additionally, I noticed that there was a peak in beef intake around 1980, but it started to decrease again in the following years. In the second graph, it depicts the cost in water of certain foods. I noticed that beef had the highest cost of water of 2,110. Connecting to the first graph, I wonder if the pounds of beef per person has seen a trend of decrease since 1980 because it requires so much water and the cost is so high, leading to less production and available beef to consumers. I also wonder if there have been any recent efforts to try to reduce the water amount and cost to produce foods like beef and almonds. This relates to my community because I have noticed food prices constantly fluctuating, with a trend of them mainly increasing, and have witnessed changes in people\u2019s diets based on certain trends in society.

It is, however, disappointing and concerning how this graph lacks any fruits, vegetables, and produce, which are vital to a healthy diet. I was surprised by the amount of water it takes to produce one pound of each product, the number seems so large I cannot imagine how that amount is necessary. These graphs are concerning to me because of the lack of healthy foods being consumed and the excessive amounts of water used to produce them.

Chicken surpasses beef which was the most popular food between 1920 and 1980 after it overtook pork around 1960.\n\nI wonder whether quality, quantity, or simply preference is attributing to the rise in people eating chicken. I also wonder how the data is being collected because certain areas in the US might prefer certain foods over others.\n\nThis relates to me and my community because food prices and preferences are constantly changing which means markets and food outlets must change due to demand from the public.\n\nMore Chicken?",

For example, we have noticed that the amount of chicken that is being eaten has increased exponentially over time. As a group, we were wondering if it is due to chickens being more profitable, more available, tastier, healthier, and/or cheaper. Because the graph has very little information on why American food habits have changed. We were unable to answer these hard-hitting questions. We believe the largest factor for the increase in chicken consumption is the low price of chicken compared to the price of other products on the graph.\n\nIn conclusion, there are a few different variables that could affect the increase in chicken consumption. Because of this, it is hard to be certain from this graph of the possible variables that affect the change in chicken consumption the most.",

I love dairy, I can't pretend I don't use yogurt in everything I cook anymore.\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nI love chicken nuggets. Chicken is the best meat, in my opinion. And I'm glad more restaurants are putting chicken items on their menus. \nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graphs\u2019 main idea.\nChicken invasion? Environmental abrasion!",

In the second graph, beef costs more than triple the amount of water than any other food listed.\n\nWe wonder why certain foods require the amount of water they need, such as beef requiring 2,110 gallons versus almonds needing 500 gallons per pound in 2019. We also wonder what caused products like chicken and cheese to see significant increases in consumption over 100 years while pork and beef decreased largely.\n\nThis relates to our community because I've noticed how much chicken and cheese specifically I have eaten recently.

I will assume it is the annual consumption of each staple in pounds per person. The line is a running average over five years, which smooths it out a bit and makes it easier to see long term trends. Chicken, cheese, and yogurt have gone up a lot but beef and pork have not declined nearly as much, in other words, it looks like people are either many more pounds of these protein-rich staples per year nowadays than earlier. I wonder if there are other staples, not on this graph, that have significant reductions in consumption. If not, this graph implies that the number of calories that people consume has gone up significantly and if that is the case, this graph may show a nice correlation with mean weight, or BMI, of the population over time. If there are other staples that people eat significantly less of, it would be interesting to know what their water needs are. Also, the first graph is per person, which is great, but the population has also increased. So not only has this protein intake increased per person but even more so on an absolute scale because population has increased.

This info should be in the written section, and how the measurement may be changing over the years. I agree with the earlier comment that the amount pound per person also needs per year or month, we both assumed that it would be per year. \nNow I wonder who is being measured. Adults, kids, growing teenage boys?  Did this change over the variation in years. Or is it measuring grocery store sales and average population, which has changed.  \n\nI would have like to see a total protein line on the graph to show how much more animal protein we are eating per person.
