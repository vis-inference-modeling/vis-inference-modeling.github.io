This could make sense since people used to wear masks before to protect themselves from COVID but that is not the case anymore as mask mandates were repealed. \nthe next sharp rise was during 2019-2020 and we see the sharp rise but there is more variability and oscillation of the graph due to mask mandates, isolations, and then relaxation of the mandates and quarantine measures. \nThe general trend indicates that the % of weekly doctors and hospitalization increases every Dec-January. That could be exacerbated due to the winter and cold temperatures and how our immunity has to adapt to the new temperatures and the rise of respiratory illnesses. Interestingly,  the lowest % is in 2020-2021 due to isolation/quarantine and mask mandates as well as the fact that people were vaccinated at the time. \nThis affects my community as we are getting ready to go to work and many people are not wearing masks at work or even at the gym where there is so much closeness.",

This is probably because of quarantine policies and vigilance around COVID. One thing I'm wondering about is just what is causing 2022 and 2023 to have one of the highest peaks for respiratory illness hospital visits, even above 2019 and 2020-- I know there's a resurgence of RSV and it's flu season, but I'm still finding it impressive that they outmatched /the/ COVID era. This is significant to us and our world because it shows us how we're still endangered by respiratory illness, even if talk of COVID is quieting down. A possible title for this is \"Surprise! There's a respiratory illness outbreak worse than 2020's, and it's happening now!\"",

In the years 2020-21 and 2021-22 there was a very significant decrease compared to the pre pandemic average and the peak of the pandemic. This is most likely due to the ability to test yourself, quarantining, and the fear of hospitals itself. \n\n2. I wonder why there was such a significant increase in the percent of weekly doctor and hospital visits in the years 2022-23 even though there has been vaccines and the CDC has issued lower limitations and quarantine times. \n\n3. This relates to me and my community because COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses did affect my town, friends, family, and even myself. Lockdowns and quarantines occurred everywhere and put a stop to many things going on. People couldn't work, could not go to certain places, or couldn't even spend time with the people they love. \n\n4. Can you Describe the Symptoms?",

In 2019-20 from Jan-April these visits would inflex and decrease. Then, mid April there was a decrease til July. In July, they started to increase a bit. As for 2021-22, there was a high peak around January. Finally, for 2020-21, the visits remained sort of consistent, no crazy decreases or increases. One thing all of these have in common, is that near the colder months the visits increase. \n\n- I wonder if the heat or warmer weather affects the number of visits (hence the lower visits). I wonder what factors exactly caused this high number of visits in 2022-2023.\n\n- Influenza, R.S.V. , coronavirus. etc. all affect those around me and their health.

During the pre-pandemic times, visits were around 5.5% from around December to January. For the 2022-2023 year, it increased much more compared to any other time and it began increasing at an earlier time. It went from around 2.5% to roughly 7.5% which is the highest point in the graph.\n2. I wonder if COVID was the main reason as to why it began to increase in 2022-2023. I also wonder why the numbers are lower in 2021-2022 which was when COVID was at its peak worldwide. I also wonder if COVID wasn't the main component of the increase, what other sickness could've caused it? Could the results of people being positive for COVID be the cause of the decrease in 2021-2022 and then cause an increase in 2022-2023?\n3. This relates to my community and me because my father was hospitalized for COVID which caused him to have permanent damage to his lungs and respiratory issues that are being treated. For my community, it affected many people leaving them with treatable or untreatable damage to their respiratory systems. This virus caused a worldwide shut down from how contagious it was. It caused schools to close down and continue instruction virtually for about 2 years, people to work from home, or to be laid off from work, and small businesses to close down.

The dotted line represents the pre pandemic weekly average of doctor/hospital visits for respiratory illness. In 2019-2020, there was a substantial increase in visits, and during the peak of the pandemic, there was a substantial growth\u00a0between January and April. In the years of 2020-2021 and 2021-22, there happens to appear a great decrease in the visits compared to before the pandemic started.\u00a0 This is probably\u00a0due to lockdown and vast self-testing. Folks could have been afraid to visit hospitals in fear that they would also catch any viruses while there. However, during 2022-2023, there is a great increase in the visits.\n2) What I wonder is what initially increased visits in 2021-22, but then began to decline once it reached March-April. And will this year follow in the footsteps of the past 3 years? Where the visit rates increase by a lot but decrease as spring rolls around.  \n3) This relates to me and my community because COVID and other respiratory illnesses have affected myself, friends, and family.

And it\u2019s also the highest overall peak compared to the other lines on any other day. I also noticed that around April of 2020, the percentage of visits went down sharply, which is also around the time when the quarantine began. It\u2019s most likely that because people began to take care of themselves more by wearing masks or staying inside, there was less of a need for any visits.

Another thing I noticed was the sudden increase of visits towards the end of 2022, not even in January yet. \n- I wonder what happens during the end of the year and month of January that causes an increase in visits. Could the sudden increase of 2022 be caused by covid 19. Could it have left long lasting effects causing illnesses on the respiratory system and why is it happening now and not in 2021 or before that. Could these visits just be because of the cold or flu that we tend to get during the winter or is there more to it. \n- This relates to me and my community because covid 19 affected everyone in the world and many family members.

Overall the visits are unsteady but do seem to increase around the same time yearly\n2)What do you wonder?\nDid illnesses like influenza, covid 19, ect. from previous years leave long lasting effects on the respiratory system that influenced the 2022-2023 report. Why was there a surge in doctor visits starting in october for the 2022-2023. What happens in january that makes doctor visits increase by so much almost every year.\n3) How does this relate to you and your community?\nThis report shows cases for respiratory illnesses like influenza and covid 19 that are contagious, if there's a surge in visits as shown in the report it is more likely to spread others including me and my community. We also live right next to new york and there's a lot of people going in and out, new york is highly populated so a virus here could be even more dangerous. \n4) What\u2019s going on in this graph?\nYikes in Spikes!

In the years of 2022 and 2023, however, the percentage f weekly doctor visits for respiratory illnesses is the highest it has been. The percentages for each year reached its highest around the month of January. I also noticed the large decrease in April of 2020, which is probably due to the lockdown. I wonder why in January, the percentages increased the most, and around July it decreases. This relates to me and my community because the recent spike in weekly doctor visits indicates the increase in respiratory illnesses. Covid-19 still appears to be a dangerous illness for some people. \nCatchy Headline:\n\"The Return of Covid-19 To Hospitals\"",

There are a few different lines on the graph to distinguish the year range as well as the time before the pandemic.  One of the trends that stands out is how for the pre-pandemic, 2019-2022, and 2021-2022, the major peak comes around January.  This makes sense because typically, illnesses usually spread the most during the cold, winter months.  Another thing that stands out is in the 2022-2023 graph, it began to spike as early as November.  This hints at the fact that different illnesses may have come a bit earlier this year.  I also notice that during 2020-2021, there was not really a spike.  It seems odd that the peak pandemic years has the lowest percentage.  I wonder what the cause of this is.  I also wonder what the few months after November 2022 for the red line looked like.  Did it continue to rise?

Than the average had decreased exponentially with an all time low throughout 2020-21. Then during the early winter months of 2021-22 the percentage had spiked again, before decreasing gradually. Then the 2022-23 percentage thus far had continued to increase to an all time high. \n\nI wonder why the pre-pandemic average weekly doctor visits was higher than the 2020-21 average. I also wonder why the 2022-23 weekly doctor visit was higher than all of the previous COVID years. \n\nI observe that the peak of the 2019-20 peak percentages correspond to the beginnings of the Coronavirus pandemic. Thus the weekly doctors visits may have been higher before the nationwide quarantine was put into place early March. This was likely why the doctors visits continued to be low throughout 2020-21. Then in the early winter of 2021-22, the respiratory illnesses spiked again, corresponding with another rise in Covid. The early winter was also shown to be the time that the average pre-pandemic respiratory illnesses spiked. The 2022-23 respiratory illnesses has been the highest than it has ever been earlier than average. This could be because people's respiratory systems had been weakened from the pandemic, resulting in being more susceptible to respiratory illnesses.\n\nIn my own community I have seen a rise in colds earlier than normal, for the winter season.\n\nHeadline: \"Covid: The Residual Effects\"",

For example, prepandemic visits were approximately 5.5% from late December to January; for the same period in 2019-20, visits were approximately 6.5% just as coronavirus was beginning; 2020-21 visits were approximately 1.5%, likely due to quarantine and then masking, with little virus circulating; and 2021-22 visits were just under 5%. in accordance with pre pandemic levels. 2022-23 is remarkable, with incidences increasing substantially earlier, from October to December - from roughly 2.5% to over 7.5%, the highest point of any year on the graph. \n2. I'm curious if the repeal of the mask mandate is one of the reasons contributing to the dramatic spike in medical visits.

Back to masking?\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nCOVID has impacted our school's community because of the cancellation of events and distance learning. Additionally, it has improved the use of safety protocols. In Vallejo, there are two hospitals where patients can receive medical attention. There are undoubtedly individuals who leave owing to respiratory conditions.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?\nRespiratory Illnesses Peak Early and Reach Record Levels: Don't Breathe Easy Yet",

    "comment info": "1.  Prior to 2022-23, the peak for doctor and hospital visits for respiratory illnesses generally occurred in winter months.  For example, during late Dec through Jan., prepandemic visits were approximately 5.5%; for the same period 2019-20 visits were approximately 6.5% (right as coronavirus was starting); 2020-21 visits were approx 1.5% (this was likely so low because of quarantine and then masking, not much virus circulating); and 2021-22 visits were just under 5% (in line with prepandemic levels).  2022-23 seems unusual with cases trending steeply upward early, from Oct-Dec -- from approx 2.5% to approx 7.5%, highest point of any year on graph.\n2.  I wonder why cases in 2022-23 rose so high -- higher than ever before -- so quickly and so much earlier than in prior years.  I also wonder what steps can be taken to help stop the increase (more vaccines?  A return to masking?).\n3.  My family and I have all gotten our flu and covid shots soI feel pretty confident that if we do get sick we will be ok.  But I worry that if there are that many sick people these illnesses will spread more easily and people like my grandmother -- who has lung cancer and other underlying health conditions -- will be at greater risk of getting seriously sick.  I also wonder whether our school district will begin making us wear masks again if rates of respiratory illness are very high in our community.  \n 4. \"Don\u2019t Breathe Easy Yet:  Respiratory Illnesses Peak Early, Reach Record Levels\"",

You can tell that increase in the cases of respiratory illness happens in waves because the percentage of weekly doctor and hospital visits fluctuates. 2019-2020 and 2022-23 have higher percentages of visits than 2020-21 and 2021-22.

Due to the fact that it was current data at the time, that data is also the only one that stops around November instead of spanning across the graph. Typically, the highest percents tend to be between January and April, reaching lower numbers after April. I also noticed that between 2020 and 2021, the graph was the most consistent with only minor increases or decreases, while the others tended to have drastically high spikes in the percentages. Something that sticks out to me about the dates is that they span across the years of Covid-19. \n2) What do you wonder?\nLifting the mask mandate inevitably caused hospital visit numbers to rise, but I wonder if there were any other factors that caused such a large spike in recent years?\n3) How does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to my community because more hospital/doctor visits mean more people feeling ill/testing positive for various illnesses, so it is our job to keep protecting ourselves and those around us.\n4) What\u2019s going on in this graph?\nThis graph shows the percent of weekly doctor/hospital visits for respiratory illnesses in the U.S. My headline would be: New Year Means New Highs in Hospital Visits.",

The graph line for 2019-20 was most surprising because there are three peaks of illness that are ~1-2 months from each other and reach a close percentage of doctor visits for that year. Yet, just a month later, the percent in which people are going to the doctor due to illness drops a great sum during 2019-20.

I also noticed the immediate spike in doctors visits during the pandemic. One more detail I noticed about the graph is that people usually suffer from respiratory illness in the winter and spring and numbers of hospital visits decrease in the summer and fall. \n\nFirst, I wonder why this year\u2019s numbers of respiratory illnesses are so high already. Compared to earlier years it seems like hospital visits have drastically increased. Second, I wonder why numbers in hospital visits took a hit in 2020-21. The data line is significantly below the other years despite COVID still growing. Then, I wonder what the dips are for in the year 2019-2020. \n\nThis relates to my community because COVID and the flu has affected multiple people in my life. I have also been affected by both COVID and the flu and this graph gives an insight to the dangers of these respiratory illnesses. It is important to keep your community informed so that numbers for 2022-23 can decrease. \n\nIn this graph, the number of hospital visits due to respiratory illness throughout the years are visualized through lines. A catchy headline to this graph is, How the respiratory system has wavered throughout the years.",

    "comment info": "What I notice is that 2020-21 was pretty calm, there weren't big fluctuations which means there were not as many people visiting the hospital/doctors because of respiratory illness. At the start of the pandemic it impacted a lot of people and that led to more people visiting the doctor. I noticed it almost reaches the pandemic average in 2021-22, but then there\u2019s a huge drop. In 2022-23 I can see the rise and how many people have actually started to visit the hospital, it\u2019s almost matching the beginning of the pandemic in 2019 when it was bad. \nWhat I wonder is why are there so many people in 2022-23 going to the hospital for respiratory illnesses, is it a new strain of COVID or a new disease. In 2019-20 there\u2019s a huge increase. My question is were people just going to hospital because they were scared and worried that any respiratory illness was COVID or were there actual cases? Maybe the amount of cases dropped through the years because people self tested or didn\u2019t want the stigma of having COVID. \nThis relates to me and my community because they were impacted by respiratory illnesses which include COVID and the other strains of it. However, some people in my community visited the doctor or hospital because they would get worried of having COVID but in reality they didn\u2019t. Also my belief was that it was worse than shown on the graph of the year 2020-21, since it was still fairly new and rising between people. \nCatchy Headline: Respiratory Illness on the Rise this New Year",

Is the percentage of deaths of people that visit the hospital higher or lower this year compared to others? Is the spike in cases in January related to the cold weather or other holiday factors? Did this holiday season bring more people together than others and is that why there is such a large spike currently.",

It seems that visits to the doctor/hospital dropped drastically in 2020 and 2021, which doesn't make sense to me because the pandemic had just recently started to appear and it is a respiratory illness. \nMaybe because some media and politics were saying it was a hoax or because people did not yet know how fatal it could be or did not want to acknowledge it as they did in previous years?",

One is that people who did get COVID or other respiratory illnesses did not want to spread it further so they would just quarantine. Also since people were locked down in their houses, people were getting sick less often.",
