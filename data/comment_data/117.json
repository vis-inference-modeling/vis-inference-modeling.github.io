I've noticed the 2-3 graph demonstrates some blue voter areas shaded in red and vice versa, which may increase fairness in political power. Also, all three graphs illustrate more blue than red grid pieces. I wonder if district voting lines created with bias affect election results, since some have speculated unfairness in the polls. The district voting lines relate to my community because New York is known to have a somewhat close amount of red and blue supporters.

The first example shows the Blue Party taking the vote in all five districts. This example shows how a district can be divided in a biased way in the extreme in favor of the Blue Party. The second example is the more reasonable way to split up voters or districts than the two others. However, each side is put into its own sections and is unrealistic. The third example shows how the Red party can win without a majority in the state. It's interesting to see all the ways districts can be divided and how many ways it can be skewed to one side.

From that i conclude that whichever color they are highlighted is the party which majority of the votes will go to.

Say there is a state that is 60% blue party and 40% red party, yet the state is a 'red state' based on election results. Who divides districts?

This graph demonstrates how the arrangements of lines can impact the outcome of a vote. The lines could be made to benefit one party. Boundary lines can be manipulated to benefit one political party. This can make elections unfair and biased. For example in the bottom left graph, the boundary lines are arranged so that blue is shown to be the dominant party in the whole area. The votes of the red party are ignored and unseen. I wonder how the arrangement of lines is chosen? Do state governments or the national government choose where the lines are placed?

I also noticed that in the third example, it appears that the red party is in favor for the district even though the blue party makes up 60% of the voters.\n\nI wonder how the voting districts truly impact the outcome of the election if either way 60% will vote blue and 40% will vote red.\n\nThis relates to me and my community because all of the elections that happen around me, locally, impact me in one way or another. The presidential election has even more of an impact on me. On top of that, I will be voting next year, so it is important for me to be able to form my own opinions and understand how voting districts work. \n\nThe District Debate of Voting: Is it Fair?",

I notice that there are 3 possible ways to draw the boundaries for each district but I am not sure which one is the fairest. I would immediately eliminate 2 because that clearly is drawn to favor each party which seems very biased. However, between 1 and 3 I am not sure which is the least biased. Additionally, I wonder how much gerrymandering has affected the last couple of local elections and which states partake in it the most.",

However, despite their being a larger number of \"blue\" voters, the \"red\" voters are able to be redistricted in a manner that benefits them and disadvantages the more heavily supported \"blue\" party.\n2. I wonder when the United States will nationally standardize a specific system to redistrict appropriately. For example, some states hire nonpartisan organizations to redistrict their respective populations. However, many states continue to unfairly redistrict the populace.\n3. This graph relates to my community and I because redistricting plays a vital role in the state. New York's voters are predominantly part of the Democratic Party; however, if the state were gerrymandered in favor of the Republican Party, it is possible that the state would vote in more republicans in legislative positions.\n4. The graph depicts three examples of a single district being gerrymandered. It illustrates an equal way, with the majority having control, and two unequal methods, in which one party monopolizes control over the other. Overall, the graph demonstrates a major issue present in the United States' government. A catchy headline could be \"The Flaw That Can Change Elections: Gerrymandering\"",

By this logic, would the other two be just as manipulative?\n\nThis relates to my community because the American voting system seems skewed, and muffles the voice of the people who vote.

Manipulating the boundaries of an electoral constituency to favor one party is a practice that has been done since the early 19th century. In this graph, I notice who has the majority (blue) and who is in the minority (red). In an ideal and fair election, the goal would be to have both parties represented in each district. I would interpret the first of the three examples as unfair and unequal, because the blue party is the majority in all 5 districts. The second and third graphs, although not equal, are more fair. Within the five districts, they have both parties represented as a majority which is important. This is important because it allows for a more balanced representation of constituents. In a more personal context, this is important because if I were to vote for red party in the all blue party dominated districts, my vote would get lost and lose its value, as well as my faith in a fair voting system",

I wonder how often and to what extent states redraw these voting district lines unfairly, as well as if it is even possible to eradicate the process of gerrymandering completely. The drawing of voting lines directly affects me and my community as it can make all the difference in who wins an election and therefore represents us as a whole population. If voting district lines are drawn unfairly, giving the minority an advantage, then a majority of people will be unhappy with who ends up elected. The graph specifically shows a sample of voters with, as said previously, a 60% majority of blue and 40% of red, then displays the same sample drawn with boundaries that give the blue a 5:0 advantage, then another with a 3:2 blue advantage, and finally one with the lines drawn to give the red party a 3:2 advantage despite having fewer voters in the sample. A possible headline for the graph could be: \"Electoral College: Making Us Voiceless\".",

I also wonder how they would eventually group these voters into voting districts. The way this relates to me and and my community is that these voters are part of the percentage who vote over who governs the United States and how things are handled. What is going on in this graph is that a group of 25 voters from a state that live in a perfect grid are being grouped into five voting districts with each voting district having five voters.

I also noticed that there are 25 voters and 60% are blue and 40% are red. Another noticing I found while looking at this graph was that this is a visual representation to show how the census works. My last noticing is that they used blue and red to represent democrats and republicans.\n\nI am wondering if this is accurate, The census isnt very accurate in my opinion so I am wondering how accurate this is. I am also wondering who are the voters like what group do they fit into ? for example are they mostly white males in their 30's or are they Hispanic women in their 40's?\n\nThis impacts my community because the census just happened last year and most families didn't fill it out \n\nmy catchy headline for this graph would be: which party are you in? red vs blue... who will win ???",

What i wonder is how there would be any way to actually distribute them equally. Not really sure how it would relate to our community because I don't interact with the political climate in it. However, in essence gerrymandering isn't good for anyone, so if it were to take place, then that would be a really big cause of concern. Since this graph is showing these different possible voter distributions, it should be called \"New possible distributions of votes in Herio County leaked!!!
