It makes me wonder why this is the case. For 2021 it would make sense to see little growth because of covid but for the previous years, it must have been something else. If I had to guess I would assume America has too many people and not as many people can come to migrate to the U.S. anymore.

What makes it more interesting is that it remained similar despite the drastic slow in population growth exhibited by the rest of the country from 2017-2021. I notice that the worst of the slowing of population growth in that period can be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the drop in annual population change had already begun in 2016. I wonder what the central cause for this was; was it because of fewer immigrants from other countries? New laws? Or was it something entirely different? I also noticed that in 2015, the U.S. experienced the most population change out of the entire decade--what could have caused this? Another thing that I wonder is what the driving factor for the top ten counties' annual population change to remain steady throughout the decade was. Even in the pandemic from 2020-2021, how did the counties\u2019 population change remain unaffected and even grow from previous years?",

After 2016 however, the population had started decreasing hitting a low at 2018 - 2019. Around the time Covid 19 started. The rest of the U.S population, had stayed around the same until 2017 when numbers started immensely dropping. I wonder why the population of the top ten counties, and the population of the rest of the U.S started dropping at around the same time? Was it because of Covid? Because the population was, and is so large in the top ten counties, more people probably died from Covid. More people also probably moved to other, safer, places that were more secluded from covid.     I myself lived in the U.S and had many friends move away because the disease got so bad. I also had many older friends that lived in smaller cities that passed because of Covid. That's also probably the reason the Rest of the U.S population decreased around the same time the Population of the top ten counties decreased.",

I wonder what was going on during those three years that made people want to move to America. There are so many different factors that could play a role. A piece of data that would be helpful in answering this question is who was coming into the U.S. at the time. Could it have been the American Economy was very strong at the time? It may have been that in other places such as Europe things weren't going so well. I know that the Brexit deal started in 2016. That also could've played a role.  Overall a very good point to think about.",

Population density in 2021 had the top ten counties being more populated than the rest of the country.  I could only wonder why this is. Is this due to increase economic growth in the cities or highly populated metro areas? I wonder why this is because as a result of COVID, a lot of people gravitated away from the cities as lock downs made large county and presumably city life very challenging. I wonder what the data would look life for 2022? Will the population in major counties continue to grow, or will the increase in population abate as people move outside of major counties?

Both cities are incredibly diverse, and hubs for all types of cultures. There is certainly a growing job market because of this, so maybe that is something to consider. Even though both cities have relatively high costs of living, there are always people moving in. Both are very popular cities for immigrants from other countries to settle down in. In conclusion, because of each city\u2019s respective desirability, even if people are leaving it, there are always a high flow of immigrants coming in whether domestic or from other countries, so that may be why for many of the top ten counties their annual population change remains relatively consistent.

This relates to our community because during this period, there was a decrease in population, maybe due to the pandemic travel restrictions and lack of immigrants during the 5 years of decline. \nA good headline would be, 'A Lack of Immigration.'",

However, I do realize that it may take a good amount of time to rebound. I wonder if the numbers of annual population change will return to at least pre-Covid numbers in a year or two.  If not soon, would it ever? Could previous annual population change data be surpassed? I also think it would be interesting to see what the data for the year 2022 would look like, do you think there would be an increase or decrease from the previous year?",

But in these two years, the top ten counties stay consistent throughout the whole graph. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder how COVID affected 2020 and 2021.

Between the years of 2011 and 2016, the population changes were fairly consistent; the U.S averaged an average increase of a little over 2 million people, while all other countries represented in this graph had an increase of approximately 500,000 people. What was the reasoning behind these differences? However, beginning in 2017, and in all the following years, there were drastic drops in population growth within America. \n\nWhat caused this rapid decline? Perhaps it was because of political, environmental, or socioeconomic concerns? In 2021, there was the biggest drop of the decade. Was this fueled by the increasing mortality rates from Covid-19, as well as the fears of another pandemic? Did prospective families fear what could happen in the future?\n\nAs an American, I wonder how these population changes will affect the economy.

I noticed that the top 10 counties population is what seems to cause a lot of the change in the rest of the U.S, as that number increases or decreases, the rest of U.S population seems to mostly follow in the same direction. I also noticed the drastic drop in population overall, going from the 2,000,000s to below 500,000.\n2. I wonder why there were not such large differences in the years 2011-2014 as there were in 2017-2020. I also wonder if the large drop between 2020 and 2021 was due to covid.\n3.  Despite the fact that I do not live in one of the top 10 counties, this can affect me and my community because if the 2020-2021 drop was covid related, many people in my area were affected by it and the population around me also dropped.\n4.

Its population, measured by the dark blue bar, is not exceeding a population of 500,000. However, in the rest of America, represented by the light blue bar, the population is fluctuating a lot.

The most prevalent thing that I noticed was the significant difference in population fluctuation between the top ten counties and the rest of the country. However, starting from 2016 the population change in the rest of the country begins to change greatly, dropping about 500,000 a year. The county populations also decrease slightly from their previous average. \n\nI wonder what would have caused the rapid decrease in the population change in the years following  2016. The graph mentions that this is the annual population change, which leads me to wonder whether this is a population increase or decrease. I also wonder why the population changes in the counties remained mostly consistent, while the rest of the United States changed greatly. For example, when the population change in the rest of the US only changes by about 100,000, the population change for the counties is nearly consistent. \n\nFrom this graph I also observe that the population change was exceptionally low for the rest of the United States. I believe that this may be due to the Coronavirus. In the year 2021, due the contagious nature of the pandemic, many people were not able to leave their homes, accounting for the exceptional small change in population. \n\nHeadline: \"Where Did Everyone Go?\"",

In 2011, the country's population was well over 200 million Americans and then in 2017 it started to drastically decrease. However, the ten largest counties' population did change throughout the years, but not as much as the rest of the country. The ten counties' population stayed under 500,000 all those years and the rest of the U.S went from over 200 million to less than 500,000, but a little more than the ten counties.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\n- I wonder what caused this drastic change in population. I wonder what keeps the top ten counties' population under 500,000. I wonder if this big drop is a good thing or if it's something we should be worried about. \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\n- This relates to me and my community because we live in the United States, which makes us a part of the graph.

You also wondered what would have caused the change in population of the top ten counties to remain under 500,000. Since the population in the top ten counties is significantly smaller than that of the entire country, their populations would change on a different scale. Therefore making a 500,000 population change for a county significant.\n\nYou also mention the drastic decrease in the change of population starting in 2017, why do you think that this population change occurred?",

Before, other areas had rather consistent population growth per year, but after 2017, it took a steep dive and is now extremely low. This is probably due to rural-urban migration and people not having children, resulting in less people in smaller towns and more people in larger cities. One question that is possible is why the change in the top counties has stayed the same the same and/or decreased even though the other sections have decreased in population growth. Overall, this drop in population could, and probably will, result in more and more empty job positions, and an decrease in the economy's performance as less people are able to work and more people need to be taken care of.

The annual population changes for the top ten counties stay relatively similar (just under 500,000) while the annual population change for the rest of the U.S. had a steady decline over time. \n2. One thing that I wonder is what caused this steady decline of the rest of the U.S and why the top ten counties weren't impacted. \n3. This applies to me and my community because it shows how population distribution has changed over the years and how it is impacting our modern-day America.

Throughout the decade, the ten largest countries do not surpass 500,000 people. In 2011, the US was at about 2, 400,000 people, decreasing in 2013 to about 2,200,000, surpassing 2011\u2019s population with about 2,600,00, and by 2021 the population is at least 400,000 people. There is no consistency in the population of the US like there is for the top ten countries. \n2. What do you wonder? I wonder if the reason for the drastic decrease in the USA's population is due to the pandemic. Almost a decade ago the number was over 2,000,000 people and now it is less than 500,000 people. The pandemic began in 2019 which is aligned when significant change is seen.  \n3. How does this relate to you and your community? This relates to me and my community because I am a resident of the US. At some point there was a concern for overpopulation but it does not seem to be a major issue as of right now.

The cause of this change was due to natural causes(birth and death) and immigration. By viewing the top ten countries population they've kept an accurate rate and have not passed 500k. But as for the rest of the U.S. they began to drop dramatically after the year 2016. But what benefits both sides would be their count during the year 2015, being their highest throughout the decade.\n\n2. This chart has left me with a few questions. Was it because of COVID-19 that the numbers of the American population dropped drastically? And were the top 10 countries not affected as much as the U.S. when it came to natural causes and immigration?\n\n3. This relates to me and my community because as COVID-19 made its way towards us many lives were taken away and the death rate along with those who were still alive while being tested positive were rising at an unpredictable rate. First week we had a hundred cases and the next over a thousand. Looking at the population of the rest of the U.S. from 2017-2021 it could've most likely been to deadly diseases. \n\n4.

I wonder why those two years had a major decrease in change versus the other years although I am almost completely sure that it is due to Covid 19\n3. I am not 100% sure how this graph would relate to my community specifically, but I think it relates to me because when Covid hit, no one was moving or relocating very much because of the fear that everyone felt\n4. This graph is showing the changes of population over the years. I think it should be called \"Population Overload\"",

I also noticed that despite the large decrease in change of \"the rest of the U.S\" the \"top ten countries\" stays pretty much consistent. i wonder what happened in 2017 to start this decrease and what kind of change is being documented.",

I wonder why the population of the US as a whole experienced such a signifcant loss in growth in the past five years.  \nThis relates tp my community as I live in a county so I can use personal collected data and compare it to the data provided. The graph displays the growth of popualtions in the US as a whole vs. in individual counties since 2011-2021. A catchy headline could be \"County vs. Country Counting\".",

A headline I would choose would say \"Population change in the US on a rapid decline\"",

Please share with us know what you discover.  \n\nOrange County is the sixth largest county in the U.S.  What has been happening there since the beginning of the pandemic?",
