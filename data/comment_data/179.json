Some slices look very similar in size, which makes the differences hard to judge. A bar chart would have made the comparisons clearer. Still, the colours and layout make the chart easy to understand at a glance. The movie revenue chart looks cool because of the posters, but the design actually makes it harder to read the data. The images distract from the bar lengths, so it\u2019s not easy to compare revenues across years. If I were to recreate it in Excel, I\u2019d use a standard bar chart. I do like that the timeline is clear, but overall the chart focuses more on style than clarity.",

They may feel frustrated or worried about these problems and may not necessarily believe that adults are doing a good job of addressing them or running the world. They might perceive adults as not taking sufficient action or prioritizing short-term gains over long-term sustainability and well-being.\n\n2. I wonder what fourth graders might think about various global challenges, such as environmental degradation, economic inequality, social injustice, and conflicts. They may question whether adults are effectively addressing these issues and making decisions in the best interest of future generations. They might also wonder about the role they can play in contributing to positive change and whether their voices will be heard and valued in discussions about the world's problems.\n\n3.

However, the sample consists primarily of children from urban areas, which raises the possibility of bias. Taking a more diverse sample of 14-year-olds from various geographic locations may alter these findings and produce more accurate results.

I'm also curious how recent this survey was, as global warming and the ongoing\u00a0current conflict between Israel and\u00a0Hamas and\u00a0Russia, and Ukraine\u00a0could have influenced the results if it had been conducted more recently.

The first graph asks what the major problems are with the answers including homelessness, war, money, climate change, and other. The second graph then elaborates on public sentiment on whether or no the older generations in power are handling these issues well. It can be inferred that the younger generations were the groups surveyed. Homelessness and the housing criss are prominent issues on the minds of Millennials and Gen Z. Similarly, climate change and current international issues are important to many young people and are prominent issues on social media. This inference is then furthered by the majority vote that Adults are not running the world well. It is unlikely for older people to vote against themselves, so it is fair to assume that the poll was held among younger people. This relates to me because I am a member of the younger generations. The results and my relationship to the graph make me wonder how my generation will run the country when it is our time.

In the other pie chart, 30% agree that adults are doing a good job of running the world, and 40% disagree. The other remaining 30% claim they don\u2019t know for sure.\n\nI wonder why money is rated so lowly as a large problem, when it has ties to almost every other problem on the pie chart. I think it could be because it\u2019s obvious that money is a problem, but people need to find a subject or problem caused by monetary issues that they could put a real name to. In this case, homelessness was chosen.\n\nThis shows me and others how large of a problem homelessness really is, and how many people disagree that the world is being run correctly. This is a reminder that the world, even though made more comfortable due to industrialization for many, still has massive imperfections and flaws that need to be addressed, such as homelessness and war.\n\nHeadline:\nCharting our Global Discord: Varied Perceptions on World Issues and Adult Leadership",

I notice that almost the majority of kids say homelessness and do not believe that adults are doing a good job running the world. I wonder if the location the child lives in affects their answer to these questions. I also wonder how much a 9-year-old really knows about climate change, homelessness, and war. The results of this poll relate to me and my community because as I turn 18 in the coming months I have to pay attention more to what is going on in this world how I am going to vote and if the people I am voting for reflect my ideas on what the world/country needs to work on.

There are a lot of problems that need to be solved, and people are aware of them. However, not many people agree with the way that our government is being run and the people who are in control of it. People clearly have strong opinions and awareness regarding issues in the world that need to be solved. A lot of these issues are humanitarian, people are more worried about homelessness and war than economic issues like money. I think this shows how people feel, but it is not at all reflected in the actions of our society and government. I think this leads into the next graph and explains why people mostly do not agree with the state of the leaders and government of our country. Only 30% of people actually agree with the way things are, a number that is shockingly and worryingly low. I would title this graph: \u201cHow Successful is Our Society?\u201d",

Still, there are only a few of them, compared to other things said, that think that money is the biggest problem, which surprises me how fourth graders know about war but don't know the struggles of money. I also noticed that more than half of them are unsure or don't think adults are doing a good job in the world. \n2. I wonder how the views of these children will change in a few years, I wonder if they would think the same or if they would have other things to say that are problems other than money or homelessness. I also wonder how many of their opinions on whether or not adults are doing a good job will change if they get asked again at the start of high school and the end of it if it would be more accurate to actual problems.\n3. I can't entirely agree with half the results shown in the graph for the biggest problems that need to be solved, I do think that war is a major problem but I think Climate change should have bigger a percentage than 6 and I think other students would agree, Homelessness is definitely a big problem in LA but I don't think it's a major problem in the world like climate change or money. I agree with the graph about whether or not adults are doing a good job, I don't know if adults are, but I don't think they are doing the best they could be doing.\n4. \"What do fourth graders think adults suck at solving.\"",

I was more intrigued by the left graph as it shows how fourth graders feel about adults which is a point of view that is not well represented because of kids' lack of maturity. But I have a pessimistic view on both graphs because I believe that humans working together to solve problems like these is not something that would happen regularly or in a way that would permanently solve the problem. The reason is that the companies who have the power to change these things won't because there is a lack of incentive to. Humanitarian organizations like UNICEF will always have bad people or money-hungry companies do something to stop them from liberating sweatshops or stopping child labor. People who want to change the world in a good way will always be fighting people who want to watch the world burn and everything along with it.",

Those two topics can be put in the same category and have a lot in common as one of the problems in the world is the bad influence that many adults give off, which affects children. It can be this way for adults because of their childhood when older generations reflected negative habits on them. This caused the adults to get used to them and practice them because the adults in their background when they were young made it seem okay for bad acts to be committed. This rubs off on the youth as we see more cases of them beginning to do the same wrong things. For this reason, grown-ups must do a better job preaching good acts in kids' lives so bad habits won't get in the way of their future.",

I personally think we can really do something to lower the chart especially in the homelessness section, people should be mindful and should put themselves in peoples shoes and realize not all homeless choose that path, and unfortunately some do. but either way we as people should help others because at the end of the day we are all human and we need  each other in some way.

What I wonder is how the idea was brought up to conduct this survey and see how the younger generations see the world from a different perspective. Also if the results would be different if they interviewed kids from the suburbs rather than big cities because there is a major bias presented. What's going on in this graph is it is trying to display what 4th graders most likely want to see changed by the time they are adults. Additionally, what problems these 4th graders from big cities see most presented in their daily lives. This relates to my community because even though high schoolers are years older than 4th graders, I believe there are still points in time where we feel our voices aren't heard.

I noticed that the first pie chart's answers are related to current events. The most common issue that these fourth graders chose is homelessness. Currently, a lot of big states are being affected by homelessness. Some examples include  California(Skid Row, the Mole people, etc), New York, and many more states. The second most popular choice is war. As one may know, Russia is invading Ukraine. Though most of the attention has died down, it's still a big impact. The second chart asks about whether adults are doing a good job at running the world. Most fourth graders disagreed which I also agree with.\n\nOne thing I wonder about is whether these views are from a biased view of a fourth grader. These fourth graders might not fully view the world's current events, which might skew the results.\n\nI feel that our class would have a drastically different answer. I feel that homelessness and war would be pushed down the list while other options would be pushed up. There would also be more of a consensus on whether the current adults are doing a good job at running the world.\n\nOne headline that fits this article is: \"Fourth Graders - Can They Run A Country?\"",

Another important factor to take into account is that some of the children interviewed may have just picked a random response or the first one on the list. All of the reasons being written out for the \"Other\" option make me believe that the fourth graders were problem given a list of choices. Otherwise, it isn't hard to believe that there would be at least a few kids who put down stuff such as \"I didn't get the game I wanted\" or another unserious response. I will only touch briefly on the other graph, but I think one reason that many of the students voted that adults were not doing a good job was because they don't understand their struggles. Not to say that there's nothing big corporations or governments could be doing to solve problems such as homelessness because there are. I believe they just may not believe how hard it is to get things to change. When I was little I wanted to be president, and I genuinely thought I could accomplish that. I didn't realize how hard it is to just stay off of the streets as an adult. (part 2)",

An example of this is homelessness being voted as the biggest problem that needs to be fixed. While it's not necessarily wrong, other large problems, such as world hunger, were voted what would seem disproportionately low. I think the reason that homelessness was voted so high was because of what the fourth graders experience in their everyday lives. The cities that the students that were interviewed come from, San Diego, Providence, and Spokane, are all cities with very high rates of homelessness. While it may be somewhat easy for a family to hide money problems or violence on the news from a kid, it's hard to hide homelessness. You can't just throw an invisibility cloak over people sleeping on stoops when you walk down the street. It is often hard for fourth graders to imagine other people's problems who live very different lives, so it may be hard for them to imagine war or the extreme hunger and lack of resources some people have to live with.

With so many other important issues on the world\u2019s canvas, it\u2019s interesting that nearly half decided on this. Similarly, 30% said war, rather than issues that could cause the entire world to face problems- such as climate change and world hunger. I definitely don\u2019t oppose the two issues that the kids are so drawn to, but it\u2019s definitely not what many adults and even teens would say. In the current world situation, I know that many Gen-Zers strongly oppose climate change, which I believe would hold the largest portion of the chart if they were the subjects.\n        Additionally, I notice that a great portion of the students think adults are doing a poor job of running the world. It\u2019s interesting that such young people have seemingly already opposed leaders of the world. That brings me to ask the question- Have adults taught them this? At the age they\u2019re at, not many have access to news websites or social media, so all their knowledge of world leaders presumably comes from others. It\u2019s quite strange!\n\tIf it was up to me and my classmates, we\u2019d surely have similar opinions about world leaders, but that comes from our knowledge of the world.

War can also seem much more frightening to kids because most of the time they don\u2019t understand it and older people have seen it much more, making it seem very normal for these bloody battles to happen.

I think these are expected responses, especially because I know I would've answered similarly when I was a 4th grader. What I thought was more interesting was the second graph. Young kids, especially at the age of a 4th grader, tend to be very honest. Seeing kids' feelings on such a broad question is important because they aren't trying to cover anything up.\n         As a 7th grader, if kids in my class were asked these questions, I think the answers would be similar.

I find it interesting that the children voted climate change and war as larger issues in the world, because these problems could impact their generation the most as they grow up and become adults. The fourth graders also disagreed with the sentiment that adults are doing a good job of running the world. This makes me think that the children polled are fairly knowledgeable about world problems. I would have assumed that children would list bullying as a big world problem because that is something that is more likely to be addressed at that age. I also would have thought more children would think that adults were doing a good job in running the world by looking up to and relying on their own parents. I wonder how often fourth graders discuss the world problems listed in the pie chart in school or at home? How are they educated about these problems? I agree mostly with the children\u2019s response to the biggest problems in the world that need to be solved. Personally, I would have listed homelessness, world hunger, war and climate change as large problems. My classmates probably would disagree with adults doing a good job running the world due to problems with climate change and war. \n\n\u201cShould 4th-Graders Run the World?\u201d",

On the other graph, I am surprised that the highest percentage of children do not trust adults to run our world. \n\n\nI wonder if the prevalent issue and the common sight of displaced people in the US cause children to lean towards that as our biggest issue. This would make sense because the many mental images of urban areas in the US would include not only skyiiscrapers and large malls but also the population of the homeless and their temporary tents everywhere around these urban areas. In contrast, other issues like wars, climate change, and world hunger, which are objectively bigger problems for governments and nations of the world, will not appear in the minds of 4th graders and will be represented less in the graph. \n\n\nI don't agree with 4th graders who believe adults are not doing a good job at running the world.

It is in pie chart format with two pie charts next to each other. Some of the biggest world problems mentioned include homelessness, climate change, war, and money.

I would assume that 4th graders think homelessness is such a significant issue because it's a problem they see often rather then rights issues for example. \n\n3.

I wonder what money refers to, whether this relates to inflation, interest rates, or even the national debt. I wonder if this percentage is low because many children do not comprehend many different aspects of finances and do not consider money as being an area of concern. I agree that homelessness is an incredibly significant issue in the world. However, I think that money, if it refers to interest rates and inflation, is a much larger issue than it is depicted in the graph.

The pie chart on the left shows that 42% of the fourth graders surveyed think that homelessness is the biggest problem today. The largest percentage of fourth graders most likely think this is the most pressing issue because it is so common and they might see it very often depending on where they live. Additionally, 31% of the fourth graders surveyed think that war is the biggest problem today. Even as fourth graders, they probably are aware of the wars going on across the world and U.S. involvement. They might not understand the complexity of the wars or why they started, but they know that war is a very scary thing and that everyone should get along. I am surprised that 40% of fourth graders disagree that adults are doing a good job running the world. I feel like it is probably their environment at home. If parents are complaining constantly about the government, inflation, war, etc. the children will be more prone to thinking that adults are not doing a good job running the world. \n*continued",

I wonder if this is because homelessness is an issue that gets a decent amount of news coverage and one that many children may have experienced either in their hometowns or when traveling as it is so profound globally. I know that as a fourth grader, homelessness was definitely one of the issues that I had heard most about and one that I experienced living so close to N.Y.C. I also notice that 40% of fourth graders disagree with the statement that adults are doing a good job of running the world. This means that the majority of fourth graders believe adults are doing a good job of running the world. I wonder if this is because children are more likely to trust the adults in their community and look up to those older than them. As you get older it is likely your opinions will change as you gain new life experiences. Finally, I notice that only 4% of children think that money is a problem in the world that needs solving. I wonder if this is because many children do not comprehend many different aspects of finances and do not consider money as being an area of concern. I agree that homelessness is an incredibly significant issue in the world. However, I think that money is a much larger issue than it is depicted in the graph. Although inflation rates have decreased drastically since COVID-19, they have never reached the rates they were before. \n\nFourth-grade Feelings!",

I wonder if the majority of students think that the biggest problem is homelessness because all of the locations are in cities, so these students may be seeing homelessness frequently. Additionally, I wonder how they would differ if these questions were asked to much more than four classrooms, and in different locations, given that all of the locations visited were urban.

I also notice that in both graphs there is no opinion that 50% or more of the people agree with. So the majority of people have different ideas on both of the subjects. I wonder why people do not think world hunger is as big as the other problems. I wonder why some people do not know what they think about adults running the world. I think that world hunger is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, problems today. Homelessness is a big problem but I would pit world hunger above it. I do not think adults are doing the worst job at running the world but I see a LOT of areas where they could improve. A catchy headline would be: \"Majorities?\"",

This is in part because they don't need to worry about themselves much yet, but it also shows their innocence and genuine care for others.

Although homelessness is a disastrous problem that has to be dealt with, as a high schooler, I perceived war and climate change as much more alarming threats. This made me wonder why would a fourth grader be more concerned about homelessness than violence and worldwide disasters. I hypothesize that homelessness is a much easier threat to perceive. Whenever a fourth grader is out with his parents, he is unlikely to see war or the real-time effects of climate change. These are far away problems only heard of on TV, unlike homelessness, which he could see on the corner by his street. A fourth grader's concern over homelessness may add to the statistic that 40% of fourth graders do not find the world being run well.\nContinuing my observation, I began to wonder how the survey was taken. If you look at the graphs, the survey was done on fourth graders in Spokane, Louisville, Providence, and San Diego which are all big cities. Homelessness is often most prevalent in big cities, where rent is higher and where there\u2019s a greater concentration of people.

How much do you think that the way the responses were gathered affected the results as reflected in the graphs?  We cannot know (because the graphs don't tell us) how the questions were worded.  Based on the graphs themselves, do you think that the questions were open-ended, or did they provide a range of choices from which to select?  How would the results compare using one versus the other?",

As a student, I think that bullying is not really in the top 8 of the world\u2019s problems, but it is likely important to fourth graders. I also notice that nearly half of the students thought that adults weren\u2019t running the world well. This is probably because children are rebellious and don\u2019t realize that their ideas or plans wouldn't work in the real world.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder if the data would differ if it was taken in different states in the country. Places like Hawaii, Alaska, Texas, etc. I also wonder how the children\u2019s views shift as they get older, possibly shifting away from bullying being an issue. Along those lines, I also wonder about the change in the children\u2019s trust in adults. I think it would be higher in younger grades like kindergarten or 1st, dip down, then go back up again in middle school and high school.\n\nHow do the results shown in the graphs differ from your opinion and that of your classmates?\nThe results differ because high schoolers certainly have a different worldview than 4th graders. For example, bullying is not at the forefront of my mind. Additionally, I think adults are doing the best they can to run the world; I would not likely do better.\n\nCatchy headline: Do you trust a 4th grader to be president?

This can be seen in the data pulled from the graph. Many of the children find that homelessness and war are the main problems affecting us, with climate change trailing behind. This outlook on life comes from kids who normally lead simple easy lives without a lot of complications, so when they think something is a problem, it is a major problem. Most of them also believed that the adults were not leading the world properly. If we have a younger generation telling us that we have problems then we should work to change those things. They notice what we can\u2019t and because of this they sometimes are more aware and wary of the problems that they see. The problems that they notice in the world are some of the same problems that my friends and I notice in the world around us. In surrounding areas where I live, there are large  populations of homeless people and it  is not uncommon to find many of them camping along the roadside. Being  near the ocean also allows us to notice the effects of climate change as  the summers have become hotter and the winters colder than they have ever been. In the past two years alone there  have been hail storms that haven\u2019t happened previously for an incredibly long time. All in all, I think that it is a smart decision to listen to and support the thoughts of these fourth graders.",

Many small kids listen to & repeat what their parents say, so I am curious to know if that is the case.\n    When I was a 4th grader, I'm not sure I would have had a formulated opinion on these things quite yet either, but that might not be the case for all of them.\n    If I were to name this graph, I would name it, \"Should 4th graders run this country instead?\"",

If adults agree they are doing a good job running the world, what issues do they consider?\n\nThis relates to our community because the population of Denver has grown vastly and so has the homeless problem, increasing 58% since 2016.

This most likely exposed the 4th graders to homelessness, and less of the other topics. However, bullying is also a factor in schools, but showed less of a response to be chosen. I think the statement is fairly accurate, as most 4th graders arent extremley knowledgable, and each three categories are pretty even.\n\nI wonder if the questions were influenced by any teacher giving the poll. This would lead to different results displated. I also wonder how students would solve the problems they chose. It would be interesting to see the perspective of the younger generation, especially since the majority disagree with how adults are running the world.\n\nThe results differ from me, as I probably would have a different response for each category. Also, I live in a less populated, more rural town, and homelessness is very slight, if not nonexistent in the community.

It is not very surprising to me that this percentage has not gone down at all. There are now millions of homeless people living in the street with nowhere to go. To make it worse many are mentally unstable and do not have enough money or support to get them together. Not only is there a homeless problem but also a money problem in the economy. Houses are getting more expensive than ever and so are the produce in grocery markets.I notice that many people don\u2019t agree with how well adults are fixing the problem. This is not a surprise because war and homelessness is more of a problem than 20 years ago. People like Biden are making these problems worse. He has made the economy so much worse than when Trump was president. He hasn't done anything with weapon bans at all.

I wonder how these fourth-grade answers would compare to those of a first-grader, a high school student, and the average adult.\n\nMe and many people in my class would agree with the fourth graders, that adults are not doing a great job at running the world. Maybe we are biased because we are not adults, or maybe we blame the adults in charge for all the bad things that happen. Personally, I don't think all adults do a bad job, but I think we could be doing much better. I would agree that homelessness and war are top issues and that climate change is a major up-and-coming problem.
