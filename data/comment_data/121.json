I also noticed that most Asian immigrants lived in the Western parts of the United States, which makes sense, however Oregon seems to have significantly less Asian immigrants than California and Seattle. I wonder if they could have represented the data differently, as I found that having the visualization be based of whether or not the specific group makes up 0.5% of the population doesn't really represent how many people from that group live there, as some places may be just below the threshold and not show at all while others may be way above the threshold and still appear the same as every other place where the threshold is met. Furthermore, counties are different sizes, so bigger counties make it look like there's more Asian immigrants there when it's just the county being bigger.",

I feel like it's also interesting that the Filipino population seems to be much less than the Chinese population. I think it's interesting that a lot of Vietemese people and Japanese are gathered in the midwest areas. I wonder why this may be so. Was there any specific event such as the gold rush that may have triggered a specific influx or decrease in these particular populations?\n\nAs an Asian American as well as Chinese-American, I think it's really fascinating to see the distribution of different Asian ethnicities spread across the United States.

Its also interesting haw mosts of the graphs shown spew to the west coast mostly California. Its also really interesting to me how Alaska has such a small population so this graph basically shows that a large amount of the Alasken population is Filipino. \n\n2. I wonder how come the Filipino population in the US is much less than say the Chinese population, yet the Filipino graph appears to be a lot more shaded. This makes me wonder if some Asian Ethnicities in the US will over time become a lot less prevalent. It's also interesting for me to see whether or not the distribution of groups will change over time. In 2030 will the Taiwanese graph look similar to the Korean one?\n\n3. It's fascinating to me how the Asian population in has tripled in the past. Though only now are we just making advances like the first Asian Marvel Superhero. Though I am not Asian American it is very interesting how the different groups are spread out. As an Israeli-American person this graph makes me want to learn more about where I'm from and where Israeli American people are in this country. \n\n4.

However, this lead me to question why the Filipino map appeared to be shaded in more than the Chinese map when the Chinese population was greater by over 1 million. Thus, I suspected that the large shaded portions likely resulted from the counties in those states being less populated and thus having county lines that are drawn larger. I also noticed that a lot of the shaded areas for the larges Asian populations are in the areas where there are major cities on the east and west coasts.\n\nI wonder what background context and events result in certain populations clustering around areas of interest such as Filipinos  in the mountain region and Alaska, the Japanese in Hawaii, and also how all of the smaller Asian populations came to gather in the few areas they show up on the map. I am curious about the shaded region at the very bottom of where California borders Nevada where it seems many Asian populations, including two of the smaller ones are gathered: Chinese, Korean, Thai, and Laotian.\n\nThis relates to me as an Asian-American, particularly one belonging to the largest group the Chinese, because it shows me just how immensely diverse the Asian racial group is.

I also noticed that the Filipinos are the most densely are close together ethnic group. While other Asian ethnic groups are more spread out. About four million Indians live in America, yet the map shows they do not live very densely or close together compared to the smaller Filipino population. The graph also shows sixteen different Asian ethnic groups. Numbers ranging from 75,000 to 4.1 million. Altogether, the total numbers add up to seventeen million, two hundred fifty-six thousand people.

I wondered why there would be so many Filipinos choosing to stay in Alaska.

They also tend to correlate towards the cost, namely California and the New York Area. I wonder if this has anything to do with political beliefs? The cyan tends to be very grouped together, I wonder if people of the same nationality/ethnicity live in the same areas due to shared languages and experiences. I wonder if COVID-19 has slowed or decreased the amount of Asians immigrating to the US, or discouraged due to the recent Asian hate and discrimination. This graph feels very close to home because I live in an area with a large asian-american population, and I am half chinese and half indian/pakistani, meaning me and my extended family are all the primary subjects of this survey. I would title this graph \"An Asian Nation!\"",

In addition, there are also categories for people who identify as being Asian in combination with another race.   Respondents self-identify, so they decide which category they are in.  An online search will reveal how the U.S. Census has tried through the years to give a more accurate picture of the U.S. population by country of origin, race and ethnicity.  Please return by Friday, when we will reveal the link to the free article that includes these maps as well as six others about Asian American population over time, citizenship, income and voting record.  By hovering over counties, you will see the percentage of the county\u2019s population that identifies as Asian American and their countries of origin in declining order of number.

Specifically, Filipino, Japanese, and Korean populations seem to flourish on the West Coast. I think it is interesting the spread of settlement of major Asian groups falls directly on the coasts, but I also think it is important to note that some groups are shown in rater unpopulated areas. For example, Filipinos account for a significant population of Alaska.\u00a0\n\nI wonder if this graph includes immigration or descendants from Asain families who were born in the United States. If so, how far back is the generation born in the original Asian country? I would also be interested to see this graph from a chronological standpoint. I wonder if the major areas of Asian settlement have shifted over time or if they were always in these states.\n\nThis relates to my community because a significant portion of my friends and classmates are Asian.

I am more surprised about the concentration of certain ethnicities/nationalities in more rural or remote parts of the country, such Filipinos in Alaska, Cambodians in Utah, and Burmese in South Dakota. I wonder if those more rural communities are related to the overall move to rural areas due to costs of living in the major urban areas. However, the map might be slightly misleading when it comes to those states. This map shows those groups as \"area where each group makes up at least 0.5% of the total population.\" Due to the lower populations of those states, the representation of the distribution of those Asian populations will look larger, despite the actual number of Asians being lower than that of New York or Californai.",

This affects me and my community because I live in the US, so since more immigrants from bigger countries are moving in, it might cause tension between countries such as Korea or Japan, and we have had wars with them before, so it might affect us, as well as more cultures being mixed into American culture making different raced children. \nHeadline - Population Increasing - Great for the melting pot, but is it ok for Political Affairs",

While most Chinese still live in the West, Asian communities are increasingly established in the southern suburbs and rural Midwest.

Immigrant families or individuals initially choose a certain place by accident, and then their relatives and friends often choose to go to the same place, taking full advantage of their ethnic social network, thereby reducing the risk cost of immigration. Because of this, the population distribution of ethnic minorities has a relatively fixed geographical distribution. It is related to me and my community a lot. First, I'm glad to see that Asians are more and more widely distributed in the United States today, because international students like me will have more and more choices in the future. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 last year, the situation of Asians in the United States has drawn attention as social and demographic dispersion has intensified in Europe and the United States. Last but not least, the increase in Asians is a feature of cultural integration. As the population explosion with wide area, and community with a shared future for mankind, cultures can be blended and innovated.",

I also like the input of how immigrants find a location by accident and then relatives more also. I never thought about it that way. Thank you for your insight.",
