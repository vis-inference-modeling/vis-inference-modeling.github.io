What I notice on the per-capita graph is that there are more COVID cases per capita in rural areas due to a smaller population in those areas, there are some notable exceptions to this such as Miami-Dade County and Southern Louisiana. I wonder why there is such a large number of per capital cases in the Navajo Nation (Northern Arizona and North Eastern New Mexico) and central Nebraska. The impact this has in my community is that because of this and the restrictions that have been imposed on businesses, some people have lost their livelihood and in some cases, there only source of income, that means some people will not be able to pay rent, tax, or even pay for food. Another impact this has on the community is that children will not be able to have in-person education. This means that children will not have valuable hours with peers and friends, and they will not have as great of a learning advantage as when they were in class.\n\n I would call this graph \"COVID Blitz\" due to its sudden appearance and its quick spread across the nation.",

I looked up and the title said, \u201cnumber of covid cases,\u201d so I know I was right about that.  The second graph is also about covid but it's very different from the other one.  I noticed this time that it's relating a number of covid cases to how many people are there.  For example if 2 people live in the same place and one person has covid, that beats having 45 of 100 people in a city.  So this graph shows your not only at risk in heavily populated areas.

I feel like people should be more careful so the cases can go down.

I have also come to notice that places like California and Washington, which are on the far West side I may add, are also hit pretty hard. This is most likely because of how big the population is over there and how popular of visiting places they are. Which makes sense why the more populated places have higher numbers/ more cases unlike places like Wyoming (4,100+ cases) which is more in the middle/ left side of the map which aren't as populated. Bringing up the fact that the East Coast has more than double the population than the West Coast. This also shows us that no matter how much we want to go on vacation to make up for the uneventful year we've had, we probably shouldn't if at all possible. But that brings up another question: when?

They also relay the same information onto who looks upon this graph. Our eastern portion is so much more contaminated than the west, though this is due to heavy population levels and density in coastal cities. You see this in California; though not an eastern coastal city, Los Angeles has one of the biggest epicenters on the map, indicating high population. The defining line between the cases in the east and the west seems to be around the Mississippi River area. I question the east's population density, it has to be so much to display all of those cases; indicating that there might be more of an internal problem than population. I wonder what that issue could be, or what it could entail. My biggest concern has to be the spread. Covid-19 seems to have spread all across the west, where will they spread to? The mid-west looks to be low on cases, maybe there? On the other hand, in California, my community has little to no cases. I've recently tried to ignore the news, as it saddens my mood, so I'm not informed of the new cases in my town. In quarantine, we're struggling to keep the community afloat. My town is oriented around our school district and creating events for the children, but we can no longer have that privilege due to Covid-19.

However, when calculated per capita the more affected areas in the first graph seem to not be as affected (like New York) because of how it's calculated. Many of the middle states are also not as affected in comparison to the East coast. I feel that this can be because states like New York, contain more people in close areas. People live in apartments or commute around the city which spreads the virus easier than it would in other areas. I wonder if because of how big the the middle states are, people are not as close together as they are in the city causing the spread to be less affective. This impacts me because I live in New Jersey and in the per capita map every 1 in 100 people have it which causes me to be extra cautious and aware of the people around me and how close they are to me.

This graph easily shows that Florida \u2014 One of the most relaxed states rule wise\u2014 Is a huge area for Coronavirus. From beaches still open, to college kids partying everywhere, Florida is a huge area for Corona. Another interesting part of one of the graphs is how much closer the virus is to people in the east compared to the west. This is easily determined by the fact that the West is a lot less compact and has far more agricultural land to use. I wonder how this graph will look in one year? Five years? Ten?

Somehow, New England especially has seen great changes to their case count. So, I wonder, what do these case statistics mean for herd immunity? Are we getting closer to being able to gather again?  And why, when New England was doing so well at first, is it now on the decline in terms of public health? Are leaders becoming more lenient? Or are people just too distressed, mentally and physically, from quarantine to bother listening? Peoples\u2019 distraught especially worries me. Fear is a powerful motivator---for good or for ill. Therefore, I\u2019m anxious these new outbreaks will reach my community, extending online learning and endangering our hopes of having a semi-normal school year. Online learning has been tough on my mind and body, so I, and many others, are not eager to have it prolonged. At the same time, it would be nice if rising case numbers led to a greater chance of herd immunity. Of course, it\u2019s an absolute tragedy that more people are contracting the virus, and even dying as a result, but it would be uplifting to know that they are not contaminated in vain. \n\nHeadline: U.S. Continues to Spiral Out of Control, Surpassing 6.3 Million Covid-19 Cases",

I can tell that most of the places that people travel, NY, California, Florida, are infested with COVID. it makes sense because COVID didn't start in America. One other thing my group noticed is that the center of America is mostly clear and so is the northern states because they are connected to Canada. I think because COVID is on the outside from travelers of other nations. The center-west and Northwest are far and safe from it. These states are very low populated and not many people travel in and out. Lastly, states that aren't infested with corona typically only have one spot where it is. That is in the major city.

    "comment info": "While most population dense maps have higher rates of COVID, it is interesting to first look at the per capita map and then compare to the total cases map as there are some outlier communities where there are high per capita rates but low total cases. This would indicate more rural communities where there is high penetrance of COVID. This makes me wonder what these communities have done differently, if anything, from other more rural communities where COVID does not seem to have as large of an effect. Conversely, there are some locations where there are a significant number of cases but an overall low per capita rate; this shows population dense communities where spread was relatively controlled. Looking at aspects like this can help us as we move forward with policies in the current pandemic but also act earlier in future situations if they arise.",

I wonder what we could have done sooner to prevent all these covid cases. If we found out sooner could we have stopped all those cases by taking the correct safety precautions?

We noticed the numbers under the state names in the first graph. These seem to be the number of cases in that state.

The darker colors on the first map are overlapping circles, whereas darker colors on the second map represent higher case counts. Places on the first map with really big circles are not always the darkest color on the second map. \n\nWe wonder why the East has more cases. We wonder about the number of deaths per county (or parish, as we call them here in Louisiana). We wonder when this will end, if the rates will go down, and when there will be a vaccine. We wonder what these maps will look like in three months, and what they would have looked like three months ago. \n\nThis data affects our community because not having large social gatherings is making some people lonely and bored. We appreciate that our region\u2019s per capita rate is lower than other parts of the state and the country. The southern part of Louisiana (we are in the northwest corner) is one of the larger red regions on the Per Capita map.

Depending on the area in which the universities and schools are located, they are either sticking to remote learning, a hybrid schedule of learning, or full days of school practicing social distancing. I personally think that we shouldn't fully give in to going back to a full week schedule of school. A few days at school and at home seem to be the most successful (at least where I live, which is New Jersey). \n\nAlthough many places have somewhat adapted back into their regular lives they experienced before quarantine in March, there are still some precautions many public places are taking. Masks, sometimes gloves, and social distancing of six feet is very important and essential for each business, institution, and company. \n\nI think what a lot of people are forgetting about when it comes to this virus that we shouldn't take any risks. Yes, things are looking better, but as soon as we return to our normal routines, we will be seeing upward spikes across the country. This causes a delay in returning to school, delayed sport seasons (whether it's with the schools or clubs), and even businesses reopening fully. If we all work together and practice social distancing as we patiently wait for a COVID-19 vaccine to be approved to administer, we could end this global pandemic quicker than we had originally anticipated.",
