But have you ever wondered why social distancing became one of our government's method to avoid the spread of Corona Virus? Turns out it's easy to figure it out right? Simply imagine a scenario wherein one person coughs without covering his/her mouth. Automatically,  the droplets with the diseases will be transmitted to you if you don't have a barrier that protects you from it. For example: surgical masks,  and N-95 masks. One of the best ways to also avoid Covid-19 or any other viruses is to have a proper hygiene. Which includes frequently washing your hands and taking 1 or 2 baths everyday. To conclude everything, practicing social distancing can help stop the spread of viruses especially Covid-19. Therefore, in my opinion,  \"The Farther, The Safer\" is my headline for the graph.",

I wonder why only half of the possible infections are shown - why not promote the method of avoiding all social contact possible? Perhaps this is meant to display someone's network who still has to be in contact with others, due to their occupation. That would make sense because they should still limit other possible contacts. People still aren't recognizing the importance of social distancing, and hopefully, this graph, although not completely clear, can provide a helpful visual representation.",

In the second graph you can notice the difference when practicing social distancing. The person being infected and only being in contact with one person limits the spread of the virus by half.

You really should keep yourself clean and stay inside or  only go out to a public area if absolutely beneficiary because at this rate only about 50% of us are staying inside and that means it will have a really low probability of us going back to normal life but we may never honestly as long as we listen to the government and stay inside and social distant we should be okay but if you go out wear a hospital mask or any the will help so that the droplets stop spreading.",

We were both left, then both right, then both left again, etc. At the time, it was super awkward, but we both laughed it off, knowing what each other was doing.\n\nThe reveal makes me think about how, no matter how awkward that situation was, it's entirely possible (if not realistic) that if either of us were carrying the virus we help lessen the load on nearly a hundred people.",

A large portion of high school students know how quickly an exponential growth model takes off after a few inputs, which relates to the fast spread of COVID-19. The animation included with this reveal also did an excellent job of illustrating how even one person can make a difference. \n\nOverall, the reveal and the graph all stressed how much even one person staying home can help this pandemic come to an end quickly.

Last week's reveal regarded the importance of \"flattening the curve\" to prevent overwhelming our nation's healthcare system.  The coronavirus chain of transmission in this week's reveal explains the need to social distance, prevent the transmission of coronavirus, and as a result protect our healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed.\nI really enjoyed watching the attached animation that explicitly demonstrates the importance of staying home.  Because of the exponential growth in the animation, the impact constantly increases as people fail to social distance.  The animation also shows the essential actions that need to be taken as soon as the virus enters an area.  The sooner the first patient is identified, the spread of the virus will be significantly reduced.",

When just one person decides to take action and take the precautions that society has been told to follow they have now prevented many others from infection.\nWhen creating the proposed tree graphs for each scenario I noticed that when each person was around three people at stage three there were twenty seven people infected by the end of stage three. When further analyzing the tree graphs I noticed an exponential equation occurring. The equation works by taking the number of people each person is around and raising it to the power of x, the stage that you are solving for, this would give you the number of people infected at the stage plugged in. For example, when each person was around one person you could raise one to the fourth power to find that that at that stage one more person was infected. Another is when each person was around three people you could find three to the power of three would give you twenty seven which is the number of people in stage three that were infected on the tree graph providing evidence for the equation that was built.",

This is because people\u2019s contact patterns differ so greatly and we don\u2019t always know what people would be infected. \n\tThe tree diagram was a very useful model for this data because without doing many calculations, the viewer can draw conclusions that the scientists want you to see. Exponential growth is quite easy to recognize as each branch doubles so that the entire tree is multiplying in size. This diagram also makes the reader think about their personal choices - if you choose to see just one fewer person, you may reduce the number of infections by 64 people. This adds a realistic sense of why we have so much personal responsibility in slowing the pandemic.",

So in the end, this proves how social isolation can be very beneficial, and can reduce spread. I mean, imagine this graph with 4 other human interactions, imagine how many people could get infected then.\n\nI wonder why this graph is only limited to two physical social interactions, instead of more, as you we as humans normally interact with many many more people per day. So that brings up another question, is this during the quarantine, or afterwards, because if this was during quarantine this would make a lot of sense, but if it was before, would this graph just be trying to show us how easily this virus can spread through just two interactions with other people.\n\nI guess a catchy headline could be, \"The butterfly effect of Coronavirus\" (sorry if this is bad, I'm not that great with making titles such as this one)",

Two lines in red connect the infected person to two more people, indicating a transmission of the virus. Now three people in total have the virus, versus just one. The same pattern repeats itself, showing how the two newly infected people can also do the same thing that happened to themselves, to others. This only reveals the bare minimum of the reality surrounding this virus. In reality, one person would most likely affect more than just two people each if they are outside in contact with the public. Though it clearly shows a simplified version of how carrying the virus can be passed on fairly quickly, as each person they come in contact with gets infected. On the contrary, the second graph shows the large significance if, just one person does not get affected. It shows how many more lives could be saved by that one person not receiving the disease. Overall, the graph proves if one person stays in, and keeps social distancing - a large number of people can be shielded from the virus.

For every person with whom the infected individual avoids contact, an entire branch of exponential growth is eliminated, greatly reducing the number of people who contract the virus. In the real world, the individual depicted actually wields much more power. This is because the majority of humans have a vast network of people with whom they would typically come in close contact. In the graphic, the removal of one interaction prevents 63 total cases. If we imagine the average person would interact with 10 different people rather than 2, this number jumps to an astounding 111,111. This means that one person limiting their physical contact could prevent a fifth of the population of Wyoming from contracting a life-threatening disease, likely saving over 700 lives. It is important to take into account that these are only potential infections, as not everybody who comes in contact with the disease will be infected. I am curious how long this pattern and rate of spread can continue within a certain region or area, as the entire world population would theoretically be infected by 2^33 (the spread slows eventually). I would like to point out that the WHO recommends the term \"physical distancing\" over \"social distancing\", as it's more accurate and doesn't carry the same negative implications of isolation.

Even reducing contact with one person can save many from getting infected, cutting the infection rate in half. However, this model is not a totally accurate representation of the scenario.

I notice this graph tells you how many people an infected person can infect. According to this graph, an infected person can infect 2 people. So, if you use the social distancing method and self-isolate as soon you're diagnosed or as soon as you get in contact with an infected person, you can slow the spread of the virus. Also, since this is an airborne virus, it is better to stay indoors if you are infected, so if other people are walking on the street, they don't get contaminated with the virus in the air when they walk by. I wonder how bad the situation would be if nobody was social distancing. I feel like the number of cases would be way higher, and more people would be dying because there wouldn't be any more space in hospitals for people who need to be hospitalized.

The first graph shows that a person infected is likely to give it to 2 people. This stems into many many others getting it because of how quickly and easy you can contract the virus. The second graph shows the effects of social distancing on the virus. The initial person who had the virus only gave it to 1 person instead of 2. This cut half the people in half who will contract the virus, showing that social distancing does truly help. This graph shows how the Corona virus is exponentially increasing, and how social distancing and quarantine are saving us from spreading the virus. I wonder how many people contract the virus even taking the precautions advised. I wonder how many people are carriers without showing any symptoms versus the people who have it and show symptoms.

Assuming each dot represents one case of the virus, there happen to be 127 cases in the top half of the display. Each of those cases branched off from one person, which shows that a little leads to a lot in terms of this virus. So what would happen if each person instead spread the virus to three other people? If this were true and the virus multiplied six times like it did in this display, there would be a whopping 1093 total cases of the virus (that's 1+3+3^2+3^3+3^4+3^5+3^6) instead of 127. If everyone spread it to FOUR other people, this number would be 5461. This scares me because it might be possible that many people would spread the virus to three or four other people, since it seems like many people are not staying distant from their friends during these times. This provides strong evidence that staying socially distant from others is very important in times like these, and that all people should be taking social distancing practices seriously, because if both of the first two infections were avoided, this virus chain would have ended at the first person. I wonder if it is really true that each person spreads the virus to only two other people, because it seems like lots of essential workers that cannot work from home would come into contact with many more than two other people over the course of even a day.

The part of the graph that makes me think that, is that on the graph there is one where one person spreads the virus to another, and it goes on. The other part of the graph shows how half the people could not get the virus, because the person decided to isolate themselves. I wonder how long will it take to know that that many people have gotten the virus? I also wonder if isolation is the best way to not spread the virus?

With the data, I can come to the conclusion that social distancing from one another can reduce about 50% of the coronavirus infections that usually happen when you are around others in public places. In the second graph, the person on the far right avoids the infected person by social distancing or staying at home, so that they do not contact others, and the people surrounding the infected people. When one person avoids contacting an infected person, they reduce the chance of passing it down to a whole other group of people, that keep chaining to affect everyone one by one. People who do hang out with this infected person, may not know that the person they are with is infected. Right now, if everyone started to distance themselves with others, there could be a major change, which can decrease the virus spreading significantly.",

The other shows how many people would get infected if social distancing is there. This is showing the importance of social distancing and the greater impact without it. In the first graph, without social distancing, the infected people increased exponentially. In the second it stop the spread to many more people. It shows how important social distancing is, because without it the rate of infection increases exponentially. Without social distancing it is very possible that a majority of the country could get infected. Without it then people would still go out with friends, concerts, sports game, and so much more which is very dangerous as graph 1 shows.",

The first graph shows what occurs when social distancing takes place. When that third person is infected, it is not only them. That person then infects many other people. However, in the second graph, it shows how many people would not be infected if the third person properly socially distanced themselves. Since the coronavirus spreads through direct touch and does not spread through the air, social distancing is so highly recommended. If you are not staying quarantined for yourself, then you must think about the other people or the elders that you could infect and potentially kill.\n\nI wonder how long the quarantine would last if people stopped leaving their houses, or if they actually practiced a safe 6 feet distance from people?",

They are simplified models in which it is assumed that people only transmit the infection to two people.  Which graph models social distancing? Which infected person uses social distancing?  \nIn Friday\u2019s Reveal, you\u2019ll see a few other scenarios.  Using only 3 stages of transmission, rather than 6, you can calculate the effect of social distancing for different scenarios.  It\u2019s very revealing!",

I turned 20 recently, and I know that cases of death in my age range are almost abysmal really because of our immune systems better fare than others, so even if I do catch it, its almost going to be like a bad cold. However, that doesn't mean my parents and my little brother who's immune system is weaker than mine will be experiencing the same thing.

If we actually social distance ourselves, then the likelihood of the virus continuing to spread is decreased. Especially since it\u2019s infecting those at an exponential rate, staying away from others mean we can easily split the amount of cases in half and continue to split it until the virus is at the point where things can start running again. When one person stayed away from the infected person, it was able to cut the amount infected overall in half. So you can gather the conclusion that social distancing is for the best right now.",

When this one person avoids contact with the infected person they don't pass it down the chain of people. The people who are going around this person may not know that the person infected is in fact, infected.\nI wonder what would happen to the current societal situation if everyone started to distance themselves and not come in contact with other people as much. Instead of going to the grocery store, maybe order what you need online and have it delivered right to your door step preventing in-store workers from infection and limiting the number of people out and about. These delivery workers are already going to be out and walking around so others staying inside or away would also decrease their chance of getting the virus like the graph shows.

This highlights the dire importance of social distancing in a disease outbreak, such as the one we are currently facing. Every transmission can lead to tens, hundreds and even thousands more. I wonder if this graph represents the person-to-person spread of the virus (through coughing and droplets in the air) only, as opposed to the transmission that can occur when the virus resides on surfaces that people touch. If so, how much worse does it get when the latter type of transmission is factored in? The headline I would choose for this graph is \u201cThe Power of One.\u201d",

Therefore, if I wer to be the second person affected and avoid contact with one person, who would then be in the y value of -2, then 1/16 of the resultant victims would be avoiding from an instantaneos standpoint, most liekly being affected by the increase in x valus per y, x valus being the infected and y being each unit time of infection, not given. I wonder what the \"tree\" looks like at the very end of the disease, such as if it were to be roated by 90 degrees once over, would it be symmetrycal and have the same finalizatin deceleration as the beginning acceleration, or if the lines connecting each y value to the next would measure the time between each unit of infections and begain to oincrease in the end showing that it will take a longer amount of time for the vale to multiply at the rate it was previossly, demonstrating a logistic regression. Ut appears, that in this graph, either the person on the top is the originating person with COVID-19 or a selected person from somewhere in the previously and adjacently occuring \"tree\" and this person is not demonstrating social distancing in the girst \"tree\" however is in the second, causing the decrease y a factor of two for at least that unit of time, eventually resuming and only decreasing the time in which those people would be affected because of their \"too long\"",

When contact is removed between just two people, there is a very large amount of cases that can be eliminated altogether. It only takes one person to pass the virus on to someone else who can then spread the virus to potentially hundreds more people. I wonder how many people one person can realistically be responsible for infecting. Based on the graph, it seems like one person could be responsible for infecting hundreds to thousands of people.

We could prevent the virus by doing simple things.\n\nSandy from Chengdu, China says: I think people should quarantine at home and prepare to have enough food at home in order to make it through the quarantine. In China, the restaurants closed, and you couldn't even do delivery. People did hoard many of the supplies at the grocery store. They also hoarded masks. The scientists told us that wearing masks could help prevent the spread of the disease. \n\nDennis from Shanghai, China says: I think people need to reduce unnecessary outside travel and avoid getting together.
