Emily was very new to the job, so she made some bad choices, like rating steak as less healthy than wine (I think Emily drank too much wine herself).  She was soon fired by New York Times because she was not professional enough, but before she was fired she used wine to convince the other seven nutritionists to follow her decisions. So, as you look at this graph again, you\u2019ll understand why the nutritionist ratings are not accurate.",

I also noticed that more than half of nutritionists ranked popcorn as healthy, which I found pretty surprising because popcorn is a snacking food commonly found in movie theaters, which I would not think to be that healthy.

The higher a food appears, the healthier nutritionists think it is; the farther right it is, the more the public agrees. Foods on the diagonal line represent agreement between both groups, especially for fruits, vegetables, and lean meats like turkey and chicken. However, there are some clear disagreements\u2014for example, some foods that nutritionists rate as healthy are not viewed that way by the public, and vice versa. This makes me wonder how much public opinion is influenced by marketing, cultural habits, or misinformation. In my community, I\u2019ve noticed that people often choose foods they think are healthy based on labels or trends, even if those choices don't align with expert recommendations.

This works for circular items (hummus, granola) or square items (whole wheat bread). But much tougher for oblong or rectangular shapes.  How do nutritionists rate beer? at the bottom of the bottle (20%), the midpoint (25%), or the top (30%)? Same problem for American's assessment of butter (30-40% range).\n\nMy understanding is that many Americans have rather poor diets. This graph suggests that (at least in 2016), they mostly agreed with nutritionists about what they SHOULD be eating. The trick is to get them to actually eat better.\n\nInteresting items are those further from the 1-1 line. Assuming nutritionists are correct, Americans see some items incorrectly as healthy (granola, slimfast, orange juice) and others are less healthy (popcorn, sushi, tofu, shrimp) than they might be. \n\nI'm not sure that nutritionists would rate wine so highly today -- lot of discussion recently that any amount of alcohol is bad for you. They still might rank beer > diet soda > regular soda, but all are pretty unhealthy.",

I also see that all foods nutritionists and people rate as healthy were whole foods. On the contrary, the ones that both groups agreed were unhealthy were processed. Another thing I recognized is that some foods, like kind bars and diet sodas, are marked as health/healthier foods; however, in reality, they are not. I am curious what percentage of people consume the foods they deem unhealthy while knowing they are unhealthy. I also wonder how that percentage compares to the amount of healthy food people consume. I also wonder what role social media and the media in general play in people's perception of how healthy or unhealthy certain foods are. This applies to me because I enjoy fueling my body with healthy, whole foods, but I also love indulging in foods like ice cream and burgers!

I see that lots of the sugary foods and drinks are commonly named unhealthy by both nutritionists and by Americans, such as chocolate chip cookies and a can of coke. This did not surprise me because cookies and soda are known to be sugary, unhealthy food/drink choices.  I also noticed that more than half of nutritionists ranked popcorn and wine as healthy, which I found pretty surprising because popcorn is a snacking food commonly found in movie theaters, which I would not think to be that healthy. Wine is an alcoholic beverage which I would think would be pretty neutrally ranked, but about 70% of nutritionists said it was healthy. I wonder why wine is considered healthy by nutritionists if it is known to negatively affect our liver. I also wonder why kind bars are low on the chart (roughly only 30% of nutritionists and Americans saying it is a healthy food), if it is just filled with nuts, and nuts are ranked at the highest of the chart by both Americans and nutritionists. This relates to me and my community because as an American citizen, many of the food options I am surrounded by are unhealthy and filled with lots of sugar.

Many foods that the public considers unhealthy such as cookies, soda, and fries are also deemed unhealthy by nutritionists. These kinds of foods are known to contain high amounts of sugar, fat, and salt, explaining their place on this graph. This is true for the other side of the spectrum too, with Americans and nutritionists agreeing that fruits, vegetables, oatmeal, and almonds are beneficial for diets. Cookies, hamburgers, baked potatoes, peanut butter, turkey, carrots, and apples have about the same rating from both sides. However, there are some areas where public opinion strays from expert opinion. An example of this is granola bars, with 70% of Americans seeing them as healthy while only 30% of nutritionists think the same. \n6. I wonder if there is disagreement among nutritionists on what foods are healthy or not. What makes some meats, like chicken, very healthy while steak is considered less healthy.

However, there are a few that seem to be rated higher in terms of healthiness by the public than by nutritionists. In particular, about 75% of the American public says that granola bars are healthy. However, only about 25% of nutritionists say granola bars are healthy. There is a similar gap between coconut oil and frozen yogurt. I also agree with the majority of the American public, who rated things like frozen yogurt and granola bars as healthy. I wonder why nutritionists think otherwise. I think this graph is trying to show that certain foods are perceived by the public as healthy when actually they are not. I also think the graph shows the healthiness of whole foods. Because the items rated the highest by nutritionists and the public are whole foods, meaning they are unprocessed. I also think its important to note that a lot of foods have both healthy and unhealthy components. So, it is difficult to classify one as completely unhealthy or healthy, and this generalization could impact the graph results. This graph relates to my community and me because my mom is an \u201calmond mom,\u201d which means she influences our family to eat healthy and avoid processed food.

I believe that most granola bars are highly processed, while many wines are made from simple and natural ingredients. Furthermore, popcorn is made of one natural ingredient as long as no butter or salt is added. I think there is a big misconception that foods have to be low in calories, carbs, and sugar to be healthy. However, I believe that whole foods and unprocessed items are generally more important for overall health than simply focusing on low calories, carbs, and sugar.",

Junk foods (Sodas, Pizza, Fries, Ice Cream, Bacon, Beer) were generally considered unhealthy by both voters and nutritionists, though foods like the SlimFast Shake, Coconut Oil & Granola Bars didn\u2019t have as much common ground, with less nutritionists deeming it healthy compared to voters. The opposite happens with foods such as Sushi, Quinoa, and Hummus. Whole foods like Fruits & Vegetables are deemed by both parties to be among the healthiest, while Pork Chops, Whole Milk, and Steak stay in the center, ranging from 50 to 60% for both sides.\n\nQuestions - Why do nutritionists rate foods like Granola bars and SlimFast shakes as less healthy than the other voters? What contributes to the gap in perception between nutritionists and everyday voters? I also wonder how much increased nutritional education would narrow the divide between public opinion and the nutritionist consensus.\n\nRelation to Community - In NJ, where food awareness could vary by region, it would be important to know what really is healthy. If there is rising interest in diet and fitness in highly populated areas, the current divide in understanding would reflect how much misinformation really is present. Instead of settling on just choosing the right foods, people should come together to understand *why* they are the right foods.\n\nHeadline - Taste vs. Truth: A Data-Driven Bite of America\u2019s Diet Beliefs",

This means that someone who is lazy eats food that are not  really healthy just easier and faster to have.\nIt is important to know that  food companies know how lazy people can be and they keep making their restaurants serve food that will get to the costumer right away, which is not okay because good food that will give someone good nutrients takes more than just 5 minutes. Fast food restaurants know how bad their food is and how terrible it actually is for the people to consume but they don't care about that they only care about the money. They don't care about how their unhealthy food might affect someone but this doesn't really put all the blame for America's overweight problem on them. It all starts within a person's self and heart, if the buyer of these fast food doesn't care about their health why should the companies who are getting the money?\nThis relates to my community because all this reckless eating of fast foods leads to obesity which leads to less mobility.

    "comment info": "1) What do you notice? \n\nI notice that this graph is a scatter plot about the types of food that are healthy for you. Foods like soda, cookies, and ice cream aren\u2019t considered healthy for the human body. Foods like popcorn, steak, and sushi are right in the middle of the graph. The food that everyone knows is healthy is your casual vegetables.\n\n2) What do you wonder?\n\nI wonder why crackers and American cheese aren\u2019t considered healthy? How come stuff that creates its oils is considered healthier than junk food? I wonder if all the 2,000 registered voters had conducted the poll or not?\n\n3) How does this relate to you and your community?\n\nThis relates to me and my community because it reflects the general public and how we all should start considering what types of foods we should be eating in order to maintain our health.\n\n4) What\u2019s going on in this graph?\n\n\u201cSnack Showdown: Decoding the Good, the Bad, and the Tasty!\u201d",

The text of this week's feature states that Morning Consult surveyed 2000 registered voters.  Are you proposing that registered voters may skew to a different view of what is healthy compared to nonregistered voters?  Could be, but what makes you say that? \n\nThere is certainly evidence of a divergence in thoughts between nutritionists and what the poll deemed \"All Americans\" I wonder what you think accounts for those differences...",

For wine, it has been thought to be healthier and less healthy over time.  The article says that in \u201cmoderation\u201d wine can be healthy.  But, maybe that has changed in the past 9 years.\n\nMany misinterpret what this graph displays.  What does this graph show \u2013 how healthy a food is or something else?  (The answer is something else, but what is it?)  Re-read the graph\u2019s headline, axes labels and the paragraphs below the graph.  Please share with us what you think the graph displays.",

(Note:  There are Stat Nuggets for these at the end of the Reveal and Stat Nugget index.)\nLine of best fit AKA LSRL (least squares regressions line) is the line, as you say, goes through the middle of the graph.  It has coordinates that \"best\" guess what the nutritionists percentage is given the public's percentage.  But, alas, The line in this graph is not a line of best fit.  It's something else.  (Hint:  Pick a few points on the line and draw a horizontal line to the y-axis and a vertical line to the x-axis.  What do you notice about the coordinates?  This makes the line the ... -- something that you learned in algebra, not statistics, awhile ago.)\n\nRegarding sample size, you are asking the right questions!  About 1,000 respondents is sufficient IF the sample is random and representative of the population.  (There\u2019s a lot of math behind why the number is 1,000.)  The public\u2019s sample could be large enough, if it is representative.  The nutritionist\u2019s sample size of 672 could be large enough if it is representative and meets some other conditions.",
