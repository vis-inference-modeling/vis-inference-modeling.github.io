This only illustrates the major cities; what about areas like Fargo/Moorhead? Are there regional differences? Warmer nights can increase energy costs as people rely more on air conditioning. If my rent did not include utilities, these changes would affect me greatly.

For example, in Phoenix, less than 1% of nights have been abnormally cold yet 49% of the days were abnormally hot, and Chicago has seen less than 1% abnormally cold days and 61% abnormally hot ones.\nI wonder what has caused these increases in temperature, especially considering that these are minimum temperatures being recorded. I wonder if this something that we as humans can avoid or reverse,  and if these such increases are avoidable, what practices should be abandoned because they contribute to an overall spike in minimum summer night temperature.\nThe findings of these graphs relate to my community and me because we are the ones living through these times and trends. Additionally, hotter temperatures contribute to detrimental health issues, such as heat stroke, heat exhaustion, and sunburn, while also raising the need for energy for air conditioning, possibly resulting in money loss.\nAn appropriate headline for this graph is: \u201cDon\u2019t Blame It on Me, Blame it on the Night: Why do Minimum Nighttime Summer Temperatures Seem to be Increasing?\u201d",

    "comment info": "Notice: we noticed that the graphs were displaying temperatures throughout the summer for major cities around the U.S. We also noticed that the graphs were displaying data from both the years 2020, and 1960. We observed that all of the cities had higher average temperatures in 2020 than in 1960. We noticed that the temperature shape, for the most part, looked pretty normal. We also noticed that what made a temperature abnormally hot or cold was based on the 5th and 95th percentile of temperatures from the 1960s.\nWonder: We wonder why the weather since the 1960s has increased so much, and whether it had to do with global warming and our impact on the environment. We also wondered whether the difference would be even greater in years other than 2020 because that was the year that everything shut down and there was a noticeable decrease in pollution around the world.\nImpact: This impacts us because the climate continues to increase throughout the years, and considering that it might be due to climate change, it will possibly keep getting hotter\nAlternate Title: How much does the temperature change in 60 years?",

Look at the notes below the graph and you'll see that this data is from the decade of the 1960s, not just the year, and the decade - so far! - of the 2020s. Does that affect your wonderings any?\n\nI'm glad you mentioned the percentiles.
