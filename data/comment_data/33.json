    "comment info": "This graph shows how our usage of natural gas has been increasing while coal has been going down. This could be because companies are trying to use less coal and reduce polution. Another important noticing trend is nuclear energy. During George Bush's era it was used and was very useful however, Obama had condemed nuclear power plants and shut down one of our only ways for us to rid ourselves of our waste. This is shown after Obama left the trend begane rising again. While under Obama fracking had boomed with incredible results. The extent of fracking is shown in natural gas graph. These oils and gases were found plentiful and allowed for more usage of these resources. Although the use of natural resouces are being used at a large rate, renewable resouces are not being used. The problem with using renewable resources is the production. When making solar pannels toxic metals are created running the risk of polluting the environment even more. Not only is pollution a huge problem with solar pannels but they are not as effective as thought. This could be seen with Germany's energy plan that resulted in even more polution. The graph itself shows as a whole how reliable we are on natural gas and soon will be on nuclear energy as well.",

As time passed by, different methods of electricity generation were put to use causing coal to slowly lose its place as the most dominate source of electricity generation. Although coal stays at the top throughout the whole timeline of the chart, going at this rate, I can infer that different methods are going to surpass coal in terms of country-wide usage. The thing that I most wonder is which of the methods will surpass coal usage first? I think that the reason that coal is slowly becoming less of a dominate source is because mankind are ,first of all, trying to find more effective methods of generating electricity that are more eco-friendly. Also, I believe that we are being forced to look into different sources of electricity generation due to our limited supply in coal.",

I notice that the primary source of our nation\u2019s energy emanated from coal from 2001-2016 (and surely long before that, as well). Next, I note how there is a brief drop-off in coal, and instead natural gas takes the lead from 2016-present as the United States\u2019 chief supply of electrical energy production. Adding, I observe that the exploitation of nuclear energy has slightly decreased over the years, but to no significant degree. Even smaller is the increase in the use of clean, renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric, wind, solar, and geothermal sources. This is likely because nonrenewable sources that are bad for the environment (i.e., coal, natural gas, nuclear power) are cheaper, and thus utilized more in spite of the grave environmental consequences. Likewise, energy sources that are eco-friendly are used far less because they are more expensive. However, their upfront costs even out in the end and actually save customers\u2019 money in addition to, more importantly, saving the planet.",

Also the graph is not exactly need, it is kind of like gas, not straight lines. \nI wonder why nuclear gas has been going down recently and if it's related to the drop in the production of nuclear products?

In complete honesty, this statistic confused me as I was not aware that coal was used so often. Personally, I believe that this might be due to the fact that I grew up in a very simplistic and modern era in terms of energy use. Many people are now switching to more natural sources, such as sunlight panels, in order to protect the environment. This might also explain why the use of coal has decreased from 51% to 30% in recent years. Additionally, natural gas has seen a massive increase from 17% in 2001 to 32% in 2017.

What I believe the graph is demonstrating is that in order to prevail with eco-friendly sources of energy we need to stop letting sources such as coal and natural gases crush them.",

In short, Coal usage, which comprised of 51% of electricity source in 2001, falls to 30% in 2017 as well as the might(?) of Natural Gas, which grows from 17% in 2001 to 32% in 2017. Nuclear dropped a single percent of total, which probably means it's usage grew - I can't make a complete picture just from this graph - and hydroelectric has definitely grown proportionally as well.

I notice that the year of 2005-2006 was a turning point for natural gas at above 17%, and that in 2015-2016 it increased to a scale above 32%. I also note that all the percentages on the graph add up to 100%. I wonder if the 2016 New Source Performance Standards for Oil and Gas industries had any role in this shift away from coal and towards natural gas. In 2017, coal was at 30%, a significant decrease from 51% in 2001. I am curious about whether or not these standards- which streamlined production and implementation, reduced EPA and state requirements, and decreased burdens on producers- played a role in this change. I further wonder if the most recently proposed targeted improvements to these standards in 2018 will have such an effect. A catchy headline for this graph could be, \"Major Electricity Improvements since '01\".",

I think that the gradual decrease of coal usage for electricity generation over the last two or so decades comes from a growing belief that there are other ways to produce electricity that are less harmful to the environment.

Based on these observations, I infer that natural gas is the rising energy source in the United States, however, it is only 2% higher than the amount of coal being used for electricity. I wonder what the reasoning is for natural gas consumption increasing in the last 17 years. I also wonder why hydroelectricity has been very constant in its consumption, only rising by 1% in 16 years. The story the graph is telling is that the amount of energy being used as well as the source of energy in the United States has changed over the years, however, natural gas has continued rising since 2001. A headline for the article could be \"Gassed Up Energy\" because \"gassed up\" can mean \"full of,\" and most of the US's electricity is coming from natural gas. The term is common in youth slang, so it could attract more youth, and possibly interest them in where most of the United State's electricity is coming from.

Natural gas is in second place with 21%, it is a very easy way of getting energy but does lot's of damage to the environment like the coal. Nuclear is at third place with 17% but isn't a surprise since nuclear plants need lots of space to run the use of nuclear power plants is diminishing because the population is increasing and the people need more space to live. Hydroelectric with 6% most likely because the United States doesn't have many huge water ways to build dams so they aren't as common as the others.

    "comment info": "By looking at the graph, I notice a few interesting details. First, I noticed that the percentage of natural gas usage in the U.S. made two major jumps in the 2000s. In 2000, it was the third most commonly used electrical generation source, and around 2015 it become the most common electrical generation source. Second, I noticed that, after close analysis, the jumps in the graph are used to represent a change in the ranking, or commonality, of electrical generation sources in the U.S, while also maintaining the representation of percentage of use for each source . Third, I noticed how prevalent nonrenewable resources are in the production of electricity in the U.S. In 2017, coal, natural gas, and nuclear resources made up 82% of the electrical generation sources in the U.S. These sources are all nonrenewable, and thus generally less healthy for both the Earth and humans. I wonder what the future of electricity generation in the U.S. holds. Hopefully, a more renewable future is close. I also wonder what the causes and effects of two sources switching positions on the graph are. It would be interesting to know if major world events accompanied these shifts. The story this graph is telling is that coal, nuclear energy, and natural gas (most common) are the most prominent forms of energy in the U.S. Thus, much needs to be done for a cleaner nation. My headline would be, \"Does Change Really Mean Progress? The Problem With Nonrenewable Energy.\"",

Another important noticing trend is nuclear energy. During George Bush's era it was used and was very useful however, Obama had condemed nuclear power plants and shut down one of our only ways for us to rid ourselves of our waste. This is shown after Obama left the trend begane rising again. While under Obama fracking had boomed with incredible results. The extent of fracking is shown in natural gas graph. These oils and gases were found plentiful and allowed for more usage of these resources. Although the use of natural resouces are being used at a large rate, renewable resouces are not being used. The problem with using renewable resources is the production. When making solar pannels toxic metals are created running the risk of polluting the environment even more. Not only is pollution a huge problem with solar pannels but they are not as effective as thought. This could be seen with Germany's energy plan that resulted in even more polution. The graph itself shows as a whole how reliable we are on natural gas and soon will be on nuclear energy as well.",

As time passed by, different methods of electricity generation were put to use causing coal to slowly lose its place as the most dominate source of electricity generation. Although coal stays at the top throughout the whole timeline of the chart, going at this rate, I can infer that different methods are going to surpass coal in terms of country-wide usage. The thing that I most wonder is which of the methods will surpass coal usage first? I think that the reason that coal is slowly becoming less of a dominate source is because mankind are ,first of all, trying to find more effective methods of generating electricity that are more eco-friendly. Also, I believe that we are being forced to look into different sources of electricity generation due to our limited supply in coal.",

I notice that the primary source of our nation\u2019s energy emanated from coal from 2001-2016 (and surely long before that, as well). Next, I note how there is a brief drop-off in coal, and instead natural gas takes the lead from 2016-present as the United States\u2019 chief supply of electrical energy production. Adding, I observe that the exploitation of nuclear energy has slightly decreased over the years, but to no significant degree. Even smaller is the increase in the use of clean, renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric, wind, solar, and geothermal sources. This is likely because nonrenewable sources that are bad for the environment (i.e., coal, natural gas, nuclear power) are cheaper, and thus utilized more in spite of the grave environmental consequences. Likewise, energy sources that are eco-friendly are used far less because they are more expensive. However, their upfront costs even out in the end and actually save customers\u2019 money in addition to, more importantly, saving the planet.",

    "comment info": "When looking at this graph, I notice that coal has been a major source of electric generation since 2001 (51%). However, it seems that it is being used less recently, declining starting in 2015. Natural gases are increasing, meaning it is becoming a larger source. Nuclear energy became important, starting 2001 at 21%, but decreased (not much). Others, such as hydroelectric, solar, and wind power never really change in the graph, they remain very small. I wonder why coal is decreasing so much, and also why/how natural gases are becoming more useful for electric generation. I believe that the main idea of this graph to showing how much coal we actually use, the rapid increase in nuclear energy, and how many other sources we dismiss. If we decide to choose another option and make it more popular, it may be better for our environment.",

In complete honesty, this statistic confused me as I was not aware that coal was used so often. Personally, I believe that this might be due to the fact that I grew up in a very simplistic and modern era in terms of energy use. Many people are now switching to more natural sources, such as sunlight panels, in order to protect the environment. This might also explain why the use of coal has decreased from 51% to 30% in recent years. Additionally, natural gas has seen a massive increase from 17% in 2001 to 32% in 2017. An appropriate title for this graph would be \"Count Out Coal! We're #allnatural\" as this incorporates both the increased use of natural gases as well as the fact that today's society is so technology-based.",

I notice that the year of 2005-2006 was a turning point for natural gas at above 17%, and that in 2015-2016 it increased to a scale above 32%. I also note that all the percentages on the graph add up to 100%. I wonder if the 2016 New Source Performance Standards for Oil and Gas industries had any role in this shift away from coal and towards natural gas. In 2017, coal was at 30%, a significant decrease from 51% in 2001. I am curious about whether or not these standards- which streamlined production and implementation, reduced EPA and state requirements, and decreased burdens on producers- played a role in this change. I further wonder if the most recently proposed targeted improvements to these standards in 2018 will have such an effect.

Then from reading through the article I noticed that this graph is about the \"sources of electricity generation in the United States.\" I honestly wonder how electricity can be generated from all these different types of sources. This graph is showing the sources of electricity generation in the U.S. from 2001-2017. You can tell that coal is going down, while natural gas usage rate is rising. Other things that you can see is that solar energy is become more relevant now, so this whole graph could vary in future years.",

Natural gas is in second place with 21%, it is a very easy way of getting energy but does lot's of damage to the environment like the coal. Nuclear is at third place with 17% but isn't a surprise since nuclear plants need lots of space to run the use of nuclear power plants is diminishing because the population is increasing and the people need more space to live.

This happens all over the graph and indicates that percentages are always changing in what we use which can depend on the environment we live in and what is best for us as a society.",

The graph has helped me come a a deeper realization about how during the 21st century coal, natural gas, and nuclear energy have been the leading sources of electricity generation in the United States. I wonder what the top three leading sources of electricity in the United states were in previous decades.  I also wonder what the leading sources of electricity generation are in other countries.

Anyone looking at this graph could say that coal in leading the main source of generating electricity, but taking a glance it's clear that another source is climbing it's way up ladder. This is Natural gas. Many states are switching sources of electricity for example California main source is Natural gas. Although this is good because we are not burning as much fossil fuel another thing that we are doing is creating greenhouse gases. This is good and bad.

In 2000, it was the third most commonly used electrical generation source, and around 2015 it become the most common electrical generation source. Second, I noticed that, after close analysis, the jumps in the graph are used to represent a change in the ranking, or commonality, of electrical generation sources in the U.S, while also maintaining the representation of percentage of use for each source . Third, I noticed how prevalent nonrenewable resources are in the production of electricity in the U.S. In 2017, coal, natural gas, and nuclear resources made up 82% of the electrical generation sources in the U.S. These sources are all nonrenewable, and thus generally less healthy for both the Earth and humans. I wonder what the future of electricity generation in the U.S. holds. Hopefully, a more renewable future is close. I also wonder what the causes and effects of two sources switching positions on the graph are. It would be interesting to know if major world events accompanied these shifts. The story this graph is telling is that coal, nuclear energy, and natural gas (most common) are the most prominent forms of energy in the U.S. Thus, much needs to be done for a cleaner nation.

The percentages are the y-axis that clearly points out the top used source in the U.S and the x-axis in the graph is the years that is taken up by all the sources used during time in our country. I believe, that the main source coal, is the most used material we have today which can be useful for many things and can convert to many states in our country, as well as natural gas that is used in many ways such as for vehicles, trucks, or etc. These sources represent the generations that we use ever since the year 2001 and that is also helpful for our society today that we can also use it daily for a reason to create things in our country that is being produced each day.",

I' also noticed that Wind is the United States least used  source of electricity which is at a rate of around 2 percent. One thing that I've wondered about this graph is why natural gas and nuclear electricity crossover each other even though that nuclear energy is used more. What might be going on in this graph is that the United States made this graph so they could see how they can improve on making generable electricity without using coal so they are able to help the environment.",

In 2001 to 2015 coal was the main source of energy in America but was overcome by natural gas.

It helps to convey a story about how things are changing.  When the graphs overlap, that shows that they are at the same percentage of electricity generation at that time.",

I wonder why coal is the most used and why can't they use a better source. I wonder why not all sources are used equally if they are all able to be used. The graph tells us how much we use of these products and to be aware if we keep this on we may be living in a worst state later in the years.",

I wonder, what this graph represents and what it means. I wonder why this graph is being displayed on a New York Times Magazine. The story this graph is telling is how much of that product we have in the world.",
