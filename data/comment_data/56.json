This makes me wonder about the type of head protection each sport requires and the equipment\u2019s effectiveness. I also noticed that football generally has the most of every kind of injury. At the very least, the number of each injury is on the higher end of the range. This is surprising to me because football players are required to wear the most gear out of all the sports listed in this graph. Since football players wear helmets and padding I would expect them to receive fewer injuries than basketball, who have no protective gear. This data is very telling of how dangerous these five sports can be with the current rules of each game and the protective equipment required. These two things should be reassessed two bring down the number of injuries in the future. For each sport, protective gear should be added or improved in the places where boys received a large number of injuries, such as the ankle for basketball and the shoulder for hockey.

Therefore, choosing to focus their attention on head injuries shows the desperate cry for awareness to be spread about how serious these injuries can be. I also noticed that the more physical contact sports tend to have to most injury, like football, with players hitting each other all the time to prevent the other team to make a point. While in basketball there\u2019s little to no contact and the players seem to be choosing a less dangerous sport. I noticed that wrestling, lacrosse, and soccer all had similar injuries, which is interesting because wrestling is a very intense sport where members are the team are actively fighting other people, while lacrosse and soccer are both field sports. What I wonder is if the numbers inside the bubbles are how many times members of the teams were injured and if how many members were there would affect the results of the graph.

Even flag football players should wear high-quality shoulder pads for protection.

Noticed that there is a wide variety of injuries occured throughout the body throughout the many different kinds of sports. Noticed that the head typically receives the most amount of injuries throughout the sports. \nThe 3 Things that I wondered about is that why Football players receives the most amount of injuries despiste having more protective gears than what others of the different sports usually have.

But why so many head injuries, and why are there any in the first place? The head is easily the worst place to be damaged, as it can lead to concussions and other issues in the future. I think the coaches need to realize that the boys on the team are still kids, and need to play in safer conditions with more protective gear. \nI also wonder why football was the most dangerous sport when you would expect hockey and wrestling to be the same, or even worse. A reason for this may be that football is just too aggressive, and I think they should cut back on the amount of rough contact they make with each other.",

    "comment info": "The infographic illustrates the variation in the injuries students sustain across different sports. The author used different sized circles overlayed on top of specific body areas to highlight the number of specific injuries for a particular sport in a sample of 10,000 students. We can conclude from the infographic that football is associated with more frequent injuries, especially head, hand, knee, and angle injuries. These results are not surprising \u2013 football is contact-heavy, and involves collission of heads, pushing, and quick changes of directions, all which correspond to higher rates of injuries. While the results make sense, I am extremely curious on how the 10,000 samples were collected. The region and district in which a student plays is extremely important because different areas have different regulations on contact and perhaps normalize certain forms of contact that other regions do not. Furthermore, blocking between experienced athletes and new athletes would be effective in order to see if there are any differences between the two groups, as new athletes are likely less fit and have higher risks of becoming injured. Regardless, the infographic and study conducted are important in understanding the relationship between high school sports and injuries \u2013 it can be used in helping guide parents in what sports their child should play, and in regulating policies of specific sports. I would title it \"When Recreation Becomes Injurious.\"",

It makes you wonder if there could be more precautionary measures to prevent head injuries in all sports. I don't play games. But when I was younger, I played soccer but was terrified of the ball hitting me in the face and breaking my glasses. This seems silly now, but looking and the risk of injury in your head still being high in a sport where your not tackling people seems crazy.\n\tAlso, I wonder why they didn't do this using girl's sports. I think it would have been interesting to see the difference in injury per game as a side to side comparison. I think this would have shown the difference in the roughness you usually see in boys playing sports. I know a lot of injuries when a boy plays a game than if a girl plays the same competition.",

Injuries in many different contact sports are really becoming a rising issue in our country. I also noticed how many head injuries are occurring in mainly football and hockey! It is absurd how these injuries occur. \n\n              I personally play a non-contact sport (swimming) and I have never been exposed to the effects that contact and forcefully occurring injuries can have on our human bodies. I cannot imagine how it would feel to stop a sport all because of too many head injuries of too much contact with your own shoulder. This photo really gave me insight of how we need to be cautious about our bodies (we only get one) and that it is always important to stay safe.",

Lastly, I notice that the number of ankle injuries is somewhat low except for basketball which has 13 injuries per 10,000 competition plays. I wonder what factors cause the injuries to be at this number. I also wonder if there should be more protection for each of these players so that more injuries can be prevented.

It is widely known that sports can cause a variety of injuries in a single season. A few years ago I remember signing a form before trying out for a school athletic team and I can remember reading it over and it warned of serious injury, concussions, and possible death. It is quite remarkable what injuries can be promoted by a single sport. As much as I wasn't surprised on seeing football soar at the top of the list I was surprised to see that soccer had the least injuries. I have had many friends that had gone through concussions, knee problems, and broken feet from soccer and if so many have had problems from soccer and it has the least amount of injuries, I can imagine about the other sports. Most teens who experience an injury don't think about the long term impact but only focus on the process of healing and recovery so they can jump right back into the sport I wonder about the long term effects of that. \nHeadline: Sports aren\u2019t just touchdown and baskets",

I know this because I had a stress fracture for almost a year and many of my teammates, both male and female, struggle with the frustration and pain of injuries as well. From my experience, I wonder about the psychological effect on students from being sidelined during their injury and how it varies by sport. I also wonder how the injuries within sports occur. In sports such as football and hockey that are known for high physical impact, it is heavily implied that injuries are caused by the impact. In other sports such as soccer or basketball where there is less contact, I begin to question if the injuries are from overuse (which is what my personal injury was from) or from the contact within the sport. By questioning this, I began to notice how common injuries are for athletes, despite the use of protection such as helmets, shin guards, etc. If injuries are both physically and psychologically taxing for students, who are still adolescents, we should be making sure we are taking all preventative measures possible to ensure that minimal student injuries occur.",

Growing up hearing stories from my mother about how her brothers used to end up in violent fights after an assumed foul while playing hockey that usually resulted in a staple to head, it was somewhat jarring to see the difference between football and hockey. Perhaps this is the results of new rules being placed in recent years?\n\nSeeing the vast amount of trauma within the ankle as the result of playing football really made me wonder how sports that majorly focus on using the feet like soccer don't have as many injuries.

This is what I noticed while observing a graph about how often high school sports players are injured while playing a sport. As a high school lacrosse player, I am appalled by the number of total injuries that occurred. During just 10,000 competition plays, 37 marked injuries took place. I was shocked that there were this many. Even though I know that the sport is very contact-focused, I did not expect a number that high. This number, while it is shocking, is only fourth-highest among popular sports, and it pales in comparison to the number that occur in football. Football causes 34 head injuries every 10,000 plays. That is almost the total number of all that occurred during lacrosse, and that number is only referring to head injuries. In addition, this number only encompasses competition plays, when practice time is much more common than competition and provides even more opportunities for injury. These games need to be safer.\n    With this in mind, I wonder what the effect of safer game rules and better equipment would be on the amount of injuries in these sports. If there were better padding in sports with too many injuries, such as football, perhaps there would be less bodily harm. Better helmets could lower the amount of head injuries, and perhaps new rules could make the game less violent in order to make high school sports safer for the youth.",

I notice that the head is more frequently injured than other body parts in any graph. This may be a problem due to the head being the most important part of the body. If things get too rough, the player might have a speech impediment for the rest of his or her life. I know officials are doing their best to help prevent this, so I won\u2019t say anything about needing to do better in that. I also noticed that Football has the most injuries. It has bigger circles than other sports. This is reasonable since this sport is a contact sport. But wrestling is also a contact sport. \n\nI wonder why wrestling doesn\u2019t have as many injuries as football? As a wrestler, I can conclude that the referees are very spectacle of the situation. They will call out if something is too dangerous. I wonder if this is the reason why they don\u2019t have as many injuries.",

As this does make sense because it is arguably the most contact sport out of the list, it still is ridiculous how many injuries there are. A common similarity I see between all of the sports is that all of them have head injuries. I've had numerous friends have to miss school on many occasions just due to injuries from sports. I'm on the cross country team at Hoggard and have had no injuries because of how they take precautions and try their best for no one to be injured.\n\nI wonder what we could do to make all of these sports safer without taking away the fun aspects of it. Head injuries alone should be our number one concern. You could be a soccer player for high school, make it into college, and then one injury could leave you never being able to play again. With this being said, I would try to come up with ideas to make these sports safer to play while still being able to have a good time.",

I definitely don't play football but I myself have had a head injury once before and just that one was enough for me to feel dizzy and have a headache if I read for too long. \nI wonder if there has been any progress in trying to prevent even more head injuries from happening.

Is it because of the certain sport and warm ups the coaches have their players doing. As someone who doesn't particularly enjoy sports or partake in them, I often question that when players get injuries are they ever actually \"healed\"? Do doctors and coaches say their player is better to get them back to work so they aren't down a player?\n  \n   I wonder why head injuries are often \"treated\"  and then the player is required to come back. Why don't they get more rest time? Why are sports so important anyway? Kids put they're all their time into them hoping to get a scholarship for college but if you get injured(like a head injury) then your playing days are over. I feel that coaches sometimes put too much pressure on their players to keep going and sometimes the players put too much pressure on themselves. I understand people having their own loves for activities they enjoy just like I do but why not spend more time having fun doing those activities than worrying about that next scholarship or if you're going to get injured or impressing someone else? Why not just do it for you?",

This makes sense to me because football players endure the most physical contact. I am surprised to see that football sustains more injuries in the knee, leg and ankle than soccer. From my one season of organized soccer, I can say it is not very physical, but it is easy to get kicked and stepped on. That being said, I would've thought there would've been more leg and ankle injuries for soccer players. Another thing I wonder as an athlete is the long term effect of injury. It is more common for long time football players to suffer from problems such as brain damage. This graph definitely shows that football deals with the most head injuries so this makes me think about long term issues.",

As a athlete myself I know that we don't all like to admit when we get injured because we don't want to be taken out of the play. From personal experience I received a concussion in the middle of a soccer game and after catching my breath I waned to get right back into it but my coach sat me out for the rest of the game. And then the next day we had another game so I showed up and was ready to play, eventually I did start to experience some side effect of a concussion so I did have to visit a doctor.

Football is most commonly known for its head injuries, the debates on how to make it safer are plentiful. Constant arguing over whether or not to change the rules, the equipment, or even the entire sport to make it safer for kids. Something that needs to be pointed out is that there is risk associated with everything sport you play, it just depends on how comfortable you are with taking those risks. After looking at this graph, I wonder what keeps these boys interested in these sports if there is such a high risk of injury. I guess it could be their high adrenaline levels, their aggressive nature as stated before, or just their hunger to the best. But where is the line between risk and reward? All Injuries add up over time and take a large toll on your body? As an athlete, I\u2019m not against playing sports and getting hurt, it builds character and helps us develop into stronger people, but it\u2019s the ones who push themselves past their threshold that I'm worried about.

The worst part is the fact that the head injuries are so high. Football players wear a good amount of protection yet they still rank the highest for injuries. This leads me to ask the question, how protected are they actually. One of my friends from middle school had suffered about three concussions from his time while playing football. He was a quarterback with a lot of potential, but was taken off the team by his mother out of fear, and rightfully so. Before this school year started my friend was debating weather to play football or wrestling. I was relieved to hear he would be joining the wrestling team. I wondered why I was so relieved by what he told me. Then I came to the conclusion that you hear more horror stories about football and all the awful articles about brain injuries and their consequences.

My eyes were immediately drawn to the players heads since each of those sports besides basketball has the most damaged in that area. That all made sense to me since those are very competitive sports but what didn't make sense to me was how hockey and wrestling have the same trunk damage as soccer, lacrosse and basketball. I've seen all these sports played on TV or in person and noticed that hockey and wrestling have more ramming into each other than the other sports that would get a penalty for doing so. Personally I played soccer and was never really hurt in the trunk area but I have friends that wrestle that have been hurt there. There should be more protection and awareness to the kids or adults that could be injured by these sports since some of the damage could have a huge impact on their lives.",

These are serious injuries to the head, ankle, knee, etc. that prevent people from competing in the thing they love to do most. I wonder how these injuries impact their life and future career. The graph also shows that different sports have different injuries regarding the human body, like how basketball tends to have many more ankle injuries than hockey while hockey players suffer many more shoulder injuries than basketball players. As an athlete, I know how painful it is not only to have the injury, but to have to suffer with the fact that I cannot compete in the thing I love doing most. So while every athlete is bound to get an injury playing whatever sport they love, it is important to have the safest equipment possible to insure that every child and adult can compete at the highest level possible.",

I understand people have dedication and love for whatever sport they may play, but why would you play to the extent of potentially hurting yourself or others?\nDo the players ever fathom weather they will get hurt or do they just play until it\u2019s too late to rethink their decisions? I\u2019m not one to understand the wanting to be apart of a sport and play to my hearts\u2019 desire, but I do understand the love of doing something you're passionate about. My passion for music drives me to practice beyond hours of exhaustion, and to never give up on a piece of music, no matter how hard it is. \n  I know the line of hobbies is extremely different, but when I look at this graph a part of me does understand. Even though the game is difficult and may end up suffering from whatever injury, the game itself, and the experience and joy it brings from being apart of it is something you feel you can\u2019t be without. But I wonder, if the injury itself could have been avoided, would the player make the same choice, for the sake of the game?",

Another piece of information also surprised me is that basketball has more ankle injuries than most of the sports listed such as soccer and hockey where I would think ankle injuries would be much more prominent. Some things are to be expected, such as soccer having less injuries than football and hockey.\n       What has my interest piqued, is that over the years I know that many people have been trying to improve and have focused on making head injuries safer for football. I think I\u2019m just surprised that such a big sport in America would have so much more injuries statistically even with how much attention it has gotten. Maybe it already has improved, we would need an earlier chart to tell. If so, I hope the numbers continue to decline.

When I watch friends of mine that play these sports come away with major or minor injuries it makes me wonder how and when things will change so the players feel more protected and can play aggressively but safe.
