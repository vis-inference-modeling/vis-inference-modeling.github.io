I truly wonder how long it will take for the government to regulated A.I. It appears that A.I. is growing incredibly fast rate. It is growing at such a fast rate that will make it hard for the government to catch up. However, A.I. is internet related so I wonder if that will help the government's response time as clearly it took the government less time to regulate internet content than some other things like air conditioning, refigeration, and electricity. Despite the fact that it is one of the lower times displayed on the graph, 10 years is a very long time. With the rate that A.I. is moving the government truly needs to attempt something new to handle this task. I hope it will not take as long as it did for them to regulate internet content but it is something different than every seen before so I do not know how to predict how long it will take. \nThis relates to my community and I as I have noticed A.I. becoming more and more relevant in my day to day life.

    "comment info": "This graph shows the time between an invention and its first federal regulation. Electric air conditioning took the longest to have federal regulation. This is because in the early 1900's there were presidents (Harding, Coolidge, Hoover) who believed that \"business should be business\". Before those presidents, we fought in WW1. After those presidents, is when the Great Depression hit and after that the US got involved in WW2. After WW2 ended, we entered the Vietnam War. I can conclude that all of this commotion in the US is why it took so long for a regulation on electric air conditioning. The government probably had more pressing issues going on. Nuclear energy took the least years to regulate. I speculate this is because there was an issue quickly brought to the attention of the government about the improper use of nuclear energy. When they recognized this, they were able to place regulations to resolve this problem. Internet content and television most likely got regulated quickly because of how popular they became and the things people published for the whole world to see. This definitely grabbed Congress' attention. I wonder why airplanes and the radio took the same amount of time to regulate. I think airplane regulation and safety would be a more pressing topic than radio content. This relates to me because we are learning about how the government can put different regulations on the internet, news, TV, etc, and not violate any fundamental rights. \n\"Raging Regulations\"",

Since there doesn't seem to be any consistent trends between innovation type and regulation, the relationship between the two will most likely differ from each variable.\n\nWhy did it take so long for inventions like railroads, air-conditioning, cars, and refrigerators to get regulated if they heavily impact our everyday life?\n\nThis relates to my community, despite the fact that the human race survived without these inventions, they are still present and heavily relied on.

There were definitely many political events happening for the first half of the century.\n\nYou also mentioned regulating cars. Your wondering got me wondering so I did a little research.

There should be a lot of aspects that affect this time frame and make you wonder how many and why they are utilized. \n\nEven though they were not always present, many of these inventions are commonplace items that we see today. We cannot predict how long it will take for these new technologies to be controlled, as there are undoubtedly many more to come. One such example is artificial intelligence (AI), which is becoming more and more popular.\n\nWhen will the government take a stand?",

There are so many variables that could affect the time between invention and regulation.  Arianna Ramos  from your school divided the inventions between those used in war and not.  What are other sets of subcategories that could be used to divide the inventions and see if there is an association between subcategories and time to regulation?\n\nI\u2019d want to know how the date for \u201cinvention or patenting\u201d was determined.  Also, was the date of regulation, the first regulation or more regulation?  And, what was going on with electric air-conditioning?  Seems that invention would not take so long or maybe it was considered unnecessary to regulate.  \n\nThere is a research paper in this graph!",

It ranges from 4 (nuclear energy) to 90 years (electric air-conditioning). However, the most modern inventions including television, nuclear energy, and internet content, have been more swiftly regulated. I also notice that electric air-conditioning and electric refrigeration were federally regulated at around the same time in the 80s/90s.\n\nI wonder why electric air conditioning and electric refrigeration were regulated at the same time? Perhaps environmental impact was taken into consideration, so a general piece of legislation was passed. I also wonder why it has taken government so long to regulate certain inventions?\n\nThis affects me and my community because the government can continue to restrict people's access to new inventions. However, regulations may be beneficial if they reduce environmental impact.\n\n\"The Inventor's Plight: Federal Regulation\"\n\nThis graph depicts the differing time between invention and major federal regulation.

Some essential and revolutionary technologies took over 60 years, like railroads, electric refrigerators, and electric air-conditioning, before their first major federal regulation. Other areas such as television and nuclear energy, only existed for a few years before the government passed a major federal regulation. I wonder why it took 70 years for the automobile market to receive its first major regulation as opposed to television only existing for 5 years before receiving its first major regulation. I also wonder as time goes on and inventions are born every day, especially with innovative companies led by futuristic ideals in the interest of AI, will major regulations start increasing? How will this impact modern inventions? Regulations are necessary in protecting society but considering the lack of clarity surrounding AI, which will inevitably take over the world, will the government be driven by fear to create regulations rather than interest in the product produced? In my community, the majority of people use most of the inventions listed above daily. Technology is what supports our life so the government must protect that. Yet again, will the everyday man have to pay the price (in the sense of egregious federal regulations) as the United States begins to step into the next leading market? \n\n\u201cPatent, Sell\u2026REGULATION!

For instance, this includes the physical distance airplanes can travel with a low 20 years time period for regulations to be instituted. Also, the spread of information over far distances with the radio, internet content and television was restricted at or below 20 years after its release. This in general makes me wonder if the government is concerned about national security or a fear of impacting the national reputation so regulations were emplaced faster? In comparison, I noticed that the more restrictive forms of transportation took much longer for the establishment of federal regulations. For example, forms of transportation that are mainly restricted to land in the United States such as railroads and automobiles took up to 5 more decades for regulations to be imposed. I also observed how the technology boom in the 1900s produced the delayed response of Congress to regulate technologies in the 21st century.

Inventions such as automobiles took 70 years, electric air conditioning took 90 years, and the electric refrigerator took 70 years.

What effects may occur if these inventions are not regulated? If any, how often can malfunctions occur?\n3. This relates to my community and me, as these inventions are significant to our everyday lives. Even though these A.I. regulations should have been performed sooner, our communities could be negatively impacted if the risk, safety, and security of these inventions are not managed.\n4.

And from what year have these types of inventions been approved. For example, telephones have been out before the 1900s  but lasted 30 years to be accepted and television has been from the 1940s but lasted 5 years to be accepted. I wonder why the government lasted that long to get this type of patented technology and why they decided to shorten the time in recent years. Also, one of the things that I wonder is how these periods have been affected by the delay of the products.

Either, the government is very aware of what is happening and is regulating technologies before they become a problem, or they are being too hasty in their decision to regulate new technologies.\n\nThis makes me wonder what the breaking point between the government and new tech is in terms of regulating it. Is it also more awareness of the fact that new tech is important? This is not to say that railroads and cars aren't important-- it took many decades for regulations to be achieved-- but why is it that new tech is being regulated quicker? \n\nThis relates to my community as we are the ones that deal with the new technology as it comes out. New tech is being created as we speak, so what is the line that needs to be crossed for regulations to occur?

Does the party and viewpoints of the President have any effect on when these regulations happen? I would suppose so, as republicans are typically known as supporters of freer market, while democrats are supposedly known for their dislike of the wealthiest 1% or something like that, and they also purportedly favor more regulations on markets.\n\nWell, every law impacts a community where it is legislated so this is certainly no different. The enforcement of technologies likely makes certain transactions lengthier, as more process need to be gone through, but at the same time (I think rightly trusting that the government still has some good goals) I would suppose these regulations would provide safety and would ensure that transactions are fair.

Starting in the 1950s, the federal government became much more concerned with these restrictions (probably because of the effects of tech in World War 2). This shift led them to not only restrict the new inventions, but older innovations that had been in place for upwards of twenty years. \n \n2-     \nWas the culture of the early days of America more inviting to innovators? \n\nHow do government restrictions tie into the lack of STEM focus in schools? \n\nIs government control inhibiting innovation? Is that their duty, or is that infringing on citizens' rights? \n\t\n3- People are always worried about infringement of personal rights. Gun rights. Health care. Right to vote in a free election. Reading rights and religion. These are the issues of our time, and they impact everyone. However, we don\u2019t talk much about our inherent right to innovate.

I\u2019m not saying that our \u201cpushing\u201d has always been in the right direction- by no means. But what happened to the drive of American invention?

For example, railroads, electric refrigerators, and automobiles have some of the longest times ranging from 60-90 years. Both automobiles and railroads are massive heavy pieces of machinery that can easily kill many people. One of the major elements of life is food, and if it goes bad in a faulty electric refrigerator, then it can cause significant health problems.\n2.What I wonder is why nuclear energy takes an average of 4 years to reach federal regulation, when it can easily become a threat to humans through an explosion. \n3. This has major impacts on my community, as this not only reflects the struggle for entrepreneurs in America, but also the struggle for consumers. As federal regulation continues to take longer and longer for certain items, those in the respective industries may struggle to get their product to market ending in them making less or no money because of the wait. On the other hand, American consumers may become frustrated with the continuous wait to get the product they have been waiting for. In addition, those that are trying to invent a new product not on the graph and get federal approval may have to wait longer because of the backlog caused by the already existing items mentioned on the graph. \n4.

    "comment info": "I've noticed that the regulation of technology depends less on the time period, and more on prioritization. An example of this is telephones taking about 30 years to get regulated and electric AC taking 90 years to regulate, even though telephones began regulation earlier. The time period does play a part though, since the three most recent technologies have taken much less time to regulate than previous ones. \n\nI'm wondering whether the popularity of certain technologies contributes to the speed of its regulation more than its actual benefits to society. For example, radio took 20 years to regulate while automobiles, which started at a similar time, took 70 years. \n\nRegulations impact communities greatly since it determines accessibility of technology. Revolutionary technology, such as internet content and nuclear energy, stand out as some of the technologies that take up the least time to regulate. \n\n \"Regulation Prioritizations\"",

The time between invention and the first major federal regulations have ranged from 4-10 years in this timeframe. \n\n\n2. What do you wonder?\n\n\nI wonder what caused the American government to regulate inventions faster during the past few decades. Is it because the government has become larger and more involved in the American economy? Does newer technology provide the government with more data and information to support the regulation of new inventions? Has the government learned from past mistakes and begun to regulate inventions faster as a result? Is the invention of newer technologies more dangerous than past inventions? \n\n\n3.

The time that it takes to pass regulation around new technology seems to be getting shorter or at least, for more pressing technologies it is short. For example, the time it took for federal regulations of nuclear energy and the internet is significantly shorter than most of the other data. They sit at 4 and 10 years respectively, while most of the rest sit above 30 years or so.\n2. I wonder if the threat of technology plays a major influence on the speed of federal legislation. For example, nuclear energy was quickly regulated which has clear negative ramifications should something go wrong, but electric air conditioning, took significantly longer. I also wonder in that regard, if the time it takes also depends on the speed of illness, in other words, how long it takes before the effects of the unregulated technology begin to harm society.\n3. This has a great impact on me and my community. New technologies are emerging every day, and it is the government\u2019s job to ensure that the interest of everyday citizens is protected.

However, electric refrigeration, despite being not much earlier than television, took 75 years longer. Additionally, I observed that many inventions took an exceptionally long time to be patented, ranging from roughly 30 to 70 years, which is much longer than I would have expected.\n\n\n2. What do you wonder?\n\n\nI wonder why some inventions took significantly longer to be patented compared to others that were patented relatively quickly. I'm curious to know if the time required for patent approval depended on the type of invention or if the era in which the inventions were developed influenced the duration of the patenting process.\n\n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\n\n\n\n\nThe increased pace of technological advancements is very important to me and my community, as these inventions significantly impact our daily lives. The fast evolution of technology is important, as it has provided students with unprecedented opportunities for learning in school. If technological innovation had taken as long as some other inventions, such as 50 years, our education system would not be functioning as effectively as it does today.",

Looking at the graph, the invention of television, nuclear energy and internet content took less than 10 years until the first major federal regulation occurred. This demonstrates that past the year of approximately 1930, the federal regulation has come quickly to stop any funny business.\n2. I wonder why electric air conditioning took the longest to receive its first major federal regulation. I think of air conditioning as something that is admitted into our air frequently. It honestly shocks me that the first major regulation wasn\u2019t until after 90 years. \n3.This impacts my community because the federal regulation team has my future in their hands.

Nuclear energy seems to be more \"important\" because it can be impactful to the human race, meaning they will work faster and harder to regulate it. Or is it due to the complexity of the topic? Electric air conditioning seems like it could be a complex thing to regulate, while televisions were easier because they are much less complex, but also a priority at the time because of how common they were.\n\nI think this relates to me and my community because this pattern can also be applied to our lives now. Things the government is trying to regulate may take a long time due to complexity or be really fast due to high usage of it. It might also show where the government's priorities are at.\n\nHow long will AI take to be regulated?",

Did the government regulate nuclear energy fast because they needed the power or because of the danger of it? \n3.

We wonder what other inventions haven't been listed and whether you would see a clearer pattern if there were more inventions listed. We wonder about recently invented inventions that haven't been regulated yet. We wonder if looking at more inventions would allow us to see a correlation between how dangerous the invention is and how quickly it gets regulated. However, how dangerous something is is hard to measure because with time, older things seem less dangerous but new things seem more dangerous.

I wonder if at the time nuclear energy wasn't thought to be as dangerous and that they were happy to have a new energy source and didn't think of the consequences. This relates to my community because if there is a chance that scientists find a new energy source, there is a chance that they won't find all the dangers of using it, which will put people at risk. A catchy headline would be \"Do you know what was approved the fastest?\"",
