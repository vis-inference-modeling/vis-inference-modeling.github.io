Additionally, the UK experienced the biggest decline in trade volume. There wasn't as much of a volume disparity in trade with Germany, South Korea, and Japan. Additionally, I saw that trade with the yellow-hued nations has declined since the invasion. Furthermore, it appears that only nations in the eastern hemisphere, those closest to Russia, are still trading, and doing so more frequently. The number of NATO members has considerably dropped.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\n\nI'm curious as to why the graph's arrows are various sizes. Is it the volume of trade they have with the nation or its significance? The reasons behind the various results also intrigued me. After the invasion, it seems logical why several nations reduced their trade with Russia.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\n\nGiven that we reside in the United States, this immediately affects my community and me. Everything began to gradually rise, including the price of gas. Gas-dependent items now have higher costs to cover, which forces them to raise their pricing.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?

The only data present that might be substituted for it is for 'Moscow', and even when analyzing that, a number of errors come up. Even then, when comparing increases and decreases in trade, the numbers on the graph do not match those of the source. Vietnam's trade-value with Moscow, by far, increased the most, and yet it isn't represented here. The total trade volume with Turkey was higher than that of China, and yet China's arrow and percentage are both larger than Turkey's.

It also appears that China was Russia\u2019s largest trading partner, but they had a much larger increase in trade with India. The largest decrease in trade by percentage was with the United Kingdom. The first thing that I wondered was why certain countries were increasing their trade with Russia, was it because of a new opportunity given the decrease with many other countries? Were these countries that increased their trade with Russia making up for the decreases or was it completely unrelated? In American (and generally Western) media, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is perceived as evil and completely unwarranted. The graph, showing decreases in trade with Western countries such as the UK, the US, and even their allies in South Korea, reflects the idea that the media portrays Russia\u2019s actions as malevolent. On the opposite side of the spectrum, countries that often align with Russia like China, India, and other non-Western countries are shown to have increases in trade, leading me to the conclusion that perhaps it is because of how the invasion is viewed in their country.  I wonder what types of trade decreased for each country, like commodities, oil, etc. I also wonder if there were any significant countries that were left out of this visual, and how perspectives might change if they were included.",

We also view, the percentage change in trade since the invasion as compared to the data for 2017 \u2013 2021. China seemingly has the widest arrow, while Sweden has the thinnest one. Although China has the widest arrow it does not have the highest increase. India does (+310%).\n\nI wonder why exactly most of the countries presented have increased their trade with Russia despite the situation with Ukraine? Is it because they lack supplies or resources which Russia provides? Do they believe their moral beliefs of standing on the Ukraine situation should be set aside from needed resources?\n\nI believe this is of significance to my community because most resources are obtained via trade. I believe in the U.S. used to obtain oil or petroleum from Russia, but then put that to a stop after the events in Ukraine.

I also observed that following the invasion, trade between Russia and India rose but trade between Russia and the UK fell. After the invasion, trade volumes increased in a significant number of Asian and European nations, but they dropped in a large number of other nations. I also observed that the European nations represented in the graph were more likely to have declined than expanded their trade with Russia.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI'm curious as to why trade between the majority of the nations has increased so significantly. I wonder if the nations that remained just took up the trade of those that left. Where they for social or economic reasons? Before Russia invaded Ukraine, how did trade between the nations on the graph look? Are the products imported and exported by each nation the same?\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis is relevant to my town because we have seen how the invasion has affected our economy. For instance, after declining, gas prices increased. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, American trade with Russia has fallen by 35%. Since we aren't getting the essential imports from Russia, our economy is undoubtedly suffering.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?

Those of who's trade volume have decreased are the ones who cut ties off with Russia in support of Ukraine, which can be shown by looking at the orange arrows. For instance, take a look at the United States, the economy declined by 35%. Same as the UK, which declined by 79%, Sweden declined by 76%, Germany declined by 3%, and South Korea declined by 17%. On the other hand, countries like China and Turkey, their trade volume increased by 64% and 198%. India's economy has also increased 310%. It appears that those who have not cut ties with Russia are those countries most close to the region of where Russia is located, which could explain why their economy is benefitting from Russia. \n2. I wonder if those who have cut ties with Russia were also trading with those countries who stayed trading with Russia?  Did they stay in connection with those countries or cut ties with them as well?\n3. This relates to me and my community because with the United States ending trade with Russia, it strips away a bit of the money that is being used towards the invasion to hurt Ukraine and their people.

I also noticed that the highest countries in trade increase were India and Turkey, and the lowest were United Kingdom or Sweden. I can see that this is the comparison between trade after the invasion and trade in the years before from around 2017-2021. \nI wonder why India has the highest increase in trade volume and if it has anything to do with the location of Russia in comparison to India or there are different factors.\nI live in the United States and therefore can see that certain items typically originating from Russia may be in higher demand and lower stock.\nRussia and Ukraine's conflict: How has it affected trade?",

What stands out is that while some of these countries have seen their trade decrease, the majority of trade has increased. The broadest arrow, China, shows a high monthly trade rate. It is also interesting that countries like India and Turkey have increased their trade rates so much after the war. I wonder what the motivations are for the different results. It makes a lot of sense why different countries decreased their trade with Russia after the invasion. But why did so many countries significantly increase their trade? Could it be because they are okay with the situation? This matters to me and my community because it is important to look at the benefits of countries that are under attack and try to help them in any way we can.

I notice how, out of the countries represented, there are more nations that increased their trade volumed rather than decreased it. The nation that stands out the most to me is China, as its trade with Russia has improved by 64% since the invasion. I wonder why nations decided to either increase or decrease their volume with Russia. Where they for social or economic reasons? This relates to me and my community because as a United States citizen, I am affected by the nation's economy which is affected by trade with Russia.

The highest increase of trade is 310% for India, where the highest decrease is the United Kingdom with 79%. More countries had an increase in trade, with eight countries increasing and five countries having a decrease in trade. The total percentage of increase is 861% which is 651 more than the total decrease which is 210%. \nI wonder why there was such a bigger increase in trade after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. I wonder if the change in trade was Russia's decision or the other countries decisions to cut down trade. \nThis relates to me and my community because living in the United States, with a decrease in trade, shows that we stand with Ukraine. I know people who have been badly affected by Russia's invasion so increasing trade would be wrong in supporting Russia in that way. \nCatchy Headline:\n\"Russia After Invasion: Cutting Down or Increasing Trade?\"",

Each arrow represents whether Russia\u2019s trading increased or decreased with a certain country after invading Ukraine. While purple represents an increase, orange represents a decrease. And the width of the arrows signifies how much trading is happening with a country. Based on this, it can be concluded that China is the country that Russia trades the most while it trades the least with Sweden.\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why trading increased with certain countries after invading Ukraine since I don\u2019t see how invading another country would result in an increase of trading. Is it a result of those countries not being on good terms with Ukraine or is it something else? I also wonder why Russia trades the most with China over any other country shown, as well as why there was such a large increase in trade volume with India compared to every other country.\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to my community and I because the graph shows how much Russia trades with the U.S in comparison with other countries.

Trade consists of imports plus exports.  How has this mix of exports and imports changed for a specific country?  Also, prices have changed.  The increase may be due to an increase in demand (amount of a product) or it may be due to increase in the price.  Think about whether the increase in trade is due to an increase in imports and/or exports and, for each, whether it is dues to a change in amount and/or price.  Of course, this will be different for every country.  \n\nThen, please return to this site when, by Friday, we will reveal the free link to the article that includes this graph plus several other graphs.

In the figure, I noticed that while countries like the United Kingdom and Sweden traded with Russia a lot less, other countries such as China, Turkey, India, and Brazil have increased their trades with Russia. It appears as if countries have increased trade in general with Russia, with few reducing their trades with Russia to a significant amount.  \n\n2. Something I wonder from the figure are whether the increased trades are imports or exports, along with what the resources countries traded with Russia.  \n\n3. This figure relates to me and my community as the U.S., a country which planned on limiting trades with Russia, may soon encounter in a situation that increases trade with Russia, due to other countries not following through. As mentioned in the article how Russia has important sources to oil and gas, the U.S. may feel more inclined to increase trades with Russia in order to deal with gas prices and the use of reserves.  \n\n4. In the figure, it depicts the trade volume of countries with Russia which depicts many countries increasing their trade with Russia.

The graph employs arrows to depict trade inside nations such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Sweden, Brazil, and others, as well as how much it has reduced or risen. It is also worth noting that five of the thirteen nations listed in the graph lowered their trade with Russia by an average of 42%: the United Kingdom, Sweden, the United States, South Korea, and Germany, all of which are members of NATO. \n2) I'm perplexed as to why, given its stance on the Ukrainian invasion, China has the largest monthly trade value with Russia post-invasion. I'm particularly curious about what India trades with Russia and why its volume has increased the greatest after the invasion. Has the sale of firearms grown since the invasions? \n3) This has repercussions for me and my community since the cost of some things have skyrocketed, especially our oil prices, as a result of the nation's restricted oil resources following the cessation of all commerce with Russia. Inflation has been a major concern for many families who are struggling to make ends meet.

You write: \u201cAs a whole, economic sanctions aren't affected since while many countries made a dramatic increase in trade with Russia since the invasion, many countries made a dramatic decrease in trade\u2026 As a whole, economic sanctions aren't affected since while many countries made a dramatic increase in trade with Russia since the invasion, many countries made a dramatic decrease in trade.\u201d\n\nHere is how you could determine if your last statement is true.  \n\nYou have the trade post-invasion.  You could add these numbers to get the total volume from these countries (not all countries) to determine the post-invasion trade.  You know the change in volume since the invasion by country, so you could calculate the trade before the invasion (trade post-invasion / percentage change) for each country.  Then, you could sum these numbers to get the volume of trade before the invasion for these countries.  \n\nNow, have sanctions (for these countries) affected Russia?  By how much?",

Although the United States decreased trade with Russia to a lesser extent than Sweden or the United Kingdom, it has a wider arrow than Sweden or the UK. If the width of the arrow is meant to display the gravity of the change in trade, then this graph is misleading. The most egregious example of this is China's arrow, which shows an increase of 64%. It is, by far, the widest arrow on this map, and yet, somehow, Spain's arrow (with an increase of 57%) and Belgium's arrow (with an increase of 81%) are both much thinner than China's. Immediately, this makes me wonder why the data is being presented in such a misleading manner. Is China's percent increase in trade volume (of 64 percent!) meant to be more important than India's increase of 310%, or Turkey's 198%? Is Germany's percent decrease in trade volume (of ONLY 3 percent!) meant to be more important than the United State's decrease of 35%, or Sweden's decrease of 76%? What are they trying to pull?\nWith these statements in mind, I begin to wonder about what exact relevance this has to me and my community. For some reason, the Observatory of Economic Complexity wants me to understand from this figure that China and Russia are trading more with each other since 2017-2021. Why, as an American, would I be concerned with this? America has committed an unspeakable number of atrocities worldwide for hundreds of years, and yet their trade doesn't change.",

I wonder why China trade value with Russia has increased so much after the first invasion. Moreover, do large arrows signify an underlying show of support or perhaps they see a similar situation in their home country. Immediately, China's annexation of Tibet and the possibility of Taiwan being next come to mind. Turkey and India are similar in that sense with Northern Cyprus and Kashmir. It demonstrates their own level of frustration with what they believe is theirs.",

Ask yourself why your thoughts immediately turn to Tibet or Kashmir, or the \"underlying show of support\" exemplified by an increase in trade, rather than a simple change in foreign policy. Did China increase trade with Russia alone, or did it not establish, through the Belt and Road Initiative, that it wants to increase trade with all countries? What makes the \"situation\" in India more similar to Russia than the United States? Where are you getting these lines of thinking from?",

This can be because either the countries are taking advantage of more demand, the proximity to Russia, or in China's case, because they're allies and their governments have similar beliefs. This graph does raise a couple questions, like why many countries opposing the invasion have increased their trade with Russia, despite that helping them. This doesn't have all too much influence in local communities, so that's not too much of a factor in this graph.

With Sweden having the highest decrease of trade.\n\nWhat I wonder: I wonder why India's amount of trade has increased with a drastic 310%. If I had to infer why it increased I would argue it could be because India would fear a Russian attack after the invasion of Ukraine. This might cause them to continue their there and increase the amount so Russia would win.\n\nHow this relates to me: As an American citizen with our amount of trade decreasing would harm Russia chance of winning the invasion. This could lead the a dispute between America's and Russia's foriegn relations.\n \nMy Headline: \" Is your Country donating to Russia's Invasion on Ukraine.
