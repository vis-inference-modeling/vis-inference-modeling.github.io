I also notice that the lowest being bought and eaten in this food plan is the section called \"other\". Which includes soda, candy, coffee, etc. I also notice that it is expected for the families to use the most money on things that are healthy for them, such as protein and vegetables. This is probably because protein and vegetables give health benefits, when the \"other\" section gives much of the opposite.\n\nI wonder why the money set aside for dairy is less than most of the other sections. I would think that people would have to spend a lot of money on items like milk, and other things that give your body dairy. I suppose this is because your body needs less dairy than protein and vegetables, or maybe dairy products just cost less. \n\nThis relates to me and my community because it could help people buy what they actually need for their bodies at the grocery store. A lot of people end up buying just a bunch of protein, and barely any other type of food like grains and vegetables, therefore not giving their body what they need. It could also show people how they can make their body healthier, by spending a lot less money on things that they need a lot less, like soda, candy, coffee and tea. \n\nHeadline: How to Budget Each Food Product!",

I think this can relate to many families of four people because this food plan gives proper nutrition for everyone.

The plan food is cost effective and a balanced diet for a family of 4.I am wondering who are the family and how their eating habits of each member, that this graph is based off. This relates to me and my community because cost efficiency is important to many families. In addition, many people find it difficult to eat and spend the most money on unhealthy people claiming that it costs too much, but graph proves that it is possible to eat healthy for an estimated price of $ 6.89 per day, regardless of family size. Honestly, I don't know what I would call this graphic, something like \"Healthy diet made affordable\" \"The price of food\"",

This makes sense because proteins and meats, are probably the most expensive items to buy at a grocery store. I also notice that all of the alternatives for dairy products are more expensive than regular products. This is not good for people who have allergies, because they have to spend more money.\n2. I wonder how much more money a person with allergies spends on a grocery trip rather than a person without allergies.\n3. As a family of 5, we spend a lot of money when buying groceries. We buy dairy free milk due to some intolerances and it is definitely more expensive. We 100% spend more than you should as well- We probably buy more than we need.\n4.

The chart has a decent breakdown consisting of a few main food groups. The chart then goes into further detail on each food group with specific foods, such as cereal, rice, and pasta within the grains category. I wonder not only what brands were bought at these prices but at what stores the items were bought. I also wonder if the fruits and vegetables are organic or not and from what state(s) most of the data is from. For my family and I\u2019s typical spending habits, the fruits are a little inflated on the chart (we usually spend $15-$20 on fruits weekly) and the vegetables are inflated on the chart ($20-$30 weekly). The grains and dairy sections were pretty accurate. For protein, we usually spend more than the chart, spending about $60 weekly between kosher chicken, nuts, seeds, and protein bars compared to the $47 on the chart. I am also curious about the consumption of the food bought. There is a lot of food that goes to waste each week and I am curious as to how much (if any) went to waste. With many hectic schedules in corporate America, plenty Americans do not cook most of their meals and thus many of the foods could be going to waste. I also wonder how much food allergies play into how much people spent in the various categories. I would title this chart: \"Mighty Meals for Four: Meals and Deals on a Budget\"",

They attempt to include a 'balanced' food model for an average family of 4 people for a total of $193 per week. At first sight, it seems like a massive help for many families who benefit from this resource.\n\nOn the other hand, They suggest a diet based on animal protein, which is the highest budget, $47, regardless of how harmful the number of antibiotics, hormones, and steroids added can be for daily consumption.\n\nNevertheless, many scientific studies have shown that the daily consumption of animal meats is directly related to cancerous diseases. Still, unfortunately, some government institutions & health organizations continue to refer people to these types of diets.\n\nAfter analyzing the \"Thrifty Food Plan,\" there is a question: is the government interested in the people's health, or is it simply looking to benefit private companies and fulfill just one more item on its agenda?\n\nI am convinced that the government should have an essential role in educating citizens. Therefore, it is not enough to give them the money. They have to provide them the tools to make informed decisions that impact their well-being and their families. Otherwise, it would be hard to decrease the number of heart disease deaths, overweight, and diabetes.",

If my math is correct, that allocates just about $48 per family member. From my personal experiences, I feel as though $48 a week for food is quite a small number. I wonder how this typical family would feel? Are they hungry everyday? Is this budget perfect for their dietary needs? For me personally, I have Celiac disease which requires me to eat gluten free foods, which are quite expensive. Flour can be as much as $18 per bag. I wonder if this budget is able to accommodate allergies. Additionally, another big thing that sticks out to me is the importance of veggies, totaling $46 per week. The most expensive portion is protein, which I can say I expected. In its subcategory, it shows just how expensive things like chicken are.

For example, Seafood was listed under Protein. The wheel adds up the total cost of what all of these foods would be for a 4 person family and comes to the conclusion that families would only have to spend near $193 per week for food. I also noticed that the healthier foods were more expensive. I know that this is generally the case everywhere because natural ingredients are not produced as quickly as artificial foods or foods that do not require growing. \n2. I wonder what the quality of all of the foods would be with such low prices. I wonder how healthy they would be if they are so cheap and it leaves me to wonder if it would be better off to spend more money on a smaller amount of natural healthy foods rather than less money on a bigger amount of preserved healthy foods. I understand that there are sacrifices that have to be made, but I believe there are smarter ways to go about these sacrifices. I also wonder if this will be enough food or if everyone will have small portions and receive the bare minimum. If this is true, I believe that this graph is deceiving because it makes it seem like you get more for less. \n3.

There are few reasons mentioned in the article. For example, increased hospital admissions, more school suspensions, lower SAT scores, and the values in the original plan were set in 1962 but had not grown since then other than being adjusted for inflation. What do you think? I suggest you re-read the original article.",

I wonder what the relative amounts typically bought in each category of food are. If you buy enough of any food, its going to cost alot, but it would be interesting to see which categories of food cost more money for the same amount. I realize this could be hard to measure because different foods are measured in different ways, but it could at least give us a sense of how much of a certain food cost a given amount. I also wonder what 'Potatoes.com' means.\n\n3. I am a vegetarian so I personally don't need to worry about the costs of meats, though the rest of my family is not. My area has very good restraunts and pretty good grocery store food, but it can be expensive. I see the effects of cheaping out on food through my school, where the food tastes like plastic, so if someone couldn't afford quality food, they could be stuck eating plastic.\n\n4.

I also notice that protein and vegetables cost the most per week with only a one-dollar difference between the two. The three categories, diaries, grains, and fruits are all within four dollars of each other. The category labelled as \"other\" is the cheapest category, which ideally should be the category that is the most nutritious and beneficial, but is not. Another thing I noticed is that the most expensive food on the chart is fruits, and the fruits cost 19 dollars. I wonder that because vegetables and poultry require more labour force and care is the reason why they are so much more expensive than everything else on the chart.

Cutting either of these expenses down could potentially save you a lot of money week to week.

I notice that the biggest amount of spending goes towards protein and vegetables, paying $47 for protein and $46 for vegetables. This seems very reasonable because those two food categories should be focused on the most when it comes to shopping. The other biggest spending categories are dairy, grains, and fruit. These are also very reasonable spending amounts because each one is a staple to a healthy diet. I wonder why they only leave $2 for tea and coffee when it would be very hard to buy those items for that price. I also wonder how achievable spending $193 a week for a family of four is. In my community, groceries are not inexpensive at all, especially depending on the store you shop at. If you shop at King's then the cost of the products will differ from products at Shoprite. I still do believe this is a great way of showing families that money can be saved when it comes to buying healthy food at the grocery store, but I am not too sure how achievable it truly is. I also notice that if these budgets are placed on food weekly then how quickly would they run out. This graph shows a food budget of $193 weekly for a family of four. I wonder why this is a weekly budget when, in a sense, it seems hard to consume a lot of these foods in a week as a family. In conclusion, this is a great outline to help families budget.

There is only one dollar difference between the two food categories since they are the most important categories for the health and growth of all family members. I also found it interesting how there are two sections of dairy, high-fat and low/non-fat. I realized that people using food stamps still need access to different options of specific foods due to allergies, health issues, or preferences in general. Looking deeper, I noticed high-fat dairy is five dollars cheaper than low-fat dairy. You would think high-fat dairy would be more expensive because the fat content seems like the valuable component of milk and other dairy products. The question I wonder is why does the Department of Agriculture give five extra dollars for non-fat dairy products? Could they just give twenty-five dollars for dairy products as a whole? In this graph, the weekly food plan for a family of four is represented in a pie graph showing the percentage of money that is spent on each food category. The cost of each category is split up even further with the price of each section as well. This graph relates to my community because a multitude of people around me, especially in my hometown, use food stamps to buy their groceries.

The amount of food that they are getting however seems like a lot and seems like a good amount for a family of 4. \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nEvery week my family goes to get groceries and my parents plan out what each meal is going to be similar to this. \n\n\"Family Food\"",

WE don't know where the money cost came from but if it is around that amount that is a lot each week. If you live somewhere different it could cost more than someone else because of where you live.",

It breaks down the 7 major food groups and then breaks those groups down even more. It shows the cost per person for one week is $6.89. I wonder where they are getting the prices for the food from. I know depending on where you live it can be cheaper or more expensive to eat.",

The middle of the graph says, \u201cWeekly food plan for a family of four.\u201d I wonder what the weekly food plan would look like for a family with more than four people.

The protein and veggies seem to be more expensive and the fruit and dairy are less expensive in the inner circle. However in the outer circle whole fruit is more expensive than other veggies. Meat in general is cheaper than poultry. I wonder if these prices were from a specific state in the country around the world or an assortment of them.",

Then it also goes more into detail about what they are going to get for each category with the price so they will stay within their price range. It looks like protein has the highest amount of money, which makes sense because meat is the most pricey in my opinion.",

And a system that 1 in 8 Americans use seems like a great avenue to cut down on the amount of meat we eat but it's not being taken advantage of. This much money seems applicable for 4 adults but not children which make up 43% of the people that rely on SNAP. Remember that these kids are also eating at school and it starts to look like a big excess.",

Change it to dried beans and fund an Instant Pot for each family to make cooking the beans quick and easy. While an Instant Pot wouldn't do for someone living without electricity, it would work with most, even people who are living in a hotel room. Honestly, I think $193 seems like a lot of money to spend on food for one week--if a person has access to an actual grocery store.",
