I heard a discussion on a radio show about my city, Wilmington, showing a decrease in bus numbers. That tells me that bus numbers are going down in more than just big cities. I think public transit needs to stay because it is a cheaper alternative for those who don't drive. But in a world dominated by cars, I can only see the numbers going farther down. Buses were a very effective system from the '60s to the early 2000s. Since I have been alive, cars dominate the road. By the time I was five, my family had three cars and that was really starting to become normal. Now, we have apps like Uber and Lyft. I think they are definitely taking passengers off buses. I wonder why the bus numbers are going up in some cities. I cannot see any reason for the number of people riding the bus to increase, so I'd really like to find out why that's happening.

Modern technology and gentrification have likely caused a reduction in public transportation services. In the last nine years the use technology and hand held devices has increased and made traveling more convenient, quicker, and cheaper. With growing technology, calling car companies like Uber is easy. Some people are now able to telecommute or work at home instead of going to work by bus. Gentrification is when old buildings, that are in the city, are replaced with costly and modern skyscrapers and condos. This is likely causing people who moved out of the city to come back in and live close to their work, allowing them to walk instead of riding the bus like before. \n\nI wonder if transit agencies are having to increase bus fees because there are less riders.

I also notice that the rate at which ridership falls/ rises varies between cities. Some levels change at more rapid rates (which is evident because of the steeper lines). Also, some cities increase before they decrease (and vice versa) and experience influxes. Something else I notice is that all the lines representing cities with decreases in bus ridership are orange, and the cities which experienced a rise are represented by grey lines (Graph 1). For the second graph, all of the lines are different colors. \n\nSomething that I wonder is why exactly this decrease in bus ridership is happening. And, is the reason the same for all of the cities or is there several reasons as to why this decline is occurring? \n\nIn these graphs, bus ridership from the years 2010/2011 to 2020 is displayed for some of the largest transit agencies in the U.S. (The second graph is four additional cities.) The overall trend is that bus ridership has decreased - pretty significantly for some of the agencies. Interestingly, several cities had influxes in certain years where the bus ridership was on the rise before finally decreasing up to 2020. For only two cities did ridership increase overall, though.

What I think is happening is that the advancement of technology is causing people to not use buses. Services like Lyft and Uber have made it insanely easy to get transit from point a to point b, without any walking like with a bus you would have to. Also, faster and more efficient trains are being designed every day, which could also be attracting people's attention. There are also a lot of people working from home because of new services that have allowed them to easily work from home and communicate with coworkers as well.

Since the majority of the population in Los Angeles are celebrities, it is quite obvious that they don\u2019t take public transportation. Another possibility could be the price of gas.

I have many possibilities on why this could've happened like maybe it happened because of the recent pandemic that was announced by WHO. I think that this pandemic has really hit places that have been affected and maybe places that didn't occur so people decided to stay home and stay safe than risking their lives with using public transportation. Public transportation is really dangerous in 2020, especially with coronavirus on the loose. I wonder why does Miami gone down so much but Portland really doesn't. Is it because Portland doesn't have too many cases or does it? Does Miami have a lot of cases or no? We wouldn't know unless we take public surveys in these areas to see what the people have to say on why they don't take public transportation. A great catchy headline for this could be, \"You missed the bus? No, I chose not to go!\".",

In the world we live in, there have been many advances in the transportation industry especially in the past four years. This is inclusive of people using ride share and growing away from public transportation. The poverty level has also gone down over the years possibly causing more people to purchase new vehicles.\nI wonder if the cause of bus riders decreasing is because more people are working remotely. The rate of people working from home has gone up quite a bit since the year 2000. This could be because of new technology advances that provide people with an easier way to work and provide companies with a decline in space needed per office making it more preferred. It could also be because of technology sales where you need to travel around to get to clients so if you have a headquarters and many other workers dispersed around the country and/or world you can get to those clients with more ease.\nCatchy Headline: Decline with an Incline",

Depending on how low/high these factors are, there could be a few reasons as to why people may not prefer to ride the bus. For, instance, in a city with higher rates of crime on their public transportation, some may turn to another forms of transportation like popular ride-sharing companies  (Uber, Lyft, etc.) many of whom are typically thought to be more convenient and reliable. There could be many other reasons as well, such as competing forms of public transportation (metro systems) or the demographics of the people who live in these cities (those with lower incomes are likelier to rely on public transportation than those with higher incomes).\nI think that a catchy headline for these graphs could be \"The Fall of America's Bus Systems\".",

As of 2020 with everything going around no one is leaving their house right now which means less transportation is needed.

I think that general decline of most cities is due to the increase in other forms of transportation such as subways, uber and other ridesharing services, and of course personal vehicles. Conversely, Seattle and San Francisco rose in ridership posing an interesting question of why only these two cities rose while the rest generally declined. It may be due to increased population of people moving to these cities and taking public transit or it may be due to improvements made to the bus system that the city has made to increase ridership.",

I wonder why public transportation ridership has gone down in big cities like New York City. I would think that it would be easier to use public transportation in a big city than use a car because there are extreme amounts of traffic and not using a car would just mean less traffic. \"Bus ridership in big cities has majorly fallen since 2010\" would be a catchy headline.",
