Before then, there is a clear trend do the length of games going up steadily but in the year 2023 there is a huge drop. I wonder what factors in baseball have contributed to this fact. It also makes me wonder about extrapolation of data and how this could prove to those that the future is always unpredictable and can always change and how predicting the future can be complete reach. This might affect the community in a positive way, the shorter the game the more a person is willing to pay attention and it might draw more attention to the sport in general.

There was a change in professional baseball's rules that resulted in the decline in the length of the game and much more.  (Can't really say exponentially, since you have only one year of decline.)  \n\nGo to this more recent graph (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/24/upshot/up-baseball-metrics.html) to see how the game's length as changed.  \n\nI wonder what the length will be by the end of the season in September.",

What do you wonder?\n\nFrom the graph, it appears that from 1980 up until 2022, baseball games were steadily increasing in game duration before a sharp decrease in 2023 The average time per match went from about 3 hours to 2 hours and 30 minutes, which may have been brought about by rule changes.\n\nWhy did the MLB decide that match length should be decreased after averaging about 3 hour match times since 2012?\n\n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\n\nThe recent rule changes affect the community by allowing people to attend games now that they end earlier. Generally, most baseball fans are working adults who may not be able to spectate games due to how long the matches are. Fans may be more willing to show up to nighttime games now that the games end earlier.\n\n\nWhat do you think is going on in this graph? Write a headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea.\n\nThe graph is showing that over time, major league baseball games have been consistently getting longer as time goes by. However, the recent rule changes in the current season have drastically cut down match times by placing timers on certain plays and position shifts during the game.  \n\n\"Baseball game times plummet to their lowest point in over 40 years following major rule changes\"",

The peak for game time duration was in twenty-twenty two, where games were averaging an length of three hours and eight minutes in duration. Due to this hefty length, the MLB made efforts to reduce meeting times, pitch delivery times, increase base sizes, and change other factors that can cause the game to be longer. It is wondered if desires to reduce game duration was caused by loss of viewers due to the hefty time consumption. Rumors have spread that fan bases throughout baseball have been decreasing, it can be assumed that people do not want to have their time consumed by a baseball game and would rather just watch fragments of the game rather than spend their money and day's time to watch. Sports are a great source of entertainment, and corporations are always looking for ways to attract more fans in order to make more money. Rule changes such as this can greatly affect sporting events and the viewer ratings, overall this may cause people in my community to want to watch baseball more often than not.

The average game duration has not increased or decreased steadily over time, and instead has altered variously. Another thing that I noticed was that baseball games were at an all time high just a few years ago. I wonder why this is because I would think games would be longer in earlier years. I also wonder what made baseball games so short before. Back in the 80s, games were around the same length they are today. This relates to my community and I because I am a baseball fan. I also have friends and family that are baseball fans. The duration of the game plays a large role in how you enjoy the game. However, I believe this depends on whether you are at the game or not. When you are at the game, it is easier to enjoy a longer game when you are there, but on TV, longer games can get boring. In this graph, the average duration of an MLB game over the years is shown.

Between the 2000s and 2005, game duration gradually decreased before increasing dramatically after that year. It peaked about 2020, with games lasting significantly longer than three hours. After 2020, the game's time reduced steadily, eventually reaching almost 3 hours.\n\n2.  I'm curious why this drop is so significant. I expected that a timed pitch clock would shorten the game, but I had no clue by how much. I believe pitchers are suddenly concerned with pitching within the allotted time frame, and they are throwing much earlier than they would usually, even though there is still plenty of time on the pitch clock. They may sense the pressure of a time constraint and pitch earlier than they would usually. But I'm not sure if this is true for most pitchers these days, or just a subset of them.\n\n3. This relates to my community because I come from a city where baseball is a prominent sport. I wonder how enjoyers of baseball will react to the average increase of baseball games just to suddenly drop in the current year.\n\n4. \"How Will New Game-Shifting Rules Change the MLB Forever\"",

I also wonder if the longest game time was because of the pandemic which everyone had to adhere to health regulations. \n\n3. This relates to me and my community because this shortens the time people have to spend on watching games, which means gatherings may be shorter. Many people enjoy baseball so mixed feelings may be involved for the shorter game times. \n\n4. Faster Game, Faster Fame",

Considering that most people nowadays now have decreased attention spans, the stretched-out nature of MLB games would not appeal to many. The reduction of baseball game durations on average in 2023 by 29 minutes, along with pitch clocks and the new PitchCom transmitters, could certainly pack the game with more action, and will undoubtedly increase the popularity of the game.

I noticed the spikes that occur after the decline like around 2005 there had been a decrease in the average game duration then a spike shortly after.\n2.I wonder what caused for 2023 to be some of the shortest games in over 40 years? I wonder what are some of the factories that cause for the average games to go up and down. Along with what was the longest and shortest game as this graph strictly showed the averages. I wonder why it fluctuates so much along with if every single baseball team is included in this as it states that it is only the first three weeks of each season. \n3.This relates to my community and I as a majority of people watch baseball on a day to day basis. Having the average baseball game be shorter can actually have affects like when a game is streaming and finishes quicker than expected there has to be a filler or even going in person to games. Along with the fact that people may not be happy that in 2023 games are quicker than almost ever since 1980.\n4. \"Time Flies at the Ballpark: Baseball Games in 2023 Among the Quickest in History\"",

Between the 2000s and 2005, game duration gradually decreased before increasing dramatically after that year. It peaked about 2020, with games lasting significantly longer than three hours. After 2020, the game's time reduced steadily, eventually reaching almost 3 hours.\n\n2.  I'm curious why this drop is so significant. I expected that a timed pitch clock would shorten the game, but I had no clue by how much. I believe pitchers are suddenly concerned with pitching within the allotted time frame, and they are throwing much earlier than they would usually, even though there is still plenty of time on the pitch clock. They may sense the pressure of a time constraint and pitch earlier than they would usually. But I'm not sure if this is true for most pitchers these days, or just a subset of them.\n\n3. This relates to my community because I come from a city where baseball is a prominent sport.

This graph was created in response to the league creating new rules to speed up the game, including a pitch clock, a limit on pickoff throws by the pitcher, and eliminating the shift.  The main thing that stands out from the graph is the largest decline in time which happened between 2022 and 2023.  This is most likely a direct result of the new rules to shorten the game.  For a majority of the years displayed on the graph, the average duration is between 2 hours and 45 minus and 3 hours.  It is also clear that in the last 10 years the games have been much longer, mostly over 3 hours.  Another thing that stands out is in 1980s, the games were even shorter than they are now.  I wonder why this occurred.  Was there less strategy 40 years ago?  Was there a pitch clock that was eliminated?  Did they have shorter innings due to less hitting?  This graph is relevant to me and my community because like myself, very few baseball fans could stand the amount of time the pitcher would take to throw the ball.

Without the rules, each plate appearance besides strikeouts takes more pitches than 30 years ago which explains why the games would take so long.\n\n2. I wonder how fans feel about this change. The main idea was of them to attract younger fans. Will they lose older fans with this though? People who have been loving the game since childhood have been taking the news with mixed feelings. Some prefer shorter games and some feel as though shorter games should mean lower prices for tickets. \n\n3. I come from a predominantly Hispanic community. One thing we love is baseball.

There was a noticeable rising trend in the average duration between the two time periods up until 2023.

The average game time was reduced to 2 hours and 39 minutes, a decrease of around 30 minutes.\n2. I wonder what prompted the MLB to implement these new rules. Could implementing these new regulations make the game more interesting for baseball fans? Could the reason as to why games took longer be due to the lack of technology to review invalid plays? Could this have caused baseball fans from before to lose interest in the sport?\n3. This relates to me and my community because baseball is one of the most popular sports so when it develops, I'm curious how competitions at the middle and high school levels will change. Also, it is now known that technology has taken over the entire world and how this could affect how people watch. Younger generations in particular have spent our entire lives viewing brief video clips and parts and haven't really had the attention span to sit through a 3-hour movie, much less a sporting event.

    "comment info": "Evan Morgans, Strath Haven High School\n\nWhat do you notice? \n- I notice that the reduction of the game is about 29 minutes, which is quite a large amount of time taken from a sports game, especially baseball. I understand this change is meant to engage more people to watch games and to make the games more competitive, along with the addition of the other rules, though these changes don't seem necessary. Fielders are no longer allowed to adjust to certain batters, which feels like a nitpick more than a crucial change to the game. Most of these changes feel like exactly that, a nitpick to gain more revenue. \nWhat do you wonder?\n- I wonder if these changes actually helped generate more viewers for games and if the games this season are actually \"more competitive\". \nImpact on community\n- There's not much impact, since watching baseball is purely entertainment. Though to the baseball community, it's quite a big impact with generally mixed reviews. For regular viewers, this is only a negative since they would have already had the time to take to watch MLB games. Though now it's shorter, and they're missing a lot more of what they love about the sport, almost 30 minutes worth of time. Though for casual watchers who'll watch once in a while with family, this is a welcome change. They usually don't care enough to spend 3 hours of time to watch, so now when they decide to watch they have almost 30 minutes saved out of their day. \nTitle\n- Length of baseball games over the years",

The average game duration has decreased by 15%, according to the line graph. The graph gradually increased over the decades, with several peaks: games typically lasted about 2 hours and 35 minutes in 1980, but by 1995, they had increased to about 3 hours. \n2. I'm curious why the MLB imposed additional regulations for pitch clock time and hitter ready time. How long would it take pitchers and batters to warm up, causing the games to last so long? Will popularity increase because the games last less time than usual, attracting more people to watch without the hassle of letting time interfere with other priorities? \n3. This is relevant to me and my community because there are many students in high school who are extremely passionate about baseball and devote a significant amount of time to the sport. I know a couple of students in the baseball program who may want others to become interested in the sport as well, which may come in handy now that game times have been drastically reduced. The time change benefits fans because they will spend less time watching baseball games and will be able to focus more on studying or other personal priorities. \n4. What a Moon Shot!

Baseball takes rule changes very seriously.  \n\nHow do you think that the rule changes will affect baseball statistics like hits, strikes and steals?  Could they challenge past records?  Is this \u201cfair\u201d to past record holders?  (Think about past changes, including the number of games in a season and the designated hitter.  How did they affect baseball statistics?)",

The lowest it has ever gone since the 1980s was roughly 2 hours and 46 minutes in 2008. From 2022 to 2023, there was a significant linear reduction from an average of 3 hours and 8 months to 2 hours and 39 minutes, a difference of over 29 minutes. The games were the longest ever during the pandemic, most likely due to all of the health standards that had to be followed. \n\n-I'm curious as to why the dramatic reduction occurred in 2022. I'm also curious about whether baseball will become a more efficient and popular sport. I'm especially curious how engaged or disinterested individuals have gotten in the sport as a result of the new scheduling. Are pitch clocks reducing player performance? \n\n-This does not directly affect me, but it does affect some of the individuals in my community. Many adults in my town aspire to play in the Major League Baseball, and with fewer opportunities to do so, they will have to start training harder. In addition, I've been wanting to witness a basketball game, and the fact that it's shorter in length will make the experience more pleasurable.\n\n-Are MLB games becoming speedless or worthless?",

Up to 2023, there was a pretty substantial upward tendency in the average duration between the two time periods. The steepest decline within this graph occurs between 2022 and 2023, which would indicate the new regulations were the most stringent ones put in place during that \ntime. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI'm curious as to what led the MLB to adopt these new regulations. Implementing these rules could make the game more efficient for baseball players and baseball fans alike because, in my opinion, games lasting longer than three hours are very lengthy. \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nMe personally, I don't really watch baseball like that, but when I do, it is always very interesting to watch, so seeing this news has me very delighted to see this trend. Games now move along considerably more quickly and feature more exciting on-field action. There is little doubt that players seem to have improved and grown to the game's changes quite fast. However, being too long is part of the reason as to why I don't really watch baseball, so I would say a decrease in timing could benefit them and cause people to start watching again. \n\nWhat's going on in this graph?\n\"More Time To Play Ball!: Is It Really The longer the better?\"",

Why are the games shorter, did they have less rescoures did they make more money for people who came to the games than the food stands how much better was food back then.?\nThis commits to our community becuase the rules made in the 80s and the ones now are differed by huge changes",

The average duration time hits its peak during 2020 before severely declining in 2022. I can also notice between 1990 and 2010, the average game duration time mostly stayed between  2 hours and 45 minutes to 3 hours.\n\nI wonder if the effects and aftermath of COVID had something to do with the decline in game duration time since severe protocols were probably put in place. I also wonder if the new generation of baseball players affected how the games play out during the seasons making them shorter or their play decisions. Could this also do with the advertisements being broadcasted on live TV or the attention span of the audience as baseball evolved over time?\n\nThis relates to my community because it has been known that technology has taken over the whole world. Specifically with the younger generations, we are grown up watching short clips of videos and segments and never really had the attention span to sit through a 3-hour movie, much less a sports game.

Since 1980 this current year is the lowest three opening week game time duration. Scoring will be increases as less time is given to the pitcher giving more time for the player at bat to get hits causing more high scoring games. So this would directly lead to more points on the end score. This may lead to more people attending the game with action happening almost every other pitch will have people out their seats lowering the actually game duration as well.\n\nHow will this affect the speed of the game?\nDoes this make it easier or harder for teams to score/defend?\nHow will this change attendance throughout the MLB?\n\nBeing a Major Hispanic community many of us tune into baseball and aspire to be on a MLB field so seeing more action and popularity throughout the sport will only cause more people in my community to grow to want to be in the MLB.

I also noticed that before the rule change, game duration had increased by about 30 minutes since 1980.

The graph shows other fairly sharp drops and peaks, so I wonder if there were any rule changes or changes in MLB broadcasting that caused those changes in average game duration. I also wonder how players feel about the change, because it likely disrupts their game rhythm and requires them to adapt to a faster pace of play.\n\nThis relates to me because I have been a fan of the MLB for a while and I found the games to be slow and at times boring compared to other sports like basketball and football.

In addition, I observed that since 1980, the typical game lasts longer compared with three hours. The mid-2000s saw a modest fall between the peak between the middle of the 1990s and the mid-2010s. Changes to the rules can have been made to shorten this time period as well. The biggest decline occurs between 2022 and 2023, most likely as a result of the pitch time change and the introduction of transmitters for the pitcher and catcher to reduce time spent delaying. I believe that the restriction on infield shifting and the longer bases would lengthen playtime.\n2.I'm curious about the data's sample size for 2023. The new restrictions have undoubtedly cut down on the amount of time, but the 2023 baseball season is still in its infancy.

I feel like this is the graph that has provided the least information as compared to others in the series. I do appreciate how straightforward it is, though.\n\nI wonder what exactly these new rules are and how thorough they are. Do they specifically reference reducing time through shortening game time, such as lowering points requirements, or do they attempt to reduce time by speeding up game set-up and clean-up? I wonder about the shortest and longest MLB game time ever and the cause.\n\nI am not an avid baseball fan, but I went to a Giants game, which was fun, more so because of the carnival-like atmosphere in the stadium than the game itself.

I also wonder if the longer games impacted the players or the audience. Are they being shortened because people couldn\u2019t sit and watch a three-hour game or were the players getting worn out? As the rest of the season continues, will this pattern of a decrease in duration continue or will it rise back up to three hours? \nI used to watch my local baseball games on TV and remember thinking they were the longest sports match out of any sport. One of my close friends is very involved in baseball and has been talking about the change of rules and the visualization helps to show the difference the new rules are making. \nI would title this: \u201cMajor effects of new rules in Major League Baseball\u201d",

If the y-axis were percentage change in game duration, what would that look like?  Why do you think the graph designer did not use percentage change?\n\nWhy are there no tick marks for the years?

However, in 2022-2023 there is a dramatic decrease. At the height of game times it was at roughly 3 hour and 10 minutes a game and then in 2022 it dropped to 3 hours and 8 minutes and then to a solid 2 hours and 39 minutes in 2023. I wonder why it took the MLB to instill this rule into the games until 2020, if they saw the increase, why did they wait so long? This relates to my community because i\u2019ve gone to various baseball games and MLB games where i\u2019ve recently seen the pitch clock be implemented. Although it does make baseball games shorter, I don\u2019t think i\u2019m rather fond of the pitch clock. It makes the game feel more rushed and there is less control that the players have in the game. In this graph it shows the change in MLB game times in correlation to years from 1980 to 2023.",

The last time the game's duration lasted around 2:39 was in the 80s. The year 2020 has the longest timing within the data. Overall, statistically, this graph illustrates a fluctuation as each year has somewhat of a change in the time durations of a baseball game. \n\n2) The biggest question is why such a sudden change in the duration of games. I wonder since the 1980s had a similar time duration as 2023, how was baseball played at that time? For example, we know 2023 lowered the duration because of new rule changes - what rules did the 1980s have to have baseball games last about 2 hours and 35 min? Moreover, what rules were enforced in baseball games in 2020 that led games to have a duration of 3 hours and 10 minutes? \n\n3) Since we are in spring and soon to be entering summer, the sport that is very popular in my community is baseball.

Some other things that I noticed are that from around 2000 and 2010, game durations were lower and then started increasing the next decade.  \n\nI don't really watch baseball but the thing that I'm wondering is, if there wasn't a pitch clock before, then theoretically could a baseball pitcher stall the whole game?  Maybe not to the extent of the whole game but for certain periods of time that will tire out the opposing team and make them impatient.  To be honest I'm surprised that no such thing as a clock existed in baseball already.\n\nThis relates to my community because I know that baseball is one of those sports that is played a lot recreationally and is played at high levels in high school, college, and beyond.  A new implementation of a pitch clock after all these years seems like a big rule change and can really affect how games are played nowadays.\n\nThe Major League Takes A New Step!: The Pitch Clock",

It also seems that since the 1980s, baseball game lengths have been steadily increasing. \n\nI wonder if the decrease in-game time impacts the revenue generated by the MLB from advertisements and concession sales. Could the increasing length of the game be due to the rise of TV advertisements? Could shortening the game make advertisers less likely to run ad campaigns through baseball games? I also wonder if changing the base sizes increases the number of hits and runs scored. \n\nThis change relates to my community because I am an avid sports fan and frequently watch MLB games.

There could have been some rule changes to reduce time in this time period too. 2022-2023 has the steepest drop, most likely due to the pitch time and the pitcher and catcher getting transmitters so there would be less time stalling. I think the ban on infield shifting and larger bases would increase time on the field.\n\nI wonder why and how these changes, especially the pitch clock, are being enforced. Are there penalties for going over the pitch clock? How much time is given to the pitcher's team?\n\nThis relates to me because I played baseball when I was younger and I enjoy watching MLB baseball games. I feel that the pitch clock and transmitters reduce the amount of time spent standing on the field.

To illustrate this, the graph makes a point to show us that the average game time in the 2022 season was 3:08, which is much higher than the 2023 average game time of 2:39.  This is a steep decrease from what has been seen in years prior, where the average time has been almost steadily increasing since around 1980.  This decrease in game time makes me wonder numerous things, such as how this affects ticket sales, as now fans are paying the same amount of money to spend less time at the ballpark.  Additionally, it raises the question of whether pitchers' accuracy is affected by the pitch clock, as the clock adds a sense of urgency to the pitcher, which may lead to more inaccurate pitches.

    "comment info": "Previously, baseball game durations witnessed regular fluctuations, however there was still a gradual increase in the overall average game duration. However, the 2022-2023 school year experienced a steep decline in average game duration that was almost as low as that of 1980. In those 40 years, there was never a shift that drastic. \n\nI wonder how closely the rule changes and this decrease in average game duration are related. Were the rule changes purely due to observations by the MLB, or was the MLB experiencing a sharp decline in viewership due to the seemingly never-ending games? Even for those who are not baseball fans, one thing most people are aware of is that baseball games tend to last hours on end. My prediction is that over time, people\u2019s attention spans have gotten too short to sit through entire games. \n\nBaseball is a very popular sport in America. There are many baseball fans in my own community. The decision may impact this select community positively, as they can watch their favorite teams play without dedicating hours on end to watching games. However, it could also impact them negatively, as there are some baseball fans that enjoy the entire experience and do not want games to feel rushed. My prediction is that ordinary people might become more inclined to start watching baseball, however those who are already baseball fans might not appreciate this new change as much. \n\nPitch Perfect or Not?

Looking at the graph, this is the shortest average game duration in the past three decades.\n\nI wonder if the average game durations will stay around the 2 hour 39 minute mark or if they will be shorter or longer in the following years.

The drop this year is mostly due to the pitch clock, which sets a limit on the time between pitches.

I\u2019m not aware of any rule changes made during that time so I wonder what factors played into the increase. I also wonder if the MLB will continue to implement changes to make the games go faster or if they are satisfied with the game duration right now.\nAs someone who watches baseball occasionally, the pitch clock has definitely made a noticeable difference in the pace of the game.

Looking at the graph before 2023, the average game duration was on a rocky but steady increase, having grown from ~2hr 35 mins in 1980 to ~3hr 12mins in 2022. In 2023, the average game length was 2hr 39 mins, nearly back to the average time over 40 years before.\n\nI wonder why the average time increased so much before 2023. The description noted that this dramatic decrease in time is most likely due to the new rules put into place, especially the implication of the pitch clock. There are several other rules added, such as a ban on the infield shift and bigger bases. I wonder how these other changes may have also affected the shortened time.\n\nThis does not directly affect me because I would not identify myself as a baseball fan nor do I play baseball, but I have many friends and family members who are and I am sure that these changes and the shorter average duration of a game will change the way they watch and enjoy baseball.\n\nHeadline: \u201cMajor Changes in the Major Leagues: How New Rules Have Striked Out Lengthy Game Times\u201d",

It\u2019s interesting to examine how this trend has fluctuated over the years with game time reaching a high water mark in the early 2010s. Back in the 1980s, however, games were approximately 2.5 hours long - roughly the same as the times this year.\n\nGiven that the data was taken through the first three weeks of the season, I wonder if this plot would change if data from entire seasons were used. It\u2019s possible that weather and seasonality might alter these numbers or if players got more used to the new rules changes. \n\nI\u2019m a baseball fan, so this trend is definitely something I was cognizant of and excited to see.

How might this impact the stats? Could this have an effect on the team standings? What caused the game time to go down so much around 2005 - 2006? Why was the game time so short in the 80s?

This low is close to the time of baseball games in the early 1980's, which hovered around 2 hours and 30 minutes.  This length of the game was caused by a change of rules aimed to make the time of the game run short.\n\n2. I wonder why new runs have been implemented aimed to make the game shorter.  Is it possible that baseball is declining in viewership, and the MLB are attempting to shake things up.  Maybe a new set of rules will draw the attention of old and new fans.  It's also possible the shorter timespan of the gamers will allow for more consumable watch times for a wider audience.\n\n3. My community doesn't watch baseball very often, if at all.

Maybe as a more modernized form of viewing happens we as an audience are more suited to receive clips of games than full length games. \n\nBaseball is a very prevalent sport for those in my community and a lot of people I've met use it as an escape, my dad and I would watch baseball games when I was younger and it was a good form of bonding. The times being cut down could potentially mean that the networks want a more serialized version of the game where they can't find loopholes in the rules.\n\n\"Run! Run!

The average game duration in the first 3 weeks of the 2022 MLB season was 3:08, and this year it drastically decreased to a game duration of 2:39 hours on average in the first 3 weeks of the season. I wonder why game durations began to mostly increase from 1980 to 2022, and how the changes in the MLB\u2019s rules have contributed to the overall increasing trend for most of the graph. I also wonder if game durations are related to the overall evolution of baseball players since the 1980s, since sportsmen and women have generally improved over time with new technologies, strategies, and training regimens. This relates to me because I have seen this graph a few weeks ago in one of my college Statistics courses, where we had a discussion as to why there appears to be a significant decrease in the average MLB game duration from 2022 to 2023: the MLB officially implemented a new pitch timer rule which limits the time that pitchers have to pitch the ball to 15 seconds when there aren\u2019t men on bases and 20 if there are.

Hypothetically, players were the best they have ever been in 2022, as new training techniques would allow massive gains in skill level.\n\n3) This relates to me and my community because being from San Diego, many of my peers are Padres fans. For the more casual fans such as myself, games can stretch to an undesirable length, so these changes make the game more accessible.\n\n4) There is a plot comparing year against average game duration, where it is seen to be staggered yet increasing from 1980 to 2022, then a large downturn in 2023.

Do health and nutrition have an ongoing impact on how long a game lasts? I'm curious about the primary reason why the games are getting shorter.\n\n3)This graph, in my opinion, is relevant to my area since, if pitching has recently been given its own time limit at the big league level, it is possible that this will happen soon at all baseball levels, including the collegiate level where several of my friends play the game.

Does the decrease in game duration at all change pricing for tickets? What had in the past caused the increases in game time? Does the pitch clock negatively or positively make any changes to a players performance? Because players have less time and are because of this pressure and bad throws, could this also eventually also cause longer games again because pitchers have to throw more.\n\nThe length is the reason that i\u00b4ve heard many people use as to why they dont attend the length, this could make attending games realistic for a lot of people including myself as a student.\n\nM.L.B.

    "comment info": "1.) What I noticed is that the amount of time an average game took to play in the MLB from 2022-23. It's interesting how low the average game time dropped to, almost as low as it was in 1980. This is likely due to the new pitch clock mentioned, that places a time limit on how long a pitcher can take to throw. \n2.) I wonder why this drop is incredibly significant. I thought that the game time would decrease with a timed pitch clock, but I had no idea by that much. I think maybe pitchers now have to worry about pitching within the given time slot, and now make their throws much earlier than they normally would, even if there is still a lot of time on the pitch clock. They might feel that pressure of being on a time limit, and pitch earlier than they normally would. But I wonder if this is truly the case for most pitchers now, or just some of them.\n3.) I think this graph relates to my community because if pitching has now gotten its own time limit at the major league level, maybe soon this will become an implementation at all levels of baseball, even at the college level with my friends who do baseball. they might also have to worry about pitching sooner than they normally would, and it could mess up their focus.\n4.)

    "comment info": "1.  In this graph, I notice that game time for baseball increased the most between 1985 and 1995. The game duration began to decline gradually between the 2000s and 2005, before increasing dramatically after that year. It peaked around 2020, with games lasting much longer than 3 hours. The game's time decreased rapidly after 2020, eventually reaching 2 hours and 39 minutes. \n\n2.  I'm curious about what caused the increase in baseball duration from the beginning of 1980 to 1995. Was this because there were fewer talented players between these time periods, and the players simply took longer to complete? Or was there an outside factor at work here? Was there anything else that made the MLB realize that their games were going on for too long and that they needed to change something and certain rules? Why were the games so long in recent years but not in previous years?\n\n3. I am from the Dominican Republic, where baseball is the most popular sport, and it will be interesting to see how baseball fans react to this change. \n\n4. \"Ace: M.L.B Tries Speeding Games Up\"",

This big of a decrease is huge to the sport as it allows viewers to see more action. One thing that I thought about was how the graph only has data through the first three weeks of the season. all the other data points are averages through the entire season. I wonder if the lower game times will continue throughout the season. This relates to me and my community because I am an athlete and I quit baseball because it was to slow for me.

    "comment info": "Generally speaking, I like the display of this graph. It is simple, yet still communicates the intended message very clearly. The axis labels are in large enough font to easily follow, the lack of color makes the intended numbers stand out. The data-ink ratio is carried out very well. There are no unnecessary words, figures, etc., the axis values are consistent, and the two labeled data points clearly depict a drastic change in game time for M.L.B. games. I do think it will be interesting to see how this new rule change will affect the popularity of the sport. I think it will increase the popularity. Given that baseball games do not consist of constant action, a shorter game might keep fans more engaged. \nBefore this year I did not know much about baseball at all, but I have attended a couple of my university\u2019s games this season and my only complaint about the sport is how long the games are. I love the environment of a baseball stadium and the excitement of the crowd, but three hours of baseball is far too much for me. I am more than supportive of the pitch clock if that means a slightly shorter game. \nA catchy headline for this graph could be, \u201cBaseball: America\u2019s Pastime is Catching up to Speed\u201d",

I also noticed that around the year 2021, the average time duration had also hit its peak. The average time has consistently been changing since 1980 and has not been consistent for any year.\n2. I wonder if the new rules were not implemented, would in future years the average time duration surpasses the 3 hr 15 min mark? I wonder if the baseball fans had anything to do with the change since they might have felt that a 3 hour game is a very long time. I also wonder what caused the 3 hour peak in the year 1995 since the averages of the other years were way lower. \n3. This relates to me and my community because my family loves to watch baseball but at home. The games are too long and most of us don't like being in one place for multiple hours. At home, watching the games on tv, we can do other things while the game is on but no one really sits and watches for the entire game time. If the average game time keeps reducing, we would probably go watch a game in person since it won't be as long.\n4. Hit The Winning Home Run Before The Time Strikes You Out",

The average game duration is almost the lowest it has ever been. This change is a direct effect of the new pitch clock that was implemented into the game, a rule that I personally think was great for the game. \n\nOne thing I wonder is will we continue to see the same pitch clock moving forward, a new modified pitch clock, or will they get rid of it all together? I hope that they continue to grow of the current pitch clock and make it better.\n\nThis relates to me and my community because I am an athlete who grew up playing baseball along with other sports.
