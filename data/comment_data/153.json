The graph shows a higher concentration of derailed train cars in the north of the east coast than in the south of the same coast. \n\nI wonder if the pattern we see is because the east of the country has significatively more trains than the other part of The United States. So by having more trains, more accidents happen. \n\nThis relates to my community because I live on the East Coast, so we are at a greater risk of having or seeing derailed train cars, and this can be very tragic to any community. \n\nHow derailed train cars look like on the United States map.",

Another thing I see is that while Pennsylvania and Ohio are highlighted because of recent incidents, the midwest as a whole has an alarmingly high number of derailments.\n\n2.  I wonder if the derailing trains were produced by the same company. Was the conductor's driving to blame? Alternatively, how was the train made? Just wondering who is held accountable for these events.\n\n 3.  Although there haven't been any recent recordings of any derailments in my neighborhood, I had no idea how frequent they are in the US.

But when I looked closer I saw that the East coast had more railroads compared to the west coast and most of the railroads meet in one central location and then branch out from that location. I wonder how many trains have to be coming in at one central speed to cause this derailment. For example how does the mixup of the trains coming in affect the amount of derailments that happen.

As shown in the graph, from 1975 to 2022, Pennsylvania and Ohio seem to have the most derailments as they are highlighted. \n\n2) What do you wonder?\nI wonder why train derailments keep occurring. If times have advanced, why can't there be a way to modify railroad lines in order to prevent trains from derailing? I also wonder if these derailments constantly happen on the same rails or different ones in the states that this situation has occurred.\n\n3) How does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to me and my community as I live on the east coast near the chemical affected states. There is a train station in our city that many people take to go back and forth and with the knowledge that trains have been derailing more often, it's hard not to think about whether or not it'd happen here. A derailed train near or in our community can impact many lives negatively.\n\n4) What\u2019s going on in this graph?

Furthermore, I also notice that in Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Ohio, a significant number of train cars have derailed. Also, in southern California and southeast Texas, there seems to be a very high population of derailed train cars. \n2. I wonder what causes trains to derail. It is clearly not from the weather, as the largest places of derailed train cars are throughout different climates in America. I also wonder if the number of derailed train cars is simply due to the high number of rail lines in each city or location. If there are not as many train lines, I assume that there would be less of a chance to have a high number of derailed train cars. \n3. This is important to me and my community because train cars can be very dangerous. If there is a high number of non-functioning train cars, it is important to be aware of this and understand your surroundings. I did not know this was such a prevalent issue with train cars. \n4.

This could be because trains aren\u2019t used as much in the west as they are in the east and because of that, railways in the east are less likely to be fixed because all the transit and transport going over them would be halted or postponed if they were to be mended. If a railroad tie is sticking up out of the track and someone hasn\u2019t been able to fix it because of the distance it is away from civilization or because of the mass of traffic in that area, a train is more likely to be derailed there.\nI wonder why areas near water are more likely to be areas of derailments. I would assume it\u2019s because rails would be slick or more likely to freeze. I also inferred that the reason so many more accidents happen in Appalachia is because of the many mountains and sharp turns hide in the mountains.\nFortunately, this doesn\u2019t impact me in Elk County, since we have very few trains that come through our town.

Ohio and Pennsylvania are highlighted, most likely because they were most affected by the recent event.  However, there is quite a few in those states specifically.  A decent majority of the derailments occurred in the eastern part of the country, but that is most likely due to the amount of rail lines.  There is more train lines in the states on the east in comparison to some of the midwestern states such as Utah and Nevada.  I also noticed how some of the dots are much larger, which I am assuming signals a higher frequency of derailments.  I wonder why these have occurred so much over the past nearly 50 years.  Railroads have been around for well over 100 years, so it seems it would be more likely that our technology has advanced enough to fix this.  I also wonder if any plans have been put in place to address this.  This relates to me and my community because derailments can be extremely dangerous so it is essential to know this.

I wonder why there are so many areas where trains derailing are recurrent , if they happen so  often wouldn't there be some kind of solution to the problem?

I think the reason why the midwest has so many railroads is because there is a smaller, more spread-out population in this part of America. Then, in areas with more railroads and more people, there seem to be more derailments. How can this be prevented? I also wonder why Ohio and Pennsylvania are highlighted in this graph. \nThis relates to me and my community because recently, we have all been affected by the Ohio derailment. Toxic chemicals were released into the environment. Hopefully, in the future, these derailments are less common. \nHeadline: Off the Rails",

One thing I notice is that the midwest as a whole has an unacceptably high amount of derailments, even though Pennsylvania and Ohio are highlighted due to recent accidents. I found that the center midwest and the majority of the US's eastern region have the most derailments. Throughout the Western States, there is a tiny, dispersed group of derailed trains.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nGiven that trains are one of the oldest modes of transportation, I wonder if they have been modernized with more modern equipment. Might the problem with the trains derailing be with the actual railway rails? Could the weight of the cars be the result of too many passengers utilizing the train? Why is the Midwest the region with the highest concentration compared to the east and west coasts of the US? In the Midwest, where there are a lot of train derailments, how can people still use trains as a mode of transportation?\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis is relevant to me and my neighborhood because of the train station in my town, which some people use to travel to towns farther distant from us or to other nearby townships.

We see an extensive amount of dots, or in this case, train derailments throughout the east coast as well. In the map Ohio and PA are highlighted, this could be due to the high amounts of train derailments in that area. \n\n-I wonder if the amount of derailed autos in the east is more than anywhere else connected to urbanization and population? What is causing the damage to these vehicles? What was the initial cost of the cargo malfunctioning?\n\n-This is relevant to me and my community because my state or town is close to these states, and changes in those areas may eventually reach my state. The train is a major mode of transportation in my city, and if all of the trains are derailed, most people would be unable to travel to work or other important destinations.

    "comment info": "1. I see that on this map, the majority of derailed trains occur in the East rather than the West. In some counties, the damage from these events in the East happens much more frequently. There are numerous smaller accidents, but very few derailments that have a significant impact. It's also crucial to remember that many of these incidents have occurred over the course of 47 years, so despite how many derailed train cars may seem to have appeared all at once, there haven't actually been that many in a short amount of time.\n\n2.  I wonder what causes these train cars to derrail, and why do they do so more frequently in some places than others. Is it because there are more rail lines there, or could it be a problem with the internal engineering of the rails? Also, how many people have died as a result of these accidents, if any?\n\n3. I grew up near train tracks in the East, but I've never heard of a train derailing. I am also very close to Pennsylvania, so this might be affecting some goods that are being transported to different states.\n\n4. \"Off The Rails: 47 Years of Derailed Train Cars\"",

One thing I see is that while Pennsylvania and Ohio are highlighted because of recent incidents, the midwest as a whole has an alarmingly high number of derailments. I discovered that the majority of the US's eastern region and its central midwest have the most derailments. There is a small, dispersed collection of derailed trains in the Western States.\n\n2. I wonder if the trains were updated with newer technology since one of the oldest ways of transportation was using trains. Could the actual train rails be the issue in which the trains are derailing? Could there be too many people using the train and it could be the weight of the cars? Why is it concentrated most in the midwest compared to the east and west coasts of the United States? How can people still continue to use a train as a form of transportation in the Midwest when there's lots of train derailments occurring? \n\n3.

One detail I see is that although Ohio and PA are highlighted due to current events, the midwest as a whole has a concerning amount of derailments. Overall, I noticed that the Eastern US and the majority of the midwest experience the most derailments. While in the Western US, has a minor scattered collection of derailed trains.\n\n2) I wonder if the trains that were derailing are from the same manufacturer. Was it on the conductor's driving? Or the manufacturing of the train? I'm just curious about who gets the blame for these incidents. \n\n3) There haven't been any recordings lately of any derailments in my community, but I was very much unaware of how much occurs in the US.

Additional clusters occur in the vicinity of Ohio and Pennsylvania. This is due to narrower train lines on the east side. The rise of derailed train carriages has been attributed to industrialization.\n\n-Is the amount of derailed autos in the east more than anywhere else connected to urbanization and population? What is causing the damage to these vehicles? What was the initial cost of the cargo malfunctioning?\n\n-This is relevant to me and my community because my state or town is close to these states, and changes in those areas may eventually reach my state. The train is a major mode of transportation in my city, and if all of the trains are derailed, most people would be unable to travel to work or other important destinations.

We see an extensive amount of dots, or in this case, train derailments throughout the east coast as well. In the map Ohio and PA are highlighted, this could be due to the high amounts of train derailments in that area. \n\nWhat do I wonder?\nWell first of all I wonder how extensive the trail derailments had to be to end up on the map. The most recent Ohio train derailment was extremely dangerous and extensive, but does that mean all of the dots include dangerous derailments? I also wonder what location has to do with these accidents, why do more pop up around the midwest but not towards the left of the map? Lastly, I wonder what happened around Illinois that earned it the biggest dot on the entire map.\n\nHow does this relate to me and my community? \nThis relates to me and my community because living in New Jersey makes me part of the East Coast, which is important when analyzing this graph because we are not in a train derailment-free zone.

I also noticed a big spot around the Chicago. I think the reason for these train derailments is that a lot of these trains go on tight tracks that are very narrow and the trains can easily derail often these narrow tracks are found in Railroad Crossings or tight bridges or going through cities or behind houses. For example I live in the woods and behind my house there are train tracks. Trains do not come through that often (They are not passenger trains BTW.) They are freight trains just like the one that derailed in East Palistine and they may have toxic chemicals in them.

There seems to be a line down the center of the country; the East appears to have more derailments, generally. We think this may have to do with population density of East vs. West.

It was found to be several times higher than in the air than the levels in downtown Pittsburgh on the same day.  Acorlein is also a product of automobile exhaust and has long been considered a potential health hazard in traffic tunnels.  The acorlein half-time (the time for half of it to decay) is on the order of less than a day, but if the input rates exceeds this then it will build up in air.  Wind may help dissipate acorlein but they could simple transfer the problem to a different place.
