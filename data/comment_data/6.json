    "comment info": "STEM jobs have higher wages than Humanities and English majors do. I think this wage gap has to do with the fact that there is a higher demand for STEM than English, for example, because we as a society are making further advancements in the field than other areas of study. The graph presents an important factor: the monetary value of teachers is much lower than other majors. It also omits many key factors, such as the amount time spent at a job and other necessary pieces of info, which is peculiar because this graph is supposed to show the future of careers. I can infer that the author wants the audience to focus on the salaries of these jobs, even though it completely defies the purpose of job, which is to do something that you feel can help contribute to the world. The author shines a light on a society obsessed with the monetary value of a job, instead of the job itself.",

Why is there such a large range in the amount of money a person makes in each field why do certain people make less than others for the same job. This graph shows that even if you get a job with a lower minimum wage you can still make as much as a job that pays its average worker much more. It also shows jobs that you have to work harder for and go to school longer for can still make you less money.",

A median, as well as a 10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentile, are plotted on the graph as they locate and quantize the range of projected salaries that populations within each field receive. The varying majors located on the left display a common trend, in that the majors related to science and economy gravitate towards the higher end of the spectrum while other jobs, namely government paid vocations, lean towards the lower end. There remains an outlier on the last major, chemical engineering, as their median as well as their range are noticeably higher than all other majors. As the title states how these earnings are for college graduates, it can be inferred that the graph is intended for students looking for different types of jobs and depicts the monetary incentive for each career type. Nonetheless, a large amount of factors are omitted within this graph as certain components, such as what amount of time constitutes a career, are never specified.

The median numbers increases as the list goes down and they usually lean towards the left of the blue. The higher earning figures tend to be in the S.T.E.M. field as compared to the others. Due to the growing demand of progress, those careers are often paid larger amounts for their work. The top earning S.T.E.M. majors seem to have more competition compared to wider fields such as philosophy and are harder to get a job in than the rest. Even though those fields are going to be useful in the future, we as a society need to appreciate other fields like Education and Social more. Those fields are just as important in lending a hand in progressing our society and they deserve a higher salary than they are getting currently. The graph does not tell the whole story, factors such as location, economy, if its a government or company job, and degree of difficulty effects how much a person makes during a career. The graph is likely to change in the future because of the changing economy we have today. If a majority in College chose Chemical Engineering due to this graph, the career earnings would go down drastically due to a drop in competition. I would not recommend this graph for choosing a career because of the factors that do not go into it.",

Therefore, we can imply that government salaries tend to be lower than science majors such as chemical engineering or computer science, which are located near the lower part of the graph with higher median ranges. Because the graph shows different career paths, their main audience are incoming teens who have to decide their majors for college. In the end, based on this graph students may choose one of these careers solely on money.  However, I wonder if this information is completely accurate for students in fours years who may have to decide their fields of study now. Not only that but there are many other factors that contribute to deciding one's field of study.

This trend implies that people do not value the language and social-based careers enough even though I believe they do play a significant role in the infrastructure of society and the development of citizens\u2019 minds. Also, while the median career earning does increase from the top to bottom of the graph, the range between the 10th and 90th percentiles also generally increases. The greater dispersion of career earnings may be a result of many people wanting to go into higher paying careers. Greater competition would be generated, causing a wider spectrum in the amount of money people in the same career path can earn. Thus, job availability should be taken into consideration along with the projected earnings. It is not wise to choose a career path based solely on the information shown by this graph because it is lacking the consideration of factors without a monetary incentive, such as satisfaction and passion\u2014it is important for people to love their careers.

With more people applying for similar positions, companies can pay workers lower salaries. Another factor, besides supply and demand, is passion. What the graph fails to consider is that some college students choose a certain career path out of passion or love for a subject.

I had not really thought about what you had said about how with increasing popularity of certain STEM careers, eventually wages for these jobs may greatly decrease due to the large amount of people in that industry. Career incomes could change greatly in the future as we have no way to tell what will happen to certain jobs and the income they make. While a career may be in high demand right now, and therefore could have a high income, in the future the demand may die down and people might earn much less in that career, or the other way around. Also, I think passion is something extremely important in deciding which career as student should follow, and by not considering this in his graph, students may choose careers simply due to high earnings rather than what they would enjoy doing for the rest of their lives.",

In addition, most of the careers with median wages of $3 million or higher are STEM based, while careers with median wages that fall below $3M are based primarily on sociology, language, history, or the arts. I wonder if such discrepancy between career types is due to a higher demand for workers in scientific and mathematical fields, than others that fall outside of STEM. Although there are exceptions to this rule, the general pattern of the graph supports the idea that the economy favors STEM based careers. In my opinion, the graph seems to advise college students deciding on a major to enter these fields, using solely money as a motivation. I personally disagree with the notion that one should reconsider their major based on earnings alone because these statistics are subject to change and if one has no business in chemical engineering, then they should not enter such a career they are not adept at, nor take interest, in for the pay.

I believe the reason for this falls under supply and demand. Even though Chemical Engineering can be considered as a much more difficult job than Psychology, it all depends on if the place where they live really needs a Psychologist or a Chemical Engineer. So for this reason, when looking at the 75th to 90th percentile I see that the Chemical Engineer can make 5 or 6 times more than a Psychologist not because it might be a more difficult job, but because there is a plethora of psychologists, and a scarce amount of Chemical Engineers. With the idea of supply and demand comes the fact that companies or businesses rely more on efficiency to meet the demand.

    "comment info": "The graph displayed depicts the career earnings for college graduates in specific areas of study. Firstly, the graph has two colors, light blue and dark blue, the dark blue representing the average earnings, and the light blue to represent the outliers, or the highest and lowest, in the pay scale. Another observation is that the careers that live in the areas of math and science tend to make more money over time than the careers based in the areas of literature, art, and critical thinking. This graph, while giving a good prediction of the earning, is flawed. It does not take into account the different factors that affect the earnings in some careers such as: level of education, working environment, passion for that field, inflation over time, the effect of government control over some careers like education, or criminal justice, and it does not take into account the different jobs that can be obtained with these different careers. While this graph gives a general overview of the earnings that can be obtained when following certain areas of study, it is not a good reference to choose a future career.",

I noticed that majority of the STEM related majors are given higher wages when compared to those with theoretical and literature based majors, which could be concerning because it also showed that education was one of the most low paid majors; everyone who has high wages were highly impacted by the education that they receive. All in all, I believe that Education should be one of the most rewarding in money. However, I am skeptical of this graph because the amount of people who are passionate within a field could change and the amount of money that goes into a certain field can be skewed over time because of it; there is also a high possibility that some of these majors will cease to exist in the future.",

    "comment info": "The graph represents the projected career earnings for college graduates based on their major. Although, the graph appears to be a credible source, the sheer fact that the data is a \u201cprojection\u201d implies that it could be incredibly inaccurate. The demand and funding for specific career options is constantly fluctuating and especially in the event of a severe economic crisis, specific earnings could plummet or skyrocket unexpectedly. Additionally, the graph can be misleading in the fact that the lowest and highest 10 percent of the projected career earnings are left off the chart. Therefore, if someone enters in the field expecting to make a certain amount, they may be unhappily surprised to realize they are in the lowest percentile and earning severely less than expected. Furthermore, low projections may discourage students from majoring in a field that may be best suited for them, and lose the opportunity to thrive at a job they excel at. I wonder what the reach of this graph is, and whether or not it will impact the decision of college students.",

    "comment info": "As I read the graph, I notice the placement of the career paths as well as the differences in amounts each career earns. For instance, Chemical Engineering graduates can earn up to almost 6 million dollars if successful where to Education graduates can earn up to about 3 million dollars. Different factors play into the wide range of earnings. Because most education and criminal justice majors tend to work for the government, earnings can be less compared to a computer science major who works for a company with a larger budget. The vast difference in earnings implies what careers are more popular in today\u2019s society as well as possibly persuading future graduate students to pick their majors according to earnings. However, the credibility of the graph is questioned as \u201cprojected career earnings\u201d can change in the future because of the unknown problems that can occur. Because of this, I wonder if future graduates do rely on such graphs when choosing the major they wish to study.",

As someone who is looking to major in psychology, I found it disheartening to find that it made a significant amount less than other majors. However, I hope that people will use the graph only for reference and not base their decisions for college on it. Passion is one of the most important factors in finding a major that it is a good fit for you. If I based my major off of how much money I could possibly make I would choose Chemical engineering, a major I have no interest in pursuing. I also found it odd that education, the basis of all of the majors listed makes the least amount of money.",

However, there is still a high level of overlap between even the highest earning major and the lowest. Therefore, it is still possible to earn more with a philosophy major rather than a chemistry major even though it may not be expected. Furthermore, I agree that choosing a major based on passion and interest rather that income is very important. A field of study that one enjoys is much more likely to lead to a better job opportunity than one that is not best suited for that person\u2019s talents or characteristics.",

I feel criminal justice studies take a lot more school and time compared to other paths, to be able to graduate efficiently and should have a higher paid or at least roughly the same percentile then a lot of careers. Criminal justice should be looked at as an important, very necessary job and showing how even their highest paid percentiles are still lower than most will discourage people from choosing that path as a career. There is an argument within this graph, it shows the difference in salary between the more common jobs versus the more unique. Education is the lowest paid job and chemical engineering is the highest. The difference of salary is extensive showing that education is not nearly as important as chemical engineering. A really good education is needed to be able to be successful in chemical engineering. Every career starts with education and their percentile is low that the career path of education will be looked at as inferior to something like chemical engineering. This is a problem in society as less people will go into the education path but more will expect an adequate education.",

These higher paying careers tend to be STEM-related and more practical than those located in the upper region of the graph. This may imply that, because these careers are more practical, they are in higher demand which is why they get paid more. I wonder why it is that the bars in the lower portion are larger and why the lengths of the darker blue vary among each career. This variation may be explained by the labels shown at the top and bottom of the graph; the lowest and highest percentiles indicate that the fields presented at the bottom have a wider range of earnings. The story this graph is telling is that there is an imbalance of pay among the different careers, despite most of them being almost equally important. For example, education is exceedingly necessary for the progression of our society and ensuring that the careers like those located towards the bottom are pursued and reached.",

This trend is likely caused by the fact that these careers are greatly demanded as of now. Society wants to progress rapidly and it needs many people in S.T.E.M. careers in order to accomplish this. While society\u2019s progression may justify the large salaries of S.T.E.M. careers, it does not justify the low salaries of those who graduate with a major in education and in criminal justice. People who have careers in education are highly responsible for progressing society as well, since they educate future generations. As a result, they deserve to have higher salaries than the graph indicates. Similarly, those who major in criminal justice are the people that ensure society remains ordered and safe. Without these justice workers, civilization would not be able to advance, so they also deserve higher wages than they receive at the moment. Because the government is usually responsible for paying the people in these careers, their low salaries indicate that the government is neglecting important workers that deserve higher pay.",

If less students pursue Education due to its low earnings, as of 2017, will that provoke higher earnings in the future?\nThe story this graph is telling me is that, in 2017, scientific and technological majors seem to be earning more money in their fields while other majors seem to be earning less while also highlighting the increased focus on STEM-based fields as more people may be inclined to pursue those jobs",

It utilizes a comparison between the medians of projected career earnings in different fields. However, the graph is not omniscient. It attempts to predict wages years into the future, which can be highly inaccurate. For example, the economics field is set as the second greatest money earner, yet if there were a horrific stock market collapse tomorrow, the economics would quickly fall down the ranks of top paying jobs. The graph is intended as a guide for students deciding on their major, yet it leaves itself vulnerable to unforeseen changes years in the future. Students should not use the graph as their sole source of advice when it comes to career choice, especially since they will leave college jobless and in desperate need of a way to pay off their debt. However, the graph does aid in revealing the current state of careers since it is based on recently updated information. It also has a more expansive amount of data available to viewers to inform them of the current job climate. It does have its uses, but it should not be viewed as the law of the land.",

I wonder to what year the chart is projected towards. I wonder what the total earnings constitutes\u2026 40 years of work? 50? I notice two different shades of blue- probably showcasing the extremes. Most of the higher-earning career majors are STEM majors. This graph may also not be accurate in the future. Jobs are constantly growing and declining to suit the needs of society. Society\u2019s needs often differ and flux as it progresses. For example, children that are a result of a baby boom are growing older and will need more hospital care, hence creating the need for more nurses, creating a high demand which generates higher salaries for nurses and doctors- higher than possibly could have been projected.

We have the mentality of looking towards STEM majors to fix our issues at hand or to enhance our lives. For the most part, we are disregarding the types of jobs that will help us address issues in our society as a whole.

We don\u2019t want to be examined or have our communities changed but rather we support industries that serve to enhance our day to day lives. New technology products help individuals better their lives whereas careers that produce thought and incite understanding have much less appeal to our increasingly materialistic world.

People usually choose a career based on how much money they will make. Who doesn't want to make a lot of money?

These branches of majors also require a more extensive route of education after completing the required undergraduate studies. These majors also tend to have a higher percentage in wages as illustrated on the graph, which can be implied that more college students gravitate toward careers that make the more money. I wonder if college students are majoring in what they are passionate about even if the career choice is not a promising one in the future. The more money these jobs make, the more people who will go to those jobs. I wonder what the different percentiles mean on the graph, and what they have to do with the statistics shown. Less people are moving toward theoretical jobs because in the long-run, those jobs do not make the amount of money that they desire. People are more drawn to the fact that they can make more money because they go toward the job or career that would make them the most of it o be able to have a sustainable living condition.",

I also observe that there is considerable variation within each profession and think that perhaps there is less (though still significant) variation between the professions. As a college student studying math and humanities, I found it comforting to observe that there is a lot of overlap - it might be less likely, but a philosophy major sometimes earns more than an economics major. \n\nI notice that nursing is far down (higher lifetime earnings) and that surprises me. I'd like to know more about who was counted as a nursing major and whether those students trained solely to be nurses or whether perhaps some were pre-med and went on to be doctors.\n\nThat brings me to my biggest point: thinking in terms of majors can be deceptive. English majors can become chemistry PhDs. Psychology majors can join PR firms. I've read that kids from wealthier backgrounds often have more freedom to do \"riskier\" humanities majors - some of them then end up in law or finance. Overall, I think this graph might be trying to tell a story about how choice of major can affect lifetime earnings, but I think there is a lot not said that my fellow students should consider. We need to remember that major does not dictate career path, and thus the graph does not necessarily reflect how much people actually working in the areas they majored in earn.",

People who work in criminal justice and education are the framers of society and should be deemed as more important. They often do hard work and have to deal with things that many people prefer not to deal with.

So for example, if there are 100,000 people looking for a jobs who have a degree in criminal justice, but there are only 50,000 jobs available, they will most likely be willing to have lower pay due to the scarcity in jobs; however in contrast, there are 20,000 jobs that require  an individual with a degree in chemical engineering, but only 10,000 individuals have a degree in chemical engineering.

Factors can include where they land the job, where they graduate from, the type of job they get at a certain major, if the person had family emergencies they had to tend to, or even if there were problems in the job market at a given time. For example, teachers that teach at a college campus obviously are going to be making more money then a teacher at an elementary school.",

We can also see how much the average, 10th, and 90th percentile earn. This graph gives us insight on majors that will be presented to us in College.

How much you make in a career isn\u2019t the only criteria for selecting a major, but did this graph change your thinking about your college major and future career?\n\nLots of questions came up from this graph.  You asked how the majors were selected, how projected earnings were calculated, and how many years is considered a lifetime.  You wondered about what the 10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentile means and why the blue segments are of different lengths.  But, most frequently, you noticed that education majors made less than STEM majors.  As O'BryantGirlNamedFallon from Boston wrote, \u201cWell, to me it seems like the teachers, who shape the future of our children, are not getting the money they deserve. I wonder, why should the teachers who help all these people reach their dreams, why should they get the lowest pay?\u201d \n\nSince we continue to post responses, is there more that you notice?  More that you wonder?  Talk to your classmates and read the moderators\u2019 responses. Maybe something they say will lead to more things you notice, wonder, and conjecture. \n\nCheck back on Thursday, January 11 to learn more about this graph.

The fact that the economics and nursing fields earn a higher lifetime earning than these other STEM fields is surprising. The general trend of this graph is that STEM fields have a higher pay. Hence, these two outliers are surprising. Also, I wonder where they got their data from and which people they surveyed. I feel that this matters because if they surveyed people in an industry from a low paying region as compared to a high-paying region, it would influence the data. Probably, the graph may be influencing people\u2019s career choice. People might follow the money, while there also are some people who will do what they love.

I think this wage gap has to do with the fact that there is a higher demand for STEM than English, for example, because we as a society are making further advancements in the field than other areas of study. The graph presents an important factor: the monetary value of teachers is much lower than other majors. It also omits many key factors, such as the amount time spent at a job and other necessary pieces of info, which is peculiar because this graph is supposed to show the future of careers. I can infer that the author wants the audience to focus on the salaries of these jobs, even though it completely defies the purpose of job, which is to do something that you feel can help contribute to the world.

A median, as well as a 10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentile, are plotted on the graph as they locate and quantize the range of projected salaries that populations within each field receive. The varying majors located on the left display a common trend, in that the majors related to science and economy gravitate towards the higher end of the spectrum while other jobs, namely government paid vocations, lean towards the lower end. There remains an outlier on the last major, chemical engineering, as their median as well as their range are noticeably higher than all other majors. As the title states how these earnings are for college graduates, it can be inferred that the graph is intended for students looking for different types of jobs and depicts the monetary incentive for each career type.

The median numbers increases as the list goes down and they usually lean towards the left of the blue. The higher earning figures tend to be in the S.T.E.M. field as compared to the others. Due to the growing demand of progress, those careers are often paid larger amounts for their work. The top earning S.T.E.M. majors seem to have more competition compared to wider fields such as philosophy and are harder to get a job in than the rest. Even though those fields are going to be useful in the future, we as a society need to appreciate other fields like Education and Social more. Those fields are just as important in lending a hand in progressing our society and they deserve a higher salary than they are getting currently. The graph does not tell the whole story, factors such as location, economy, if its a government or company job, and degree of difficulty effects how much a person makes during a career. The graph is likely to change in the future because of the changing economy we have today. If a majority in College chose Chemical Engineering due to this graph, the career earnings would go down drastically due to a drop in competition. I would not recommend this graph for choosing a career because of the factors that do not go into it.",

In the end, based on this graph students may choose one of these careers solely on money.  However, I wonder if this information is completely accurate for students in fours years who may have to decide their fields of study now.

Also, while the median career earning does increase from the top to bottom of the graph, the range between the 10th and 90th percentiles also generally increases. The greater dispersion of career earnings may be a result of many people wanting to go into higher paying careers. Greater competition would be generated, causing a wider spectrum in the amount of money people in the same career path can earn. Thus, job availability should be taken into consideration along with the projected earnings.

With more people applying for similar positions, companies can pay workers lower salaries. Another factor, besides supply and demand, is passion. What the graph fails to consider is that some college students choose a certain career path out of passion or love for a subject.

I had not really thought about what you had said about how with increasing popularity of certain STEM careers, eventually wages for these jobs may greatly decrease due to the large amount of people in that industry. Career incomes could change greatly in the future as we have no way to tell what will happen to certain jobs and the income they make. While a career may be in high demand right now, and therefore could have a high income, in the future the demand may die down and people might earn much less in that career, or the other way around.

In addition, most of the careers with median wages of $3 million or higher are STEM based, while careers with median wages that fall below $3M are based primarily on sociology, language, history, or the arts. I wonder if such discrepancy between career types is due to a higher demand for workers in scientific and mathematical fields, than others that fall outside of STEM. Although there are exceptions to this rule, the general pattern of the graph supports the idea that the economy favors STEM based careers. In my opinion, the graph seems to advise college students deciding on a major to enter these fields, using solely money as a motivation. I personally disagree with the notion that one should reconsider their major based on earnings alone because these statistics are subject to change and if one has no business in chemical engineering, then they should not enter such a career they are not adept at, nor take interest, in for the pay.

Even though Chemical Engineering can be considered as a much more difficult job than Psychology, it all depends on if the place where they live really needs a Psychologist or a Chemical Engineer. So for this reason, when looking at the 75th to 90th percentile I see that the Chemical Engineer can make 5 or 6 times more than a Psychologist not because it might be a more difficult job, but because there is a plethora of psychologists, and a scarce amount of Chemical Engineers. With the idea of supply and demand comes the fact that companies or businesses rely more on efficiency to meet the demand.

    "comment info": "This graph argues for which careers college students should follow in order to earn the most money over their lifetime. Douglas Webber analyzes the benefits of different careers from an economic standpoint, demonstrating which career college graduates can ultimately gain the most wealth from. Webber contends that money should be the greatest influence in one\u2019s career choice through his indirect support of students choosing careers which will give them the greatest wealth over factors such as passion or interest. His graph may also give inaccurate results as he is simply speculating over the amount of money people could make in their lifetime in a career, as demand could rise or fall, leading to an increase of decrease in income made. He also demonstrates a bias by his favoring of mainly STEM majors as careers with the highest earnings. Surely, there are many other careers which earn large sums of money and are not STEM, and by not including these majors, he attempts to persuade the observer to choose STEM careers in order earn the most wealth.",

    "comment info": "The graph displayed depicts the career earnings for college graduates in specific areas of study. Firstly, the graph has two colors, light blue and dark blue, the dark blue representing the average earnings, and the light blue to represent the outliers, or the highest and lowest, in the pay scale. Another observation is that the careers that live in the areas of math and science tend to make more money over time than the careers based in the areas of literature, art, and critical thinking. This graph, while giving a good prediction of the earning, is flawed. It does not take into account the different factors that affect the earnings in some careers such as: level of education, working environment, passion for that field, inflation over time, the effect of government control over some careers like education, or criminal justice, and it does not take into account the different jobs that can be obtained with these different careers. While this graph gives a general overview of the earnings that can be obtained when following certain areas of study, it is not a good reference to choose a future career.",

I noticed that majority of the STEM related majors are given higher wages when compared to those with theoretical and literature based majors, which could be concerning because it also showed that education was one of the most low paid majors; everyone who has high wages were highly impacted by the education that they receive. All in all, I believe that Education should be one of the most rewarding in money. However, I am skeptical of this graph because the amount of people who are passionate within a field could change and the amount of money that goes into a certain field can be skewed over time because of it; there is also a high possibility that some of these majors will cease to exist in the future.",

Although, the graph appears to be a credible source, the sheer fact that the data is a \u201cprojection\u201d implies that it could be incredibly inaccurate. The demand and funding for specific career options is constantly fluctuating and especially in the event of a severe economic crisis, specific earnings could plummet or skyrocket unexpectedly. Additionally, the graph can be misleading in the fact that the lowest and highest 10 percent of the projected career earnings are left off the chart. Therefore, if someone enters in the field expecting to make a certain amount, they may be unhappily surprised to realize they are in the lowest percentile and earning severely less than expected. Furthermore, low projections may discourage students from majoring in a field that may be best suited for them, and lose the opportunity to thrive at a job they excel at. I wonder what the reach of this graph is, and whether or not it will impact the decision of college students.",

For instance, Chemical Engineering graduates can earn up to almost 6 million dollars if successful where to Education graduates can earn up to about 3 million dollars. Different factors play into the wide range of earnings. Because most education and criminal justice majors tend to work for the government, earnings can be less compared to a computer science major who works for a company with a larger budget. The vast difference in earnings implies what careers are more popular in today\u2019s society as well as possibly persuading future graduate students to pick their majors according to earnings. However, the credibility of the graph is questioned as \u201cprojected career earnings\u201d can change in the future because of the unknown problems that can occur.

I feel criminal justice studies take a lot more school and time compared to other paths, to be able to graduate efficiently and should have a higher paid or at least roughly the same percentile then a lot of careers. Criminal justice should be looked at as an important, very necessary job and showing how even their highest paid percentiles are still lower than most will discourage people from choosing that path as a career. There is an argument within this graph, it shows the difference in salary between the more common jobs versus the more unique. Education is the lowest paid job and chemical engineering is the highest. The difference of salary is extensive showing that education is not nearly as important as chemical engineering. A really good education is needed to be able to be successful in chemical engineering. Every career starts with education and their percentile is low that the career path of education will be looked at as inferior to something like chemical engineering. This is a problem in society as less people will go into the education path but more will expect an adequate education.",

These higher paying careers tend to be STEM-related and more practical than those located in the upper region of the graph. This may imply that, because these careers are more practical, they are in higher demand which is why they get paid more. I wonder why it is that the bars in the lower portion are larger and why the lengths of the darker blue vary among each career. This variation may be explained by the labels shown at the top and bottom of the graph; the lowest and highest percentiles indicate that the fields presented at the bottom have a wider range of earnings.

This trend is likely caused by the fact that these careers are greatly demanded as of now. Society wants to progress rapidly and it needs many people in S.T.E.M. careers in order to accomplish this. While society\u2019s progression may justify the large salaries of S.T.E.M. careers, it does not justify the low salaries of those who graduate with a major in education and in criminal justice. People who have careers in education are highly responsible for progressing society as well, since they educate future generations. As a result, they deserve to have higher salaries than the graph indicates. Similarly, those who major in criminal justice are the people that ensure society remains ordered and safe. Without these justice workers, civilization would not be able to advance, so they also deserve higher wages than they receive at the moment. Because the government is usually responsible for paying the people in these careers, their low salaries indicate that the government is neglecting important workers that deserve higher pay.",

The graph is intended as a guide for students deciding on their major, yet it leaves itself vulnerable to unforeseen changes years in the future. Students should not use the graph as their sole source of advice when it comes to career choice, especially since they will leave college jobless and in desperate need of a way to pay off their debt. However, the graph does aid in revealing the current state of careers since it is based on recently updated information.

Society\u2019s needs often differ and flux as it progresses.

This shows that a career in STEM that is much harder to achieve pays the most, indicating the idea that if people want to earn the most money, then they must be willing to dedicate their time and effort into pursuing their goal.",

Also, this graph is only possible if records of current college students are being used. For example, the graph is able to project earnings estimated from college students graduating, and actually pursuing their careers, meaning that certain majors are impacted than others. Although some of the information shown may not add up, I do agree with what the graph has to say when referring to certain careers being needed than others.",

These branches of majors also require a more extensive route of education after completing the required undergraduate studies. These majors also tend to have a higher percentage in wages as illustrated on the graph, which can be implied that more college students gravitate toward careers that make the more money. I wonder if college students are majoring in what they are passionate about even if the career choice is not a promising one in the future. The more money these jobs make, the more people who will go to those jobs. I wonder what the different percentiles mean on the graph, and what they have to do with the statistics shown. Less people are moving toward theoretical jobs because in the long-run, those jobs do not make the amount of money that they desire. People are more drawn to the fact that they can make more money because they go toward the job or career that would make them the most of it o be able to have a sustainable living condition.",

Also there are careers where the median pay is more an individual make in their whole lives. An example is education and social working as compared to Accounting and Math and Statistics.

I also observe that there is considerable variation within each profession and think that perhaps there is less (though still significant) variation between the professions. As a college student studying math and humanities, I found it comforting to observe that there is a lot of overlap - it might be less likely, but a philosophy major sometimes earns more than an economics major. \n\nI notice that nursing is far down (higher lifetime earnings) and that surprises me. I'd like to know more about who was counted as a nursing major and whether those students trained solely to be nurses or whether perhaps some were pre-med and went on to be doctors.\n\nThat brings me to my biggest point: thinking in terms of majors can be deceptive. English majors can become chemistry PhDs. Psychology majors can join PR firms. I've read that kids from wealthier backgrounds often have more freedom to do \"riskier\" humanities majors - some of them then end up in law or finance. Overall, I think this graph might be trying to tell a story about how choice of major can affect lifetime earnings, but I think there is a lot not said that my fellow students should consider. We need to remember that major does not dictate career path, and thus the graph does not necessarily reflect how much people actually working in the areas they majored in earn.",

People who work in criminal justice and education are the framers of society and should be deemed as more important. They often do hard work and have to deal with things that many people prefer not to deal with.

So for example, if there are 100,000 people looking for a jobs who have a degree in criminal justice, but there are only 50,000 jobs available, they will most likely be willing to have lower pay due to the scarcity in jobs; however in contrast, there are 20,000 jobs that require  an individual with a degree in chemical engineering, but only 10,000 individuals have a degree in chemical engineering. These individuals are evidently more qualified and have the advantage of determining the amount of salary they are paid.

I believe this all has to do with the person because we are all different and we all have different strengths and weaknesses.",

How much you make in a career isn\u2019t the only criteria for selecting a major, but did this graph change your thinking about your college major and future career?\n\nLots of questions came up from this graph.  You asked how the majors were selected, how projected earnings were calculated, and how many years is considered a lifetime.  You wondered about what the 10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentile means and why the blue segments are of different lengths.  But, most frequently, you noticed that education majors made less than STEM majors.  As O'BryantGirlNamedFallon from Boston wrote, \u201cWell, to me it seems like the teachers, who shape the future of our children, are not getting the money they deserve. I wonder, why should the teachers who help all these people reach their dreams, why should they get the lowest pay?\u201d \n\nSince we continue to post responses, is there more that you notice?  More that you wonder?  Talk to your classmates and read the moderators\u2019 responses. Maybe something they say will lead to more things you notice, wonder, and conjecture. \n\nCheck back on Thursday, January 11 to learn more about this graph.

The story this graph if telling is that most careers in math and science make more money than jobs in education or the humanities.

The fact that the economics and nursing fields earn a higher lifetime earning than these other STEM fields is surprising. The general trend of this graph is that STEM fields have a higher pay. Hence, these two outliers are surprising. Also, I wonder where they got their data from and which people they surveyed. I feel that this matters because if they surveyed people in an industry from a low paying region as compared to a high-paying region, it would influence the data. Probably, the graph may be influencing people\u2019s career choice. People might follow the money, while there also are some people who will do what they love. However, the graph may imply a shift towards the STEM fields because of it being a higher-paying career.",

Both of these percentiles share the same shade of light blue, which causes the eyes to divert from the darker blue colored median range. In most cases, the median itself is larger than the 75th to 90th percentile even though it appears differently at a glance.This can be very misleading, as I first assumed that greater earnings were more common. As a high school student, this graph is extremely beneficial. This is because college is only a few years away and it is important to see how the major I choose can set me up for a comfortable life. While helpful, I also wonder where this information was collected and how many people currently occupy these occupations. Is there a higher demand for certain jobs? Are there any significant outliers that aren't shown on this graph?",

It is outrageous that educators in the United States of America get paid less than philosophers. They are absolutely critical to the education of the next generation. If talented educators leave to get paid more in the private sector, the next generation of Chemical Engineers and other high-paid careers will be far less able. A good educator can truly inspire their students, and it must be difficult for a good educator to fully focus on their job, if they are worrying about making rent or paying for their children\u2019s college education. If this situation does not change in the next few years, I fully expect teacher strikes to emerge, and I will gladly join them.",

I believe that people in education should have a higher median income because the education of youth would help countries thrive. Youth are the literal future of America. I wonder why education has the lowest median income. I believe that the graph is skewed in the way that Education and other important subjects should have higher incomes.",

It also shows something that has been known for a long time, chemical engineers are really well paid. It betrays the simple fact that civil servants (specifically teachers) are systematically screwed and underpaid. It is a travesty that they are so underpaid, and our nation will experience a massive brain drain if we don't give a reason for people to become teachers, by not systematically underpaying them. We need to end this, there is no other option.",
