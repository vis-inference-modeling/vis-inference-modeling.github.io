From the 1901-1930 graph, precipitation seems to have a concentration in the southwest plains area of the US. The overall least amount of precipitation seems to occur in the 1931-1960 graph. Then in the 1961-1990 graph, the occurrence of precipitation is wide spread, but not in high concentration. However, the 1991-2021 graph shows high concentration of precipitation in the Northwest and Midwest - this being the largest span covered so far. I wonder if this increase of precipitation has something to do with factors such as climate change, or the occurrence of natural disasters such as tornadoes or hurricanes due to geographical location. This increase relates to me and my community because I live in the Northeast's high concentration. This could be harmful to habitats and organisms but also increase the viability of certain organisms.

During the time of 1931-1960, I noticed that there is the least amount of precipitation shown in the graph than there is in any other time period. The precipitation in 1901-1930 and 1961-1990, is more equally distributed in the areas rather than one heavier than the other. I wonder why some areas receive more precipitation in comparison to others and why precipitation has increased so much during the more current years. This relates to me and my community because in the more recent times, precipitation has been heavy in the northeast, which is where I live. This increase in precipitation can be harmful to some organisms by destroying their habitats or causing them to make changes to their lifestyles. It can also be beneficial because it reduces the amount of droughts and water shortages. The graph shows the amount of precipitation across America from 1901-2020, distributed by 30 year increments.

I also noticed that in the most recent observed time period, the precipitation in the northeastern states is the most extreme it has ever been since being observed. After looking through the graph and information, I now wonder why the precipitation has had such extreme measures in the past few years and if there are any factors that may have caused it to be that way. These graphs relate to my location; I live in the northeast and I have observed in my past 16 years of living here that a lot of rain has been the standard weather for spring and fall months especially. This drastic change of precipitation has the ability to increase biodiversity in my area and in the northeast as a whole, which can be beneficial.

I immediately noticed that the precipitation started off more concentrated in the western side of the US (1901-1930), but in the most recent 30-year period (1991-2020), the precipitation is more heavily concentrated in the eastern part of the US. The amount of precipitation also increased over time, which I would assume has some correlation to global warming.\n2. I wonder why the majority of the precipitation shifted to the eastern side, as opposed to the amount of precipitation increasing altogether (on both sides of the US). However, this may be due to the increased amount of snowfall on the east coast, specifically in the northeast.\n3. As someone who lives on the east coast, we are directly affected by the increase in precipitation on this side of the country.

I wonder why that is the case. It was much dryer, and there was less rainfall in 1931 then there was in years past, and years afterwards, Why during that time was it so much dryer?\n3.

But in the 1931-1960 graft it has low precipitation levels this reflects the time during the dust bowl where it was a big time for droughts. I think the rising levels of precipitation nation wide is because of global warming. Since the Earth is warming at a faster rate water is evaporating quicker thus causing more formations of water particles in the air leading to massive down pour. This causing flooding in communities that destroys homes, stopping travel/trade, etc\u2026",

During 1901-1930, I was surprised to see that the western half of the US had the most precipitation.

In 1961-1990, it appears that the US had completely recovered from the dust bowl. In 1991-2020, the precipitation increased drastically across the US.

However, in the most recent graph, the majority of the country is covered in either extreme precipitation or, at the opposite end of the spectrum, extreme drought. Here in Arizona, we're having a bit of water trouble when it comes to rivers. Since cities are expanding, they're requiring more water. The farmers near the city need the water to grow crops, though. The question of who requires water rights is become quite a problem. The increasing amount of water-related issues is rising, which is also depicted in the graph.

In the first graph which shows the first 30 years, the precipitation levels were very different amounts in different hemispheres of the country. During this time also occurred the industrial revolution. Many pollutants were being released and this could've contributed to the weather being off from usual. Next in the 1930s to the 1960s that appeared to be a very dry couple of years. I do not know the exact reason behind this but I can assume that the pollutants had something to do with it. 1960-1990 there was a huge increase in precipitation levels. I wonder if this can be attributed to the newfound environmentalists, or even just simple climate change. The rain continued in this manner and in the latest graph the rain is the heaviest amounts found. This can also be said to just be plain climate change, for the climate does change.

During the early and mid-1900s, the precipitation levels were very different throughout the country. The US was booming with new industries and machines that had a big impact on the climate and precipitation. I also noticed that in the 1930s to 1960s there was a huge drought in the West and that was because in the 1930s the Dust Bowl took place. The Dust Bowl was an awful drought that hit the southern plains region and it lasted for almost a decade so that had a huge effect on the climate and the precipitation levels. In the 1960s to 1990s, there was a huge increase in precipitation and I wonder why there was such a big increase because the previous sixty years before some regions did not nearly experience that much rain. My thoughts are that the climate started to warm up and that caused a lot more precipitation. During the last thirty years, there has been a huge increase in rain and that is most likely because climate change has taken a huge toll on the earth all around. What I have noticed is that through the 20th century to the 21st century, the precipitation levels have been very different in all regions of the US. This relates to my community in many ways but mostly because we have been receiving a lot of rain in recent years.

As time goes and the years pass by precipitation levels in the west start to decrease as the east starts to increase precipitation levels. In the years, 1931-1960, however, there seems to be little to no precipitation. This reminds me of the Dust Bowl in 1930 when the southwest suffered a severe drought. I wonder why over the years the location and amount or precipitation have varied. This could be because of climate change or pollution in the atmosphere. In the years 1991-2020, almost the entire east and part of the western part of the United States experiences 9+ inches of precipitation. I think this graph is to show people the changes over the years of precipitation levels across the country and maybe to prove a point.

Many farmers as of 2019, haven't been successful with their crops and some blame climate change. Climate change can affect the intensity and frequency of precipitation. In areas where precipitation is abundant, I wonder how it effects their daily lives. Thinking more urban, are cities and homes being flooded? Is transportation affected in these cities? In my area, we always have flash floods, people who play outdoor sports for schools practices are canceled. Atlanta being one of the cities that has a high employment rate, many people come here.

Another major change is in the 1931 to 1960 map where precipitation in the heartland decreased significantly from the thirty years prior. I wonder why precipitation had a major increase over the last thirty years, and why the rain slowly shift to the East side of the country? My second question connects to a point I made earlier, why did precipitation decline the most in the years 1931 to 1960? In the graphs, I think that precipitation increased more in the East rather than the West because of the colder, wetter weather that is more common on the East Coast. In the years 1931 to 1960, rain might've lessened because of the absence of available moisture in the atmosphere. I can connect these chloropleths to myself as well as my community because I live in New Jersey, on the East Coast. I am personally affected by the precipitation throughout the country, and even more specifically in town, for my school sports, outside events throughout the year, and storms that affect my surrounding area.

I also notices that the second and fourth graph are almost opposites of each other. One graph shows the United States with majority of orange/ negative values does this indicate a drought? I am curious to see how climate change has affected these graphs and what scientists predict the next graph might look like.  I did notice that in the last graph the midwest/eastcoast states have been getting more precipitation which makes sense because of the recent hurricanes and floods in the past decade in those areas. An impact this has on me and my community is to conserve water, we live in California where droughts are common and fires have their own season, we need the precipitation to keep our forests green.

I also have thoughts on whether Arizona is going to suffer lots of negative impacts due to draught and hot climate, for example, a lot of energy waste because of all the AC's that are probably going to be on daily use.

I find this interesting because the areas that look like they increased in 2020 are along the coast meaning the oceans could be getting warmer leading to more evaporation along the coast. In the years 1931-1960 the dust bowl took over much of the west leaving states in extreme drought around 80 years later it looks like the perception has flipped, leaving the US with high amounts of rainfall\nWhat is this change due to? A lot of scientists refer to climate change as a major problem in our world due to the carbon dioxide breaking down the ozone layer and I am wondering how much has to do with climate change and how much has to do with other factors.

The graph says that precipitation levels have risen over 9% in the majority of the U.S. While I don\u2019t know the exact reason for this gradual increase, I can infer that it is due to climate change and the melting of glaciers. The melting of glaciers causes an abundance of fresh water to be available for evaporation. \n        This is very concerning because if there is more water available and more precipitation, this can cause sea levels to rise therefore putting our future generations in danger.

As well as this, I notice that there were negative precipitation levels over the years. \n2. What do you wonder?\nI wonder why the precipitation levels have increased over the past few decades. I also wonder why there were negative precipitation levels. Lastly, I wonder why this data was recorded and why it was used for. \n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nThe impact that this has on me and my community is that I live in Massachusetts and in 1901, the precipitation levels were negative versus now, they are exponentially higher. This also affects my community because I have noticed that it has been raining a lot and this affects some of the activities that you can do, especially during the summer months. \n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\nIn this graph, the precipitation levels from 1901-2020 were recorded and compared to one another. This data was collected from thousands of weather stations and these chloroplasts reflect this data. A catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea would be \u201cHow will the United States precipitation levels change in the future?\u201d",

Similarly, the first and second appear to lean towards negative rates of precipitation relative to the 20th century average on average, whereas the third and fourth appear to trend to positive rates of precipitation relative to the 20th century average.\n\n- I wonder what it would look like if the graphs were separated into decade groups instead of tri-decade groups. I suspect it would lend itself to a far more useful display of data, given that the few data points known, the less evidence there is towards a legitimate correlation between variables.\n\n- This mostly is relevant to my specific community because it is the most massively negative area relative to the 20th century average. Water is, obviously, necessary to survival, and precipitation can generally be purified, and thus useful for survival.\n\n- The graph is displaying the relative rates of precipitation over four 30-year periods compared to the 20th century average rate of precipitation. \"Make it Rain: Precipitation changes over the last 120 years and what it means\"",
