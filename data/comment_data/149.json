Clean air is an important goal but comes at a cost to glonbal temps. We are seeing the impact of reduction in shipping aerosol emissions righ now which is adding to warming. \n\nIn addition, post 2007 warming is driven by the growth of the fraxcking industry with huge unregulated release of methane which warms the planet at up to 100 times the rate of CO2 over ten years. Whilst it is a short lived GHG its massive short term impacts have am knock on effect in driving feedback warming through relase of CO2 and Methane from metling ice and thawing tundra. \nThis is often ignored by claimte science as they model Methane direct impoacts over 100 years and almost totally ignore it massive feedback impacts. The focus on CO2 levels ahs always been niave, the modeeling of methan over 100 years is naive. \nWe need to reduce ,methane emisions rapidily, and CO2 should not be the focus. Unfortunately, climate science has put too much focus on CO2 for 50 years ignoring So2 and methane. Its time they started to get serious. \n\nCutting CO2 will have minimal short term impact.",

Our Perth Amboy and New Jersey communities are no strangers to industrial emissions that pollute the sky.\n\n4) Climate Change and the Earth: An Unhealthy Relationship",

The worldwide average temperature fluctuated from then on until 1980, as indicated by the huge bars, when there was a significant increase. The maximum temperature appears to have peaked around the year 2020, and the hottest temperature ever recorded was in 2022, the most recent year with data available.\n2. I wonder if, as a result of World War 2, the temperature abruptly rose significantly in 1940, perhaps as a result of mass production.\u00a0Additionally, I ponder whether bombings like the one in Hiroshima were a factor in the increase in global temperatures. Considering how much fuel they consume and how high they fly, I too wonder if airplanes had anything to do with it.\n3.

It fluctuated from then on until 1980 when there was a large spike in the global average temperature as shown by the large bars. The highest temperature seems to have peaked around the year 2020 and the most recent bar being 2022 is also one of the highest temperatures recorded. \n\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why the global average temperature began to change from negative degrees to positive degrees around 1940 and why it began fluctuating from then, and then ultimately leading to a large spike in the temperature beginning around 1980. Was it a cause of advancements in industry around the world or something else?

However, the average temperature since 1980 is +0.25 degrees C or higher. I wonder what is causing the temperature increase? Is it the increased use of fossil fuels? I also wonder if it is certain areas getting hotter and affecting the average temperature or the entire globe collectively getting warmer. This affects me because in my area it is getting warmer in the winter months every year and this can be seen by the lack of snow my area is getting. In the past, there had been countless major snowstorms, but this year it has snowed twice and the snow was gone by the next day. \"Climate is Changing as Time is Ticking\"",

Therefore, this is the year used for the baseline of the temperature comparisons. Prior to 1950, there were much lower temperatures. However, I observe that this trend began to change in 1940. This may be a result of the increased use of petroleum as a result of the second industrial revolution in 1917. Beginning in 1980, there had been a gradual increase in temperature every year.

There is a slight rise in temperature in the early 1940s  with an increasing temperature of .25\u00b0 C. This was the first increase in temperature since 1880, as the temperature remained under -.25\u00b0C for almost 60 years. The year of 2020, the temperature was at it highest, over .89\u00b0 C. \nI wonder what caused the increase in temperature in the year of 1940? Why has there been such a dramatic jump in temperature since 1980? \nThis relates to me and my community because throughout this warm winter it is apparent the change in temperature throughout the past few years.

The blue represents a decrease in temperatures while the orange represents an increase in temperature. The dark orange represents the sharp increase in temperature that has occurred in recent years.\n\nThe drastic changes in the temperatures were caused by climate change. I wonder what happened in the years leading up to 2022 that caused such a sharp increase in temperature. I also wonder why there is so much fluctuation in temperature around 1950. \n\n1950 was the first year that CO2 readings occurred. Therefore, this is the year used for the baseline of the temperature comparisons. Prior to 1950 there were much lower temperatures. However, I observe that this trend began to change in 1940. This may a result of the increased use of petroleum as a result of the second industrial revolution in 1917. Beginning in 1980, there had been a gradual increase in temperature every year. This was when climate change was beginning to be recognized as an issue.\n\nThis effects me and my community because the rising temperatures of climate change are already being felt. For instance, in recent years there has been a significant increase in wildfires and natural disasters.\n\nHeadline: \"Temperatures On The Rise\"",

This change in temperature and the weather could be contributed to the gradual increase in temperature over the past few decades. There could be many reasons for this increase (new technology, unsustainable industry, etc.), but no matter the reason, there has definitely been a noticeable increase in temperature and lack of colder weather conditions (snow, ice, etc.). \n Title: \n- \"The World's Rising Temperature\"",

The main thing that stands out is how there has been an increase in temperatures starting around 1980.  However, in the past few years, temperatures have increased sharply.  It is quite interesting how in the late 1800s and early 1900s, temperatures were much colder.  I wonder what the main cause of these changes is.  It most likely directly connects to climate change as temperatures are noticeably warmer in comparison to 100 years ago.  This relates to me and my community because it is important to note these climate changes so that people can respond properly.  Changing temperatures can cause disruptions to various aspects of daily life such as agriculture and weather patterns.  I would entitle this graph: \"Hot and Cold.\"",

    "comment info": "1) I note that temperatures were substantially lower in the nineteenth and twentieth century; there was a short temperature spike in the 1940's where the temperature transitioned from extremely cold to significantly warmer than typical. There was a 0.25-degrees Celsius rise around 1965, 1980 and 2000. Around 2020, the temperature rises, but it turns a deeper orange, suggesting that the rise and temperature is much stronger than previously. \n\n2) I'm curious if the major reason of temperature rise is the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Did the worldwide average rise as a result of pollution and excessive fuel consumption in automobiles? \n\n3) This relates to me and my community because global warming has been a recurring topic for many years but has become a larger concern currently. Many environments and areas around the world are suffering due to the climate change that has affected agriculture. Extreme temperatures can disrupt crop growth and reduce yields. Heatwaves also endanger livestock, both directly through potentially deadly heat stress and indirectly through reductions in fertility, milk production, and disease resistance. Droughts will further deplete soils that have already been exhausted by industrial farming practices, endangering not just food crops but also animal feed crops, pastures, and the animals that rely on them. \n\n4) As Global Temperature Rise Drastically, what is at Stake and When Will the World Take Action?",

This makes sense, as that pre-1940 period was not included in the calculations to find the global temperature referral point. The years which were used to find the referral line (global temperature average) had temperature's that fluctuated quite a bit, so they formed the relatively stable-ish years and were a transition from the colder pre 1940 temperatures to the warmer post 1981 years. While both domains were two ends of the warm-cool spectrum, the warmer years had temperatures that increased more rapidly than the preceding colder time period. \nWhy are there these marked cold and hot periods in time? What caused the fluctuations between the years 1941 and 1980? What is the impact of each increasing Celsius degree? What caused the temperature growth after the 1981s? Would the increasing warmth melt ice, and what would that do to the animals that live near the poles?\nThere have been a few storms recently in the area, but how is global warming going to affect weather? Will big storms become commonplace in some areas and in others extreme drought? What preparations will need to be taken?

Maybe start with looking at population and the economy.  And, then think about how these trends have progressed.",

The weather then fluctuated between hot and cold until the mid-1900s, when it began to rise dramatically above 25 degrees Celsius. This will continue until the global temperature reaches 0.89 degrees Celsius between the years 2000 and 2020.\n\n2. I'm curious about what caused the temperature to fluctuate so much in the mid-twentieth century. Was this due to an increase in the industrial revolution and mass production, or was it due to country consumerism and new and more advanced trade routes? What was the tipping point that caused the weather to rise above average?\n\n3. This is relevant to my community because, as someone who comes from a low-income neighborhood compared to many other Americans, I am aware that the negative effects of climate change can cause disaster in neighborhoods like mine before they reach more affluent families.\n\n4. \"THE STAIRS TO HELL'S HEAT GO UP\"",

I wonder if the rising temperature is due to global warming, and fossil fuels. I'm pretty sure it is because climate change is making the world's weather less predictable and hotter. For example, icebergs are melting at record rates, which relates to the average temperature getting hotter and hotter.  \n3. This relates to us because it means the average temperate is getting hotter, which is already a problem for places with severe droughts.
