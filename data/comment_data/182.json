I also noticed that the increase in price was greater when you took into account different sizes for all of the goods. \nI wonder why the price increase is different for different sizes of each good as I assume that the percentage increase would be the same proportionally since it's the same product. I also wonder why there has been such rampant inflation the last few years, as at normal inflation rates these prices should have increased around 7-12% which is drastically different from the over 30% increases for some products. \nPrices on almost everything have been greatly inflated the last few years and this has had a great detrimental effect on many people in my community. Many people live paycheck to paycheck and with this large increase in prices without a corresponding increase in pay is a problem. Many people are now choosing between food and gas or other essential products for them to live their lives.

The average inflation rate is normally expected to be around 2%. Over the course of 4 years, that should be around 8%. This is double that.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nWhat caused the inflation rate to become so high? The obvious one, Covid, could be a factor. After research, the inflation rate was only 1.4% in 2020. The next big change was in the presidency. I am not blaming Biden, but these large inflation rates happened at the beginning of his presidency and have persisted through his term.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis affects prices in stores around me, making me spend more for the same commodities I enjoyed for a few dollars cheaper 5 years ago. It has made the cost of living rise significantly, causing many to struggle to keep up with everything.\n\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\nGrocery trips beginning to cost as much as tropical trips!",

The graph shows how much more expensive items were at the end of 2023 as compared to the beginning of 2019. A lot of this price change is due to the COVID-19 pandemic which led to a lot of scarcity and overshopping from people across the globe. I think an important piece of evidence to support this is the most inflated item is household paper items, the things that were most in demand during the pandemic (toilet paper, paper towels, tissues, etc). I think this graph is focused on the United States because its source is the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a US government branch. I also was interested in the accounting for size portion of this graph, because my family and I always notice how products seem to be getting smaller while prices stay the same, or even grow.

This leads me to believe that coffee portions have not been massively shrunk and have not gone drastically up in price. I wonder if the inflation of household paper product costs is a product of Covid-19.

The graph also shows the price difference when accounting for size. One thing that we wonder is what brands this poll decided to use in their research. Another thing that we wonder is if they went to different stores to compare prices between each store. The last thing we wonder is how other products that weren't tested were affected by inflation.

I noticed that the product that had the greatest increase in price was household paper products between a 30%-35% increase. I also noticed that household paper products had the greatest difference in price change when comparing the increase when not accounting for size and accounting for size. I wonder if this difference is because more people buy household paper products in bulk so the price would be significantly higher when accounting for size than not. However, I noticed that coffee has the smallest increase in price at only about 20%-23% and also the smallest difference between the price increase when accounting for size and not accounting for size. Compared to household paper products, I think that there is a smaller disparity between price increases because people are less likely to buy coffee in bulk, so it does not make as much of a difference in price increase whether the size is accounted for or not. Overall, there is a trend of price increases for each object, representing inflation, and I wonder if since the data is from 2019-2023 if this inflation is a result of the COVID pandemic.

The graph illustrates the price increase when accounting for size and when not accounting for size. Given that the data represents the price increase from January 2019 to October 2023, I wonder how the Covid-19 pandemic affected these price increases, as there was a very high demand for cleaning products and household paper products given the need to disinfect to stop the spread, and the prolonged time at home calling for more home products. I wonder if wages have increased for those manufacturing these goods, and if so if that contributes to the price change.

Household paper products also had the greatest disparity in prices not accounting for size compared to accounting for size. On the other hand, coffee possesses the least inflated price after the 4 years at slightly more than 20%. While some products had a lower increase in price, the range from a 20% to 35% raise in price is still significant and indicates the high rate of inflation. In the future, the prices will most likely continue to rise with moderate inflation controlled by the Federal Reserve. I wonder why the specific objects in the graph were included in the graph?

It shows the change in price accounting for size and not accounting for size. I notice that the price of every product on this graph has gone up more than 20% since 2019 with or without accounting for weight. I can conclude this is likely due to rising inflation. The price of household paper products, when accounting for size, increased the most since 2019 (35%). At first, I thought this was just because of COVID and the scramble to buy toilet paper. However, according to the internet, this is due to a decline in the wood pulp which is a key ingredient used to make paper. When the demand is high and the supply is low, it is inevitable for prices to go up. Although coffee has increased the least in price out of all the products listed, the price has still increased significantly and it is noticeable. I constantly hear my dad complaining about coffee prices. Additionally, the price of snacks and candy at my school has gone up 50 cents in this past year. This makes me less likely to want to buy snacks from school because I would rather save my money and not buy expensive snacks/candy. I wonder if this is true for the global market. Are sales of these items declining because of how inflated the prices are? \n\"Is Your Starbucks Drink Over $8? Here's why...\"",

Items that used to be simple and easy to get are now up to almost 35% from what it once was. What I wonder is how the increase of prices has effected the amount of people who buy the products and if it has created a drawback in sales. Maybe people who were once originally buying a coffee everyday or getting snacks for their kids for lunch, are now decreasing their expenditures and how often they buy these products. What's going on in this graph is it is attempting to convey how much inflation is effecting everyday items people purchase and how covid has truly changed it. Some of these are not absolutely necessary but items people wouldn't even think twice about buying are now making people change their minds. Many people bought paper products during covid and the high demand affected its prices dramatically. This effects my community because my family tends to buy all of these items every time we go to the store and even my parents have helped me to realize the important thought process of cutting back on using paper products, such as paper towels, and not being wasteful, so we're not buying these products every other day.\nHeadline: Money: Is there a way for it to start growing on trees?",

Household paper products, when accounting for size, have the largest increase on this graph with a surge of 35%.

What stuck out to me the most is that candy and gum, when accounting for size, have an almost 30% increase as compared to cleaning products with less than a 25% increase. I wonder why candy increased more than other products. I wonder what this graph would look like if more items. For example, if meats, bread, and dairy were accounted for. Would they have price increases too? I also wonder if this graph would be affected by data from November 2023 to now. Would there be any significant changes?

It is evident that paper products had the highest jump, with food and cleaning products using paper having the highest. I wonder why paper has had such an inflation in price. It is one of the most used products, so it is both interesting and worrying that it would be so much more expensive.

This affects every community because of how important paper is to standard life. Not only paper products, but food packaging and household products use paper.

For instance, it appears that paper products pricing has increased a significant amount compared to coffee, however, it's just a 15% difference. I found it intriguing how each item on the graph is represented by two distinct points, highlighting how variations in size can produce a noticeable change in outcome. \nI wonder why the Bureau of Labor Statistics chose to compare these five distinct grocery items. Did they anticipate that the change in coffee prices would be an interesting point of comparison with the change in household paper product prices?\nBecause the prices are increasing at a significant rate in just a short 4 years, I'm worried that soon they will become too high. This will negatively impact the community if people can't afford to buy basic necessities. \n\"Scaling Up: Percentage Surge in Household Items\"",

This reminded me of the toilet paper run at the beginning of covid and overall decrease in size of everything from chips to meals out.  Additionally, I looked at the y axis and all the items seemed to be things people use in their everyday life. This reminds me of the immediate and direct impact of inflation because a 20-30 increase in price over a four year span is quite high. It is something that we all deal with and has affected wages, housing, and day to day costs. This impacts me and my community because inflation is something that we see and deal with everyday as our money no longer has the reach it once did.

All 5 items have seen a price increase, but the price increase is more significant when accounting for size. This probably means there has been a reduction in product size or quantity for pricing. I wonder if when accounting for size, the increased cost shows a pattern that the price remains the same or increases while the product size decreases. Furthermore, what are the reasons behind this trend; are there economic factors or changes in manufacturing costs? Are these possible issues representative of a broader trend in the market of groceries? This highly impacts my community and I because most students have budgets or work to be able to afford to get a university education. This means we all have to budget more carefully if the amount of product is shrinking but pricing is rising since we are getting less food/necessities for our money.

It also appears that for each of the 5 items, the difference in price increase when adjusting for size and not adjusting for size is atleast around 2%. \n\nFrom evaluating this graph, I wonder what causes the difference in price when evaluating for size for each of these items. Have many manufacturers decreased item sizes over time for cost cutting measures, and is this what causes the price increase accounting for size to be more substantial. I also wonder if there are other trends or explanations for the \"accounting for size\" increase always being greater. Does this also mean that the average product size for each of the items listed has decreased over the last 4 years? \n\nThis has a tremendous impact on myself and my community being that increases of over 20% for all of these items certain affects an individuals purchasing power and could limit how accessible these items are to various people. Additionally, if item quantities have shrunk which could be evident by the \"accounting for size\" variable, then individuals may be forced to purchase more of a certain item  or make more frequent purchases.\n\n\"Price Changes to Everyday Items\"",

The biggest increase being in household paper products and the least being coffee. Obviously the biggest world wide event to happen in this time period is the pandemic. I also wonder where they pulled this data, specifically what countries. The pandemic affected parts of the world differently, so based on where the data was pulled could definitely affect the results of the data and to what population we can associate it to. \nI would imagine that products like paper towels, toilet paper, and tissues, products that are usually associated with sickness, are what contributed to the price increase of household paper products. As demand increases, so does the price. It also makes sense for coffee to have the smallest increase as people were likely less active during the pandemic and so then did the need for coffee. This also most likely shows the average rate of inflation. \nI think that it's really interesting that during this 4 year span, I never noticed that prices were increasing, let alone by 25%.

The large increase accounting for size is interesting to me, since it implies that the products being sold today are simultaneously more expensive and less efficient per unit. I wonder how much of these price raises were caused by the Covid pandemic and then never decreased once things went back to the new normal. For a lot of the lower cost items, such as the coffee and the candy, the percent change doesn't change the total price that much, but there is still the trend of companies charging more while offering less overall. I wonder if these trends also appear in general groceries and other everyday products, and  also how these changes in general compare to changes in wage and cost of living. Knowing how prices of products have changed can help inform large scale wage changes on local, state, and federal level. In order for wages to be adjusted in a way that properly reflects the cost of everyday life, you need to have a complete knowledge of the factors going into that cost.\nA title for the graph could be \"Less Bang for your Buck: Shrinkflation in Today's Economy\"",

I wonder how this trend in increased prices will increase over the course of the next five years. Will we see a similar increase in the price inflation, or will it increase exponentially?

As a constant participant in the world of consumerism, I find myself buying something almost every day, whether it be a living necessity or something for my own enjoyment.

Similarly, more people might have needed tissues because a symptom of covid is a runny nose. This affects my community because increasing prices means limiting people\u2019s access to these items.

Paper products have the greatest price increase when accounting for size. \"Accounting for size\" adjusts the price change to reflect any changes in the quantity or size of the product, which is leading to an even higher price per dollar value than from years past. In every category, the price increase is more significant when size is accounted for, what most call \"shrinkflation.\" I wonder what caused the increase in prices and whether it was due to inflation, increased production costs or just pure greed. I wonder how these price changes compare to the overall rate of inflation and whether people's salaries increased at the same rate (probably not). I also wonder why paper products have the greatest price increase in general, maybe due to the toilet paper crisis during COVID.  The increase in everyday products like snacks and household items have caused strain in my families budgets since I remember that we always used to have way more food at home after going to the grocery store, but now we only wait for sales and buy as little as we can. The difference in price when size is accounted for means that we are paying more for less, which lead to us buying more off brand items instead to help combat shrinkflation.

    "comment info": "The first thing I noticed was how much each product\u2019s price change increased when accounting for quantity and size, nodding to how companies are increasing prices because of inflation but also decreasing the quantity/volume of products to reach desirable profit margins. Given that consumers purchase these products very often, it is probably difficult to notice subtle changes in quantity especially over long periods. I wonder whether this trend applies to all other consumer items since there could be other items that may not be as different when, for example, adjusting for size or increasing prices due to inflation. I also wonder how household paper products' largest change in price relates to COVID-19 when many households stocked up on toilet paper to the point where stores ran out of paper products. I wonder if these household paper product companies noticed how crucial their products are to consumers and decided to increase profit margins even greater than they were before. This relates to me both as a consumer and a statistician because, in an economy already struggling with inflation, shrinkflation, COVID-19 recovery, etc., it is difficult to navigate what products are worth my time and money. To see these companies increasing their profit margins makes me question whether they have their consumers\u2019 best interests in mind or solely want to exploit us for money.

First of all, since the x-axis does not start at 0, the price increase of coffee seems to be small in comparison to the others, even though a 20% increase is still fairly large. Additionally, since the x-axis is based on percentage increases instead of actual dollar increases, it standardizes the scale so it is easier to compare the 5 items. However, this means we do not know how the dollars increased, so it can be difficult to interpret the actual difference in pricing. Since the item categories are very general, I wonder what items are included in each category, and how the prices are calculated across all those items. This information is very relevant to everyone in my community because we all went through the pandemic, so to see how most of the products being used on a daily basis have increased significantly from before coronavirus hit the US is quite important to us all. Also, as a college student, knowing how much more these items are costing motivates me to save more and reduce my spending on unnecessary items.\nTitle:  \u201cLess Costs More: How Shrinkflation is Affecting Essentials Post-Pandemic\u201d",

I also notice, at least for these 5 chosen items, that the minimum percentage change of price is slightly above 20% increase and the maximum being just under 35% increase. One could also see that household paper products has increased the most and coffee has increased the least. The spread of the size variability also seems fairly consistent between coffee, household cleaning products, and candy and chewing gum, being at about a difference of 2-3%. Even further we see that household paper products have the biggest spread in price change, at about a 4% difference. The main thing I wonder is whether the big price change of household paper products has to do with recent increases in environmental friendliness, that people want to use more paper products to help reduce the amount of plastic being used. I also wonder how the price of inflation has affected these items, and what other events have lead to these items having their respective price change. This relates to my community, as a college student, in that we are currently living in a high-inflation society. Where the price of inflation and prices are drastically higher than the increase of pay.

The graph makes me wonder if purchasing in bulk is better in the long run for the average consumer. Perhaps buying a lot of something at one time is more a cost-efficient mean of purchasing in comparison to buying just enough to get you by over and over again. Similar to several other economists from Elk Rapids in this comment section, I, too, have noticed this inflation in my everyday life. For example, Frito Lay, the company that owns Fritos and Pepsi was put in a predicament in which they had to raise their prices to continue making the same amount of profit. Frito Lay had to raise the prices of Fritos as opposed to raising the price of Pepsi, where the real problem was because Fritos are less elastic in peoples' everyday lives and if Pepsi prices rose, they wouldn't sell as well. This sure leaves you with something to think about. \ud83e\udd14",

Therefore, size is indeed a factor in determining the final prices of these grocery items, as one would expect (i.e. if I get a large coffee, I would expect to pay more than when buying a small coffee). When not taking into account size, the percentage change in price is lower than this value than when accounting for size. It seems like accounting for size provides a more accurate result of the percentage change. Overall, the prices of these products have increased a fairly large amount between 2019 and 2023. I am curious as to how sizes of household paper products are taken into account here. For example, would a small size be four paper towel rolls vs. a larger size being twelve? Also, what kinds of household paper products are included in this visualization? Toilet paper? Paper towels? Napkins? I am a college student who buys such products very frequently. Moreover, I live in a college town where fellow students like me need to have easy access to these products. If items like paper and cleaning products keep increasing in price, this would have a significant impact on accessibility of these basic yet very necessary grocery items for consumers like students who do not have a significant amount of money to spend. A headline for this visualization could be: \u201cEssential Yet Expensive: The Effect of Inflation on Basic Household Products\u201d.",

This makes me wonder if people even take a second thought at the correlation between price and size. Are companies taking advantage of everyday people in communities or is it fair for the size of the product?",

I also notice that this graph includes pre, mid, and post pandemic dates which would be an influence in the price fluctuations. I think that the grocery stores have found that because these are such staple household items, they can easily raise prices and cover that with size without the consumers noticing.\n\nI wonder if the reason in the increase is due to inflation. I know these past few years inflation rates have been at an all time high and that could definitely be a reason for the price increase. I also am wondering if maybe the demand of COVID and the fact that during the pandemic most of these items were hard to come by, especially paper products, has allowed grocery stores to raise their prices without the consequence of less people buying them. And the fact that they were able to raise the prices has given them confidence to constantly keep increasing the prices of these items.\n\nThis directly applies to my community of being a student in college who does not have a full time job nor steady income. These items are ones that I know both me and many of my peers purchase almost weekly.

From modest increases in coffee prices to substantial jumps in household paper products, the effects of size reductions on price hikes are notable. As college students, these shifts hit close to home, prompting us to reconsider our budgets and shopping habits. Every cent matters when balancing expenses, especially with noticeable rises in household cleaning products and snacks, staples for late-night study sessions. The broader economic trends reflected in these price changes raise questions about consumer perception, underlying factors driving shifts, and the long-term implications on spending habits and economic stability.

Everyone is aware of the price of candy when they were young \u201cI could buy a chocolate for a nickel\u201d a younger audience is aware of the prices and can connect to these statistics.",

It can be seen that all products have gone up in price no matter the genre, so inflation is prominent. Accounting for size checks price per unit measurement, so it is more accurate.",

My theory on why they chose those is that they could be items that apply to different audiences, and not just a niche household. It is definetely very eye opening to see how high prices really are going, while income staying the same.",

For example milk and eggs can't be hoarded beacuse they expire whereas some of the foods on the list are shelf safe. It is also worth noting that these items are all increasing in price and also increasingmore when incorperating size which could show a somewhat biases inclusion of items.",

Coffee has increased in price the least while house hold paper products have increased the most in price. It seems that the \"snacks\" category has the biggest difference in price when accounting for size compared to the other categories. I wonder why it is that household paper products have increased the most in price/been most affected by inflation? I wonder if this increase in price is connected to environmental changes/accessibility to producing these products. All products included in the graph are essentials that people use everyday, especially college students. The increase in price of these products may affect a students' ability to easily access all of the products.\n\nHeadline Idea: \"Wallet Worries: Inflation's Effect on Essentials\"",

I'm curious how these increases compare to the overall U.S. inflation rate during the same period to determine if these price hikes are disproportionately high. I also wonder the main reasons behind this trend of inflation and if there is anything we could do to either lessen it or stop it as a whole. This issue affects me and my community directly as these are items we purchase regularly. Unfortunately, since many of these items are essential, there's little we can do about the rising costs, yet we will still need to make these purchases in order to live our daily lives. This can be extremely problematic if these everyday items become too unaffordable for certain communities.\n\nHeadline: \"Staple Goods: From Basic to Beyond Reach\"",

I would like to see how these percentage changes compare to the U.S. inflation rate over this time to see if these increases are higher than the overall price increases that we would expect. I also wonder about some context behind this as to why the prices are increasing. For example, is the price of paper products so much higher because of a worldwide paper shortage? \n\nThis relates to me and my community because the items depicted in the graph are weekly purchases that we all make. Unfortunately, there is not much we can about inflated prices because some of these items are necessities. With such demand, the prices can keep rising and we will still just have to pay it. \n\nHeadline: \"Everyday Essentials Becoming a Luxury\"",

Inflation has been skyrocketing the past 2 years and this graph depicts just how alarming that is; some items having a 30% increase. I wonder if this will continue or if we\u2019ll see a plateau in the increase in prices. I wonder how bad this is going to get the next 3-5 years and where we\u2019ll be at. This has a huge impact on the community and the entire economy as a whole. Prices of everything will go up, minimum wage will go up, causing the price of goods to go up even more. It\u2019s a viscous cycle and we need a solution fast. Groceries will become completely unaffordable and the community will feel the impact.
