It appears that prior to that megadrought, there was a period of 75th+ percentile soil moisture, and directly after the megadrought was another one. It leads me to wonder why that occurs. Given that there is currently a megadrought in the Southwest, will there be a period over the next 50 or so years where the soil moisture is over the 75th percentile?

Lighter browns usually indicate dryness, while greens indicate well nourished and watered soil through grass. Also, the smaller graph in the corner shows that, since 1520, Nevada and New Mexico have been less dry than California, Arizona, and Colorado. \nWhat do I wonder?\n- What factors caused Nevada and New Mexico to be less dry than California, Colorado, and Arizona, despite being in the same general area? \n- What happened around the eighteenth century that to the soil being particularly wet that year? \n- What factors led to the soil being dry enough around the 1600s and mid-1900s to warrant an orange coloring on the graph? \nWhat do I think is going on in this graph?\n- I think this graph is exhibiting how wet or dry the soil was in the Southwest from 1520 to the 2000s based on rainfall. The small graph in the corner depicts the driest areas of the Southwest in 2000-2001 since 1520. \nHow does this relate to you and your community?\n- This relates to me since I have lived in the Southwest before--specifically Arizona.

    "comment info": "1. What I noticed about this graph is that there were a total of 2 major droughts that occurred. One was from 1572-1600 and another one is from 2000-present. I also noticed that the wettest points were after the droughts in which there was a spike in soil moisture.\n\n2. What I wonder is that by using this data, can there be a possibility of finding a solution to these droughts? Also, could it be that this current megadrought is causing the spike in wildfires?\n\n3. The way this relates to my community is that this past summer, the state of New Jersey was on drought alert and summer 2022 was the hottest summer recorded since 2016. Also, this past summer here it was very dry to a point where the front lawns and backyards were drying up worse than usual.\n\n4. This graph is showing data that was recorded from thousands of years ago to the present time regarding soil moisture which is causing droughts. \n\"No Rain Equals Pain\"",

I notice that there was a mega drought, then a large percentage of rain, then it averaged out on a plateau for a while. However, now, a new mega drought is upon us. I wonder if after this mega drought, there will be a large percentage of rain, just like what happened last time.

We also wondered what caused the megadrought from 1572-1600.  This data directly impacts us, as we are at a school in one of these states - Colorado.  We were thinking about the impact on our community in terms of farming and talking about how vertical farming might become more popular since it uses less water.  We also had a conversation about what might be causing the current dryness and how it can be slowed/stopped (electric vehicles came up).

Areas where there is lots of brown represent periods of time with drought. There is a large patch of drought between 1572-1600 and since 2000-2022. I also notice that after times of lots of drought there is a patch of very moist soil. I wonder if this is a scientific thing. I also wonder why it was barely dry burn the 1620's, 1700's-20's, 1810's, and around 2000. Are the just measuring the top of the soil or a certain amount into the ground. This relates to my community because if droughts are getting worse in the Southwest, it could harm the crops being grown there. This means that certain types of produce may not be in the grocery stores this fall and if they are the prices will probably be higher than before.

    "comment info": "In this graph, we are shown the history of droughts in the Southwest region. A megadrought occurred from 1572-1600, lasting for 28 years. The soil mositure during that drought was incredibly dry, and water was most likely scarce. But for three centuries after that, the droughts stayed calm. Until, suddenly they weren't, and the issues of global warming increased and we are now experiencing a megadrought in the Southwest. But how? How did it stay so calm during that time period? As our world began to warm up, and issues of climate change got larger and larger, how did it not dry out? Living in the South, you expect to experience things like severe heat, but a drought causes things more than just dryness. A drought causes shortages of water, and water of poor quality. A long-lasting drought could cause water scarcity. Communites in the Southwest will experience water scarcity if this drought continues for a long period of time. Once again, this graph shows the history of droughts in the Southwest. And to conclude, my headline for this graph is, \"So dry the birds are making barbed wire nests!\"",

I wonder if back then they had less driest lands then now? \n\n3. What impacts me and my community is that we have more driest lands than wettest lands and we need to start to recycle and pick up trash to have a better community and world to live in. We need to start to take good out earth because animals are getting hurt by our actions of not throw the trash in the trash been.  \n\n4.

The data was entered into what appears to be a climograph that shows data for temperature and precipitation. This can illustrate that when the drought becomes drier, less precipitation can be anticipated. A 25 percentile drought that predominantly affected roughly 50\u201360% of the area occurred between the years 1750 and 1980. \n\n2) I wonder if climatologists are trying to find a solution to the mega-drought that is currently happening in the southwest regions? Has this affected the agriculture of mass food-producing states? Does human interference have any contribution to this sudden change in climate?\n\n3) This graph relates to my community in El Salvador. Around 50% of the people in Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador are affected by the accumulation of heat brought on by climate change, which has left their crops devastated and left 7 million people in Latin America without enough natural resources for their agriculture, making it difficult to find food. Climate has also caused a drop in livestock in both the U.S and E.S which comes to show that these effects need to be stopped in order to replenish our resources. \n\n4) I would give the graph the title \"MEGA DROUGHT: Effects of Climate Change Experienced Throughout the Globe is Showing its Unmerciful Impact On the SouthWest\"",

This relates to my community because I come from a country that has dealt with a drought before. Usually when a drought occurs in a country, the crops face a massive drop in production since the soil is dry. Mexico in 1996 had one of the worst droughts on record and the country suffered a huge crop loss. Even today, nearly 85% of the country is currently facing dry weather conditions. This causes a problem for the people as they have less crops to produce and it progressively gets difficult to get fresh products to eat or sell.\n\n4.

The graph also seems to oscillate between dry and wet seasons approximately every 50 years.\n\n2. How will this \u2018mega drought\u2019 affect the price of food and water for the people in the area\n\n3. Does this graph follow other climate change trends?

It relates to the community that California is one of driest countries as we don't get much rain. There's seem to be more dry seasons than the rain. A catchy headline would be Driest in the Southwest.",
