However, those wither higher parental income had a proportionally larger benefit: up to 7 times the average for the top 0.1%, compared to less than triple (already high) for non-legacy. This leaves several burning questions: among them, why are admissions so heavily skewed in favor of high-income, legacy applicants, and what steps can colleges take to reduce this (likely-systematic) bias?",

This could be for a variety of factors such as the fact that hire income families don't require scholarships and have access to more tutoring and educational resources, therefore getting better grades and more likely to give the school mor money. These reasons should not cause an equally hard working student with less resources, less connections, and less money, but of the same intelligence to not be admitted. Unfortunately this is not the case. It is also important to note that statistics can be very easily skewed and data is hard to collect 100% accurately so we still do not know the exact statistics and factors that go into these decisions.",

Another thing that I noticed was for those who fell under the category of parents income between the 70th and 90th percentile actually had a lower admission rate than those who had slightly lower and higher income.

Interestingly enough, the admissions rate for the same income brackets of legacy applicants do not follow this trend but rather continually get higher until reaching the extremes.\nI wonder of what the admissions graph would look like if instead of using the income percentiles, the graph used fixed yearly salaries. According to what I saw in the bottom of the page, the 99 or 99.9 percentiles represented those with an income of 620k+, I would be interested to see how admissions rates change in the millions or tens/hundreds of millions range. I believe that this graph relates to Texas in the way that many students in this state, regardless of socioeconomic status, do not even apply to out-of-state colleges in the first place. Many students are happy to stick with applying with their regional legacy schools.

You can tell from the graph that having a parent attend that college raises the applicant's chances significantly, but interestingly, it most affects the rich. This is most likely because wealthy people tend to donate to their alma mater, especially when they have a child hoping to attend that school.  This shows how the college selection process has become increasingly biased and no longer based on the student and their accomplishment.

If you're not rich with family, you have a chance, and if you're not rich and don't have family who went there, it's over for you pal.\n\nWhat do you wonder?- I wonder if things would be different if they stopped taking parental income into the equation.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?- I live in a town where many people went to ivy league schools so this isn't super new information.

The 99.9 percentile of legacy applicants have more than 6x the advantage compared to the average. Still, the 99.9 percentile of non-legacy applicants has around the same advantage or less than the poorer legacy applicants. \n\nI wonder why they value legacy students more than even the rich non-legacy students. I also wonder how different the admission process is for non-legacy, legacy, rich, and poor. \n\nIt relates to me because a lot of people think that whether you go to college or not is a very important determinant of your future.

For more elite schools, the familial ties a student has to a school could be the largest factor in their application, boosting their chances about 7x. Nearly all students at the most prestigious universities are legacy students. This affects me because I am in the college admissions process. My chances of being admitted to an Ivy League are very low because I am not a legacy at any of them. I wonder why this kind of bias is still allowed in the decision process. There have been legislations passed in the last few years that have taken race, economic, and standardized testing bias out of the process.

It is clear from this graph that in every income rank, legacy status helps boost admission. I find it insane that very wealthy people with legacy status are 7x more likely to get into a school than a poorer person without status who worked just as hard to get the same scores. I wonder why there is such a bias in college admissions. One reason for this bias is that wealthy families may donate a lot of money to the school which could put applicants at an advantage. However, one would assume that by having all this wealth, one already has an advantage in life. Therefore, giving a wealthy and a poor person who both have legacy status and have the same scores unequal opportunities is solidifying those societal norms. Also the poor students not getting into these elite colleges because they are put at an inherent disadvantage when applying, it is further hindering their opportunities in life. I wonder if giving out financial aid is one of the reasons that poorer students who have the same credentials as wealthy students have a less likely chance of getting into a school. I know that financial aid is limited. This affects me because I will be applying to colleges soon. Some schools are doing away with legacy status, so I am not sure how much this graph will affect me. \n\"Legacy Boost= Bias\"",

I noticed that, generally, richer applicants had a greater estimated legacy boost than those who were poorer. For example, as the parents\u2019 income rank became closer and closer to 100th, the estimated legacy boost became closer and closer to 7x. Whereas, on the other hand, poorer applicants closer to an income rank of 10th seemed to only have an estimated legacy boost of 2x. I wonder if the legacy boost is greater for applicants whose parents have a higher income rank because having a richer background increases the chances of multiple generations of family members being able to afford attending that college. Additionally, I noticed that the estimated advantage in admissions for those without legacy status on the richer end of the spectrum was lower than for those who were poorer and wonder why this is the case. I also wonder what criteria and processes a school uses to determine their legacy boost discrepancies and if this varies from college to college. This applies to my community because I recently went through the college process and the concept of legacy advantage has been a concern for many. It can be unfair as applicants can have very similar profiles to legacy applicants yet those with legacy are favored over them.

Additionally, I find it interesting that there is a dip in the graph for applicants without a legacy status in which the parents are around the 70th percentile in income. This is intriguing because parents with a relatively low income (in the \u201cpoorer\u201d income rank) were two times as likely to be admitted. With this, I noticed and wondered why the \u201cpoorer\u201d and \u201cricher\u201d extreme income rank almost reached the same likelihood of admittance for non-legacy applicants. Furthermore, I wonder how the graph would appear individually for each of the elite colleges (which elite college favors more legacies overall?).

Why do these schools not attempt to give opportunities to people who may not have a lot of money but have the potential to be incredibly successful if they are given the opportunity to study at a prestigious university? It is very likely that these legacy families donate large sums of money to the universities and continue to do so as their children and their grandchildren get accepted. These donations provide the university with significant benefits and could be a very likely reason why they choose to admit legacy students who are very likely to attend and who have parents who will provide continuous donations to the university during and after their time there. If they choose not to accept a legacy student they may lose some of their best donors, and prestigious universities make incredible amounts of money from their donations and would not want to lose these funds. -unifished see other post",

To a certain extent, income also seems to be a determining factor in admission rates. Students with family incomes ranking in the top 10% are much more likely to be admitted than those in the bottom 10%. \n\nThe fact that students are more likely to be admitted when their family income is higher is interesting. Many colleges claim to be need-blind when looking at college applications, so the data has to be due to other factors possibly influenced by higher income. Students with more resources have easier access to information, tutors, or other outside assistance. These resources are likely to positively impact their academic performance and college applications. However, students with less resources end up disadvantaged in comparison to these students.\n\nThis graph sheds light on how a student\u2019s family background \u2014 something they have no control over \u2014 can impact their lives. A student whose family has a higher income and more access to resources will typically end up more successful than one with a lower income. As a community, students with less access to resources needed for academic excellence need to be addressed. If we can address this issue, we can reduce the disparity between legacy and non-legacy, or high-income and low-income.\n\nHeadline:\nLeaving Others Behind:  Legacy and High-Income Students Secure College Spots at Unfairly High Rates",

In the graph we can see a student in the top one percent is over 7 times more likely to be accepted to a school. Additionally students from wealthy parents are most likely to have parents who are legacy. I wonder how colleges are still able to accept students based on their finical status rather than Merit. I wonder with the overturning of affirmative action if this will be the next thing to go in the college admission process.

The black line (legacy applicants) is significantly higher than the gray line (non-legacy applicants), indicating that elite schools favor legacy. Legacy applicants appear to automatically have double the chance of acceptance. It also is apparent that both types of applicants have a spiked chance of getting into an elite college when their parent\u2019s income surpasses the 90th percentile. One thing that stood out to me was that applicants without legacy status who fall into the middle-class range have less of a chance of getting into an elite college versus an applicant with poorer or richer incomes. Do colleges discriminate against middle-class applicants because they are not rich enough to generate a lot of money but not poor enough to even out their statistics in appearing to be a school that caters to all financial statuses? This relates to me because as a current senior applying to college, I have had to witness students get into colleges just because of their legacy status and or because their parents have a higher income. Even though we may have the same statistics, colleges will always choose the legacy/richer applicant. This has hurt all students, not just me, and our disadvantage when it comes to being a middle class without legacy status when applying to elite colleges. \n\n\u201cCollege: The Legacy of a Rich Man\u2019s World!\u201d",

Finally, after the 85th percentile, there is an increase in admission likelihood for both students with and without the legacy boost, although there is a more drastic increase for those with the legacy boost.\nI wonder why the likelihood of admittance for legacy applicants remains close to constant for most of the graph. Why does the likelihood of admittance drop so drastically for non-legacy applicants around the 70th Parent\u2019s income rank?\nFor people from my community, this shows that those with parents who graduated from selective schools are more likely to be admitted than those whose parents did not graduate from a selective school.

Additionally, we might also not have the different resources for the criterion of admissions at elite universities- which wealthy private schools might have readily available. \n\nCreate a catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea.\nSystemic barriers captivating colleges: Legacies leading admission",

However, for legacy applicants, the line is more extreme and favors richer students more.\n- I wonder how this data was collected and why both lines have a tiny peak right before they get really steep. Additionally, I wonder if the problem would be solved by colleges not having access to parents' income information or whether the applicant is a legacy. The latter would be harder to accomplish, but it seems like withholding the info about money would be relatively easy.\n- This relates to my community because I interact with both people who might be legacy applicants and people who might be the first in their family to go to college.

I think it refers to something different than what you wrote.  \n\nWhy do you think this study was done and The New York Times had an article that featured it?",

Also what purpose does putting the y-axis on the right as opposed to the left have? \n\nRelates to me and my community: Many colleges are similar to the Elite ones in this data even if they aren't in the limelight for this particular graph. To some extent you can guess that this may apply to most if not all schools and that will affect college choices that are considered and what school counselors and teachers tell their students about where they should apply and where they might not get in for one reason or another.\n\nHeadline: Legacy and Income: How these 2 factors can change whether you get into your top college or not",

The graph\u2019s y axis scale seems more consistent and equally spaced out. Legacy applicants are more likely to be accepted into an Ivy League school than the average admission rate of those students who are not legacy applicants. If their parent\u2019s income rank is higher, there are more students accepted into Ivy League schools in general, but much more for legacy applicants.  \n\nWonder: I wonder why they felt the need to skew the data on the x axis? What benefit does it really do to encourage the idea that legacy applicants have a more likely chance of being admitted into an Ivy League school?\n\nRelate: This data is applicable and similar to other tiers of colleges as well. Numerous college admissions request essays, and the college may be more likely to accept a legacy applicant than one whose parents either went to another institution or didn\u2019t go to college at all. \n\nHeadline: Legacy Student Advantages in Admissions",

I agree with you that this is being displayed to show more change than is there. To attempt to answer your second question with a possibility, I think it might be to push against the bigger schools so less people want to attend because they see they are less likely to get in, leaving more room for kids who the graph shows are more likely to get in.  This could also be a way to push colleges to accept more students from lower income families who are not legacies.",

    "comment info": "Noticed: The chart is carefully crafted to support a kneejerk reaction that rich legacy applicants are getting admitted at the expense of poor applicants. Looking closer, I notice non-legacy applicants below the 40th income percentile have about 1.75 x the average non-legacy admissions rate. These applicants will likely need a lot of financial aid, due to the bloated cost of college. So the colleges accept a larger proportion of legacy applicants, particularly at the higher income levels. The colleges know that statistically, these applicants\u2019 families will donate large amounts, that can be redistributed down to the 40th percentile and below. Legacy admission advantage and lower-income admissions advantage are the yin and yang of college admissions. At first glance, colleges appear to be acting as Robin Hoods, taking from the rich and giving to the poor. But looking deeper, they are really acting as Grifters \u2013 Bloating up their staff and salaries, then stealing from the rich to give to the poor, then demanding the poor turn the money over to \u2013 the colleges\u2019 bloated staff and salaries!\nIt's disappointing but not surprising that The NY Times, which sees victimhood everywhere, cannot bring itself to delve deeper into this to provide a comprehensive, fair analysis.",

    "comment info": "Noticed: The difference between the estimated legacy boost and without the legacy boost is quite significant, especially since students have the same test scores. Not only does the legacy boost increase the chance of getting into that college, but the parents income rank further strengthens that boost making it extremely difficult for a person without a legacy boost, or parents with high income, to be admitted to some of the more elite colleges. \nWondered: How many students did they use as data points to get this graph of data? Would the data have changed if the students had different test scores? What where the test scores of the students? Could they have colored coded the lines depending on the different colleges the students where aiming for? \nRelate: This information is very useful for students trying to apply to different colleges, because it shows how depending on your legacy and parents income rank, you have to work really hard if you don't have those 2 things and because I am also aiming for a more competitive college, I am able to observe this information and use it to my advantage when applying for colleges. \nHeadline: Student Advantages In Elite Colleges",

If you are a legacy applicant and your parents are richer (99th Percentile) then you are the most likely applicants to get admitted into elite colleges. \nWondered: In general, why do legacy applicants have such an advantage getting into elite colleges? I wonder if we were to split the data up and have a separate graph for each elite college, would there be discrepancies between graphs or would they all look similar to the graph used in this article?\nRelate: This relates to regular colleges as well. When filling out scholarship applications there is always a question about if your parents or siblings have gone to that specific college. That automatically qualifies you to get a chance at better scholarships. \nHeadline: Inherited Admission to Elite Colleges",
