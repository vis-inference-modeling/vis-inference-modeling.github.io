    "comment info": "Part 1 What I notice about the map/graph is that the number one represents different organizations save millions of lives because, with all the warning systems that we have now, scientists can now tell cities or big villages ahead of time that there is a hurricane coming and that will hit shore in about 10 minutes. That gives enough time to escape and get to high ground before the hurricane swallows everything in its path.\n\nWhat I wonder is that were these maybe recent Tsunamis, or did they happen a long time ago. Like maybe 15-30 years ago. On text evidence number two it says that the N.H.C calculates their own there own timing, and how strong the storm is in that section of the area.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph is that it is showing various red circles around the tiny little spaced on the graph like this, example -----------. Many little lines like this one, are shown on the graph above. I claim that these little lines represent cities and villages territory or land space where the cities and all of the villages that accompany that big city in that country were all hit by the same Tsunami. How? Because when a Tsunami is formed, sound waves project on all four sides, which means that many other little villages will be crushed or swept away by all of the various waves. That is how I know that all of those little lines were cities or a lot of little villages that got hit by these tsunamis.",

    "comment info": "What causes the tsunami to move into the cone shape form and sometimes outside of it is that it goes through a small city or a big enough village is that it goes in a straight enough line and all of the buildings and homes make all that water go in a straight line. The reason why the tsunami may sometimes go outside the cone is that almost every place that is near the ocean has a wall of security to prevent that the water flows in and sweeps away everything in its path. The wall or the whole land/island is round or maybe half-round, and that may make the big wave turn or bounce off and go into another direction that is directed out of the cone's area.\n\nThe tsunami can affect areas as I said in my 4th paragraph that because of its giant waves, they can go in all four directions of the ocean heading for nearby or far away villages.\n\nThese were all of the things I noticed or wrote about this map or graph of hurricanes/tsunamis.",

I think that how they all connected together is not really connected but side to side that go in a cone shaped pattern. How I know is that just like in paragraph number three, when one tsunami happens It creates at least 3-4 more tsunamis that all go to different and separate areas. Which means that the first one happened. It next goes on to the other part of the ocean to another part of town or villages, then another one and another one, and of course not each one will probably go in a straight line. They will all curve a little more each time another one is triggered, and that is what formes the cone shape tsunami graph that is shown here above.",

In addition, the fact that point 1, \"different organizations make their forecasts\", was outside of a circle and not even in the \"cone\" where the other circles are led me to the conclusion that this is probably because the different organizations (that may not be weather-related) may not have made valid hurricane predictions.

I notice that the weather predictions are most precise during the earliest points after the hurricane makes landfall. This graph shows the most likely route for the hurricane, but it could take other paths. The farther away the hurricane is, the larger the circles become, showing that the weather predictions become less precise. Outside of the cone made by the circles, there is a shaded red area that could sill be affected by the storm. I wonder what hurricane this could be, or what the actual outcome was. I also wonder how the N.H.C. created this prediction. One possible title for this graph could be \"Predictions for XYZ Hurricane\".",

This map is just an example, or as you have in your headline \u201cXYZ\u201d, and not for Dorian.  For Dorian, regretfully, I did not save all of the maps so we can\u2019t look at the projections and analyze how accurate the forecasts were.  But going to the NHC website at hurricanes.gov, you can do this for a future hurricanes.  (I checked.  Right now, there are no hurricanes in the Atlantic, Eastern North Pacific, or Central Pacific \u2013 the 3 regions that the NHC publishes forecast maps.)",

I also notice that the track gets wider as it goes along because they have less certainty of where the hurricane is going to end up. I wonder what kind of technology was used to  predict the track of this hurricane. I wonder how this kind of weather affects the land that it covers. I am curious about whether this specific kind of storm can happen in other areas of the world. I am also curious about what kind of statistics can apply to this graph. In this visual, it shows that the hurricane starts in Florida and travels upwards through the Florida into the southeast region of the US. The cone is not an exact prediction of the storms track and gets increasingly uncertain as it goes on through time. A catchy headline for this would be \"Projections of Hurricane in the Southeast Region of the US\"",

Though no weather forecast has stated this information, this graph shows the red shaded areas as \u201cdifferent organizations\u201d forecasts, displaying the variation in predictions.

That gives enough time to escape and get to high ground before the hurricane swallows everything in its path.\n\nWhat I wonder is that were these maybe recent Tsunamis, or did they happen a long time ago. Like maybe 15-30 years ago. On text evidence number two it says that the N.H.C calculates their own there own timing, and how strong the storm is in that section of the area.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph is that it is showing various red circles around the tiny little spaced on the graph like this, example -----------. Many little lines like this one, are shown on the graph above. I claim that these little lines represent cities and villages territory or land space where the cities and all of the villages that accompany that big city in that country were all hit by the same Tsunami. How? Because when a Tsunami is formed, sound waves project on all four sides, which means that many other little villages will be crushed or swept away by all of the various waves. That is how I know that all of those little lines were cities or a lot of little villages that got hit by these tsunamis.",

The reason why the tsunami may sometimes go outside the cone is that almost every place that is near the ocean has a wall of security to prevent that the water flows in and sweeps away everything in its path. The wall or the whole land/island is round or maybe half-round, and that may make the big wave turn or bounce off and go into another direction that is directed out of the cone's area.\n\nThe tsunami can affect areas as I said in my 4th paragraph that because of its giant waves, they can go in all four directions of the ocean heading for nearby or far away villages.\n\nThese were all of the things I noticed or wrote about this map or graph of hurricanes/tsunamis.",

I think that how they all connected together is not really connected but side to side that go in a cone shaped pattern. How I know is that just like in paragraph number three, when one tsunami happens It creates at least 3-4 more tsunamis that all go to different and separate areas. Which means that the first one happened. It next goes on to the other part of the ocean to another part of town or villages, then another one and another one, and of course not each one will probably go in a straight line. They will all curve a little more each time another one is triggered, and that is what formes the cone shape tsunami graph that is shown here above.",

Therefore, the map cannot be a path of the movement of the hurricane. In addition, the fact that point 1, \"different organizations make their forecasts\", was outside of a circle and not even in the \"cone\" where the other circles are led me to the conclusion that this is probably because the different organizations (that may not be weather-related) may not have made valid hurricane predictions. After tracing the other circles, it appears that the smaller circles are more accurate, or they have more certainty regarding the hurricane.",

It uses projects from the prior five years to inform their projections, but how often does a hurricane take a different turn?  If frequently, this would result in a larger area and, consequently, a larger radius for the circles.  For the 2019-2020 hurricane year, the radii are 41 miles for the one-day forecast and as much as 198 miles for the five-day forecast.  You can get more information on the hurricane cone at www.hnc.noaa.gov/aboutcone.shtml.  Also, search the NHC website for an explanation of how they determine the hurricane\u2019s direction.",

I am curious about whether this specific kind of storm can happen in other areas of the world. I am also curious about what kind of statistics can apply to this graph. In this visual, it shows that the hurricane starts in Florida and travels upwards through the Florida into the southeast region of the US.

    "comment info": "Part 1 What I notice about the map/graph is that the number one represents different organizations save millions of lives because, with all the warning systems that we have now, scientists can now tell cities or big villages ahead of time that there is a hurricane coming and that will hit shore in about 10 minutes. That gives enough time to escape and get to high ground before the hurricane swallows everything in its path.\n\nWhat I wonder is that were these maybe recent Tsunamis, or did they happen a long time ago. Like maybe 15-30 years ago. On text evidence number two it says that the N.H.C calculates their own there own timing, and how strong the storm is in that section of the area.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph is that it is showing various red circles around the tiny little spaced on the graph like this, example -----------. Many little lines like this one, are shown on the graph above. I claim that these little lines represent cities and villages territory or land space where the cities and all of the villages that accompany that big city in that country were all hit by the same Tsunami. How? Because when a Tsunami is formed, sound waves project on all four sides, which means that many other little villages will be crushed or swept away by all of the various waves. That is how I know that all of those little lines were cities or a lot of little villages that got hit by these tsunamis.",

    "comment info": "What causes the tsunami to move into the cone shape form and sometimes outside of it is that it goes through a small city or a big enough village is that it goes in a straight enough line and all of the buildings and homes make all that water go in a straight line. The reason why the tsunami may sometimes go outside the cone is that almost every place that is near the ocean has a wall of security to prevent that the water flows in and sweeps away everything in its path. The wall or the whole land/island is round or maybe half-round, and that may make the big wave turn or bounce off and go into another direction that is directed out of the cone's area.\n\nThe tsunami can affect areas as I said in my 4th paragraph that because of its giant waves, they can go in all four directions of the ocean heading for nearby or far away villages.\n\nThese were all of the things I noticed or wrote about this map or graph of hurricanes/tsunamis.",

I think that how they all connected together is not really connected but side to side that go in a cone shaped pattern. How I know is that just like in paragraph number three, when one tsunami happens It creates at least 3-4 more tsunamis that all go to different and separate areas. Which means that the first one happened. It next goes on to the other part of the ocean to another part of town or villages, then another one and another one, and of course not each one will probably go in a straight line. They will all curve a little more each time another one is triggered, and that is what formes the cone shape tsunami graph that is shown here above.",

The map depicts a prediction about a hurricane, labeling what each area means. The news in the past few days has been addressing President Trump\u2019s tweet about Hurricane Dorain heading towards Alabama. Though no weather forecast has stated this information, this graph shows the red shaded areas as \u201cdifferent organizations\u201d forecasts, displaying the variation in predictions. I find it interesting, however, that statements are made about areas past the greatest uncertainty (largest circles,) when there is little to no information to stand on when stating these claims.",

The dotted lines throughout the graph symbolize different organizations' predictions of the hurricane and where it will hit.

That gives enough time to escape and get to high ground before the hurricane swallows everything in its path.\n\nWhat I wonder is that were these maybe recent Tsunamis, or did they happen a long time ago. Like maybe 15-30 years ago. On text evidence number two it says that the N.H.C calculates their own there own timing, and how strong the storm is in that section of the area.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph is that it is showing various red circles around the tiny little spaced on the graph like this, example -----------. Many little lines like this one, are shown on the graph above. I claim that these little lines represent cities and villages territory or land space where the cities and all of the villages that accompany that big city in that country were all hit by the same Tsunami. How? Because when a Tsunami is formed, sound waves project on all four sides, which means that many other little villages will be crushed or swept away by all of the various waves. That is how I know that all of those little lines were cities or a lot of little villages that got hit by these tsunamis.",

The reason why the tsunami may sometimes go outside the cone is that almost every place that is near the ocean has a wall of security to prevent that the water flows in and sweeps away everything in its path. The wall or the whole land/island is round or maybe half-round, and that may make the big wave turn or bounce off and go into another direction that is directed out of the cone's area.\n\nThe tsunami can affect areas as I said in my 4th paragraph that because of its giant waves, they can go in all four directions of the ocean heading for nearby or far away villages.\n\nThese were all of the things I noticed or wrote about this map or graph of hurricanes/tsunamis.",

I think that how they all connected together is not really connected but side to side that go in a cone shaped pattern. How I know is that just like in paragraph number three, when one tsunami happens It creates at least 3-4 more tsunamis that all go to different and separate areas. Which means that the first one happened. It next goes on to the other part of the ocean to another part of town or villages, then another one and another one, and of course not each one will probably go in a straight line. They will all curve a little more each time another one is triggered, and that is what formes the cone shape tsunami graph that is shown here above.",

In addition, the fact that point 1, \"different organizations make their forecasts\", was outside of a circle and not even in the \"cone\" where the other circles are led me to the conclusion that this is probably because the different organizations (that may not be weather-related) may not have made valid hurricane predictions.

It's just that the probability that the storm will hit farther north is more uncertain and unpredictable. The main cone of the storm is the NHC's prediction of where the storm will travel, but different organizations have also been tracing the storm, signified by the dotted lines. It is hard to accurately predict the weather, but it is easier to find a general area based on different spots.",

I notice that the weather predictions are most precise during the earliest points after the hurricane makes landfall. This graph shows the most likely route for the hurricane, but it could take other paths. The farther away the hurricane is, the larger the circles become, showing that the weather predictions become less precise. Outside of the cone made by the circles, there is a shaded red area that could sill be affected by the storm. I wonder what hurricane this could be, or what the actual outcome was.

I am curious about whether this specific kind of storm can happen in other areas of the world. I am also curious about what kind of statistics can apply to this graph. In this visual, it shows that the hurricane starts in Florida and travels upwards through the Florida into the southeast region of the US. The cone is not an exact prediction of the storms track and gets increasingly uncertain as it goes on through time.

That gives enough time to escape and get to high ground before the hurricane swallows everything in its path.\n\nWhat I wonder is that were these maybe recent Tsunamis, or did they happen a long time ago. Like maybe 15-30 years ago. On text evidence number two it says that the N.H.C calculates their own there own timing, and how strong the storm is in that section of the area.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph is that it is showing various red circles around the tiny little spaced on the graph like this, example -----------. Many little lines like this one, are shown on the graph above. I claim that these little lines represent cities and villages territory or land space where the cities and all of the villages that accompany that big city in that country were all hit by the same Tsunami. How? Because when a Tsunami is formed, sound waves project on all four sides, which means that many other little villages will be crushed or swept away by all of the various waves. That is how I know that all of those little lines were cities or a lot of little villages that got hit by these tsunamis.",

The reason why the tsunami may sometimes go outside the cone is that almost every place that is near the ocean has a wall of security to prevent that the water flows in and sweeps away everything in its path. The wall or the whole land/island is round or maybe half-round, and that may make the big wave turn or bounce off and go into another direction that is directed out of the cone's area.\n\nThe tsunami can affect areas as I said in my 4th paragraph that because of its giant waves, they can go in all four directions of the ocean heading for nearby or far away villages.\n\nThese were all of the things I noticed or wrote about this map or graph of hurricanes/tsunamis.",

I think that how they all connected together is not really connected but side to side that go in a cone shaped pattern. How I know is that just like in paragraph number three, when one tsunami happens It creates at least 3-4 more tsunamis that all go to different and separate areas. Which means that the first one happened. It next goes on to the other part of the ocean to another part of town or villages, then another one and another one, and of course not each one will probably go in a straight line. They will all curve a little more each time another one is triggered, and that is what formes the cone shape tsunami graph that is shown here above.",

Therefore, the map cannot be a path of the movement of the hurricane. In addition, the fact that point 1, \"different organizations make their forecasts\", was outside of a circle and not even in the \"cone\" where the other circles are led me to the conclusion that this is probably because the different organizations (that may not be weather-related) may not have made valid hurricane predictions. After tracing the other circles, it appears that the smaller circles are more accurate, or they have more certainty regarding the hurricane.",

It uses projects from the prior five years to inform their projections, but how often does a hurricane take a different turn?  If frequently, this would result in a larger area and, consequently, a larger radius for the circles.  For the 2019-2020 hurricane year, the radii are 41 miles for the one-day forecast and as much as 198 miles for the five-day forecast.  You can get more information on the hurricane cone at www.hnc.noaa.gov/aboutcone.shtml.  Also, search the NHC website for an explanation of how they determine the hurricane\u2019s direction.",

I am curious about whether this specific kind of storm can happen in other areas of the world. I am also curious about what kind of statistics can apply to this graph. In this visual, it shows that the hurricane starts in Florida and travels upwards through the Florida into the southeast region of the US.

That gives enough time to escape and get to high ground before the hurricane swallows everything in its path.\n\nWhat I wonder is that were these maybe recent Tsunamis, or did they happen a long time ago. Like maybe 15-30 years ago. On text evidence number two it says that the N.H.C calculates their own there own timing, and how strong the storm is in that section of the area.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph is that it is showing various red circles around the tiny little spaced on the graph like this, example -----------. Many little lines like this one, are shown on the graph above. I claim that these little lines represent cities and villages territory or land space where the cities and all of the villages that accompany that big city in that country were all hit by the same Tsunami. How? Because when a Tsunami is formed, sound waves project on all four sides, which means that many other little villages will be crushed or swept away by all of the various waves. That is how I know that all of those little lines were cities or a lot of little villages that got hit by these tsunamis.",

The reason why the tsunami may sometimes go outside the cone is that almost every place that is near the ocean has a wall of security to prevent that the water flows in and sweeps away everything in its path. The wall or the whole land/island is round or maybe half-round, and that may make the big wave turn or bounce off and go into another direction that is directed out of the cone's area.\n\nThe tsunami can affect areas as I said in my 4th paragraph that because of its giant waves, they can go in all four directions of the ocean heading for nearby or far away villages.\n\nThese were all of the things I noticed or wrote about this map or graph of hurricanes/tsunamis.",

I think that how they all connected together is not really connected but side to side that go in a cone shaped pattern. How I know is that just like in paragraph number three, when one tsunami happens It creates at least 3-4 more tsunamis that all go to different and separate areas. Which means that the first one happened. It next goes on to the other part of the ocean to another part of town or villages, then another one and another one, and of course not each one will probably go in a straight line. They will all curve a little more each time another one is triggered, and that is what formes the cone shape tsunami graph that is shown here above.",

Therefore, the map cannot be a path of the movement of the hurricane. In addition, the fact that point 1, \"different organizations make their forecasts\", was outside of a circle and not even in the \"cone\" where the other circles are led me to the conclusion that this is probably because the different organizations (that may not be weather-related) may not have made valid hurricane predictions.

That gives enough time to escape and get to high ground before the hurricane swallows everything in its path.\n\nWhat I wonder is that were these maybe recent Tsunamis, or did they happen a long time ago. Like maybe 15-30 years ago. On text evidence number two it says that the N.H.C calculates their own there own timing, and how strong the storm is in that section of the area.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph is that it is showing various red circles around the tiny little spaced on the graph like this, example -----------. Many little lines like this one, are shown on the graph above. I claim that these little lines represent cities and villages territory or land space where the cities and all of the villages that accompany that big city in that country were all hit by the same Tsunami. How? Because when a Tsunami is formed, sound waves project on all four sides, which means that many other little villages will be crushed or swept away by all of the various waves. That is how I know that all of those little lines were cities or a lot of little villages that got hit by these tsunamis.",

The reason why the tsunami may sometimes go outside the cone is that almost every place that is near the ocean has a wall of security to prevent that the water flows in and sweeps away everything in its path. The wall or the whole land/island is round or maybe half-round, and that may make the big wave turn or bounce off and go into another direction that is directed out of the cone's area.\n\nThe tsunami can affect areas as I said in my 4th paragraph that because of its giant waves, they can go in all four directions of the ocean heading for nearby or far away villages.\n\nThese were all of the things I noticed or wrote about this map or graph of hurricanes/tsunamis.",

I think that how they all connected together is not really connected but side to side that go in a cone shaped pattern. How I know is that just like in paragraph number three, when one tsunami happens It creates at least 3-4 more tsunamis that all go to different and separate areas. Which means that the first one happened. It next goes on to the other part of the ocean to another part of town or villages, then another one and another one, and of course not each one will probably go in a straight line. They will all curve a little more each time another one is triggered, and that is what formes the cone shape tsunami graph that is shown here above.",

Therefore, the map cannot be a path of the movement of the hurricane. In addition, the fact that point 1, \"different organizations make their forecasts\", was outside of a circle and not even in the \"cone\" where the other circles are led me to the conclusion that this is probably because the different organizations (that may not be weather-related) may not have made valid hurricane predictions.

In this visual, it shows that the hurricane starts in Florida and travels upwards through the Florida into the southeast region of the US.

That gives enough time to escape and get to high ground before the hurricane swallows everything in its path.\n\nWhat I wonder is that were these maybe recent Tsunamis, or did they happen a long time ago. Like maybe 15-30 years ago. On text evidence number two it says that the N.H.C calculates their own there own timing, and how strong the storm is in that section of the area.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph is that it is showing various red circles around the tiny little spaced on the graph like this, example -----------. Many little lines like this one, are shown on the graph above. I claim that these little lines represent cities and villages territory or land space where the cities and all of the villages that accompany that big city in that country were all hit by the same Tsunami. How? Because when a Tsunami is formed, sound waves project on all four sides, which means that many other little villages will be crushed or swept away by all of the various waves. That is how I know that all of those little lines were cities or a lot of little villages that got hit by these tsunamis.",

The reason why the tsunami may sometimes go outside the cone is that almost every place that is near the ocean has a wall of security to prevent that the water flows in and sweeps away everything in its path. The wall or the whole land/island is round or maybe half-round, and that may make the big wave turn or bounce off and go into another direction that is directed out of the cone's area.\n\nThe tsunami can affect areas as I said in my 4th paragraph that because of its giant waves, they can go in all four directions of the ocean heading for nearby or far away villages.\n\nThese were all of the things I noticed or wrote about this map or graph of hurricanes/tsunamis.",

I think that how they all connected together is not really connected but side to side that go in a cone shaped pattern. How I know is that just like in paragraph number three, when one tsunami happens It creates at least 3-4 more tsunamis that all go to different and separate areas. Which means that the first one happened. It next goes on to the other part of the ocean to another part of town or villages, then another one and another one, and of course not each one will probably go in a straight line. They will all curve a little more each time another one is triggered, and that is what formes the cone shape tsunami graph that is shown here above.",

The solid black line is the path that the National Hurrican Center predicted. The big circles meant that the line is not exact and the inner part of the circle is uncertain. I wonder how this graph was made and how the information is found. I also wonder if there is another more accurate way to find out the track of the hurricane.",

Therefore, the map cannot be a path of the movement of the hurricane. In addition, the fact that point 1, \"different organizations make their forecasts\", was outside of a circle and not even in the \"cone\" where the other circles are led me to the conclusion that this is probably because the different organizations (that may not be weather-related) may not have made valid hurricane predictions. After tracing the other circles, it appears that the smaller circles are more accurate, or they have more certainty regarding the hurricane.",

Outside of the circles is a shaded area that could most likely be affected by the hurricane as well. I wonder how they predict what the hurricane\u2019s next move is?",

It uses projects from the prior five years to inform their projections, but how often does a hurricane take a different turn?  If frequently, this would result in a larger area and, consequently, a larger radius for the circles.  For the 2019-2020 hurricane year, the radii are 41 miles for the one-day forecast and as much as 198 miles for the five-day forecast.  You can get more information on the hurricane cone at www.hnc.noaa.gov/aboutcone.shtml.  Also, search the NHC website for an explanation of how they determine the hurricane\u2019s direction.",

        "comment info": "HI, @Ms. Britt's Period 1 stats class --\n\nThank you for jumping on \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On In This Graph?\u201d just when the graph was released on Thursday before the Wednesday\u2019s moderation.  \nHere are some suggestions on how to get your wonderings answered.  \nWhy do the circles overlap?  Well, look at how they are made.  To learn about how the radii are determined, you could read the National Hurricane Center\u2019s (NHC) explanation at www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutcone.shtml.  It has to do with 5 years of data and probability.  They use this data to also predict the speed of the hurricane.  There are other graphics the NHC releases that show the arrival time of winds and the warnings.  Any evacuation plans would be based on current data, past data, and local circumstances.\nWhat you can see at the NHC is a use of statistics that can save lives!  \nAre you now intrigued to study to be come a meteorologist?",
