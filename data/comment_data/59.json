Now yes.. age is a common factor but if we put some more funds onto the research aspect i bet we could figure out the abilities of this virus and how possibly we could use the science of CRISPR to possibly \"uncode\" this virus. just a thought. From what i have gathered the virus is a sneaky little bug by only allowing the human body to show symptoms from 7 to 14 days.

Although the virus is not the highest on the chart, surpassing this are the Bird flu at 70%, Smallpox around 40%, Spanish flu, Ebola, etc.    accordingly says about 0.1 through 4% of  people  who get the virus will die. As well one person can spread it from about 1.75 to about three people. One thing I had wondered about at first when seeing this chart was that the virus numbers are not exact like the other diseases. After reading through other comments I have came to the same conclusion as many other's that it is new and people still don't know much about it. And also I feel that these numbers will dwindle down as soon as people get a vaccine. Thank you for reading",

Explaining that because this is a new virus, researchers haven't been able to find a cure yet, like the other viruses have been discovered which they are able to manage and not get out of hand. But leading to the measles and chickenpox, they do not have a specific cure but they have a vaccine which can how prevent the disease but there can be side effects due to the vaccine. This leading to my claim, that because of the new virus, there isn't a cure which could lead to a higher death rate. I wonder if the researchers will be able to find a cure or just be able to use a vaccine like the measles and chickenpox because they are still not sure of how to 100% cure the disease which people can transmit to other people very easily. I would say that this graph is showing that the coronavirus is not as deadly as the measles and chickenpox but it could get out of hand which could lead to a higher death rate and become a serious desiease. But if it is handled correctly and able to be cured, I think this will be a virus that tge world won't be very concerned with.",

For example, if you get the Polio you have less than a 0.1% chance of dying. On the other hand, if you get something like the bird flu, you have a 70% chance of dying. I think the x-axis means that if on eperson gets that disease, how many other people can get infected by that one person with the disease. I don't know if that makes sense, but an example of this is Chikenpox. Chikenpox is the most infectious diesease on the chart and MERS is the least infectious. I agree on not hoarding, guys we can't just think about ourselves we have to think about others and help them fight these diseases, although we are in a health crisis right now, we have to remember that we aren't the only one in this world. We have to take care of each other, and this is our community and if we don't take care of it we will all suffer the same consequences.

I would like to think that this is because it is a newly discovered disease. I am also very surprised by this information because in the news, the coronavirus is often very talked about and warned how deadly and dangerous it could be. My prior information was disregarded when I read this graph. I would like to see how this graph changes after the coronavirus is discovered more in-depth and scientists understand what is happening to individuals that are diagnosed with this disease. I would also like to see where the dot ends up landing, so to speak.",

I noticed that the coronavirus is placed in a red square and not a dot. I think this could be because it is still ongoing and we do not know how many exact fatalities there have been. There are many more pieces of data for the coronavirus than the others on the graph. I noticed that the bird flu has the highest fatality rate on the graph. Most of the diseases have high fatality rates. The coronavirus is still new and ongoing so as of right now it falls between 0.1% and 5% range of fatality. I wonder why I wonder if Coronavirus will become more fatal? A title for this graph could be Coronavirus v  he World.",

I also notice that as the fatality rate of a virus goes up, the average number of people infected seems to decrease. For example, Chicken Pox has a very very low fatality rate, yet it is one of the highest viruses that the average number of people infected is very large. By this graph, you can tell that the coronavirus isn't the virus with the most fatality rate, as the bird flu is much higher.

So far (as the red/pink area indicates the virus is still spreading) shows the fatality rate of this disease is not at the level of an \"extreme\" disease like Ebola, but not at the level of a more common disease like the flu. Seeing this comparison may help reduce the concern of the fatality rates of coronavirus. Many people may not realize that while it is spreading at a rapid rate, it is not extreme as something like the Ebola outbreak.

It has a larger fatality rate than polio, common cold, seasonal flu, and chickenpox, but a smaller fatality rate than Bird Flu, Ebola, MERS, Smallpox, and SARS. The average number of people infected by sick individuals is 2-4 people, suggesting that it\u2018a not as contagious as other common infectious diseases. As a fairly new and unknown disease, the growing stats have reason to cause alarm. The intervals for fatality rate vary greatly, making it seem like the diseases at the top have common fatality rates when they actually vary greatly. MERS and SARS are bold. Maybe they are important in the main claim of the graph. \n2) I wonder why the new coronavirus is represented by a box instead of a singular point like the rest of the infectious diseases. Maybe this is because it is a new disease and the effects are not yet completely known. The fatality rate and how contagious it is can only be estimated at this point in time because it has been constantly changing. I also wonder what allows the new coronavirus to spread so quickly in such a short period of time and how it is related to MERS and SARS. \n3) This graph is showing the most common infectious diseases, comparing them to the new coronavirus by fatality rate and the average number of people infected by those who have it.

It is deadlier than polio and more infectious than the common cold. However, it is less deadly than ebola, and smallpox and less infectious than measles and smallpox. I also notice that there is no set number for fatality rate or infection rate. Instead there is a red highlighted zone where it is thought to be. This shows how little data there still is on this virus. The fact that the zone of uncertainty places the death rate at anywhere from .1% to almost 5% and the infection rate from a little over 1 to almost 3 proves that more research should be done. \n         Due to the uncertainty about this virus, China has imposed a lockdown in Wuhan and surrounding areas to avoid spreading the virus. However, seeing that it is possible that the fatality rate is as low as .1% and that it is less deadly and infectious than most serious diseases makes me wonder if it is worth quarantining entire regions and restricting travel for millions. While there should still be quarantine for those confirmed infected and treatments should be a priority, perhaps the response, which had some adverse effects, like trapping vacationing foreigners in China, was too great. Hopefully, the spread of the coronavirus will soon be slowed and travel to China will be reopened.",

Are statistics the same everywhere?",

Don't you get more ideas when you work together?\n\nWhat do you notice about the pattern of the data points?  As infectious diseases are more contagious, they are more or less deadly?  \n\nBased on what pattern you see, what are your conjectures about why this pattern exists?",

It's baffling to see that something you can protect so easily against is more likely to kill you than anything else.\n\nOne thing that I am curious about is seeing how the coronavirus is quickly rising in the charts when it comes to death rates.",

I notice many different types of diseases and sicknesses on the graph, I notice a fatality rate log scale, and I notice a scale for the # of sick people affected. I notice that the graph has a range from 0% fatality rate to a 100% fatality rate. What do I wonder? I wonder what would happen if the coronavirus becomes so bad that the fatality rate would increase. What's going on in the graph?
