Based on the graph, one can infer that the greatest percentages of people being uncounted for are located in southern states with the exception of Montana. It seems that larger states or more densely populated states have more people that are uncounted. This could be due to the difficulty of counting everyone in a state with such a large population.

I wonder if there is a better way (that is covid safe) to get votes in, since many states seem to be struggling with the mail-in method. This largely impacts me because if not everyone's voices are respresented for votes in the election, this will alter the outcome and affect who is nominated. Also, since not everyone is sumbitting and it would be \ndifficult to predict the expected number for each state, it worries me that it will allow room for fraud in the voting. Everyone's vote truly matters in this election and it is important that everyone tries their best to get their vote in one way or another. A catchy headline could be: \"Make Your Vote Count!\"",

If such a big state is trying to get every person counted for, they have to be missing some people. However, not every state is large. Over half of the other states are quite small and are still uncounted for. I believe that this has to do with their rural counties. Most of the states that are not on track have many small towns and are in the country. This means that the people that live there probably did not want to register or couldn't register. I wonder how some other states have little to none uncounted responses. For example, Idaho is a fairly large state with lots of rural towns but their number for uncounted addresses is extremely low. This has an impact on me because every single person counts in the census. Even though many people may think they don't matter in the grand scheme of things, everything will pile up and soon there will be few people submitting the census.

The third thing I noticed is how no matter how big or small the state was, it still had a high number of unaccounted addresses. The last thing I noticed was how West Virginia had little to no unaccounted addresses to begin with\n   I wonder why some states were able to account more addresses for the census quicker than others. For example, after September 30th, Delaware still had about 3% of addresses unaccounted for while a state bigger than it such as Idaho had close to 0%. I also wonder why it looks like some states had already accounted for many addresses before September 10th. An example would be that on September 10th, Washington had under 10% of states unaccounted for while Montana had way more that 10% unaccounted for. \n   This affects my community because this graph tells me that even now, about 2% of the addresses in my state are not counted for their census.

I wonder as to why people have decided on not doing the census? Is it because they're not supposed to be there? Are they trying to avoid attention on themselves by not doing so. I assume the people who haven't decided on not doing the census are potentially illegal immigrants from other places. Although it's not the entire reason that people aren't doing the census. A huge percentage of a people haven't done it. There's no way for that many illegal people, so what's the deal with not doing the census? I'm curious as to why and it'll be interesting when the rest of the information for this graph comes out. The impact this has on my community is that if the people aren't filling out their census, this will impact us badly later in the future. A headline for this graph could be \"What's up with these states' people not doing their census?\"",

You bring up a great point about it maybe being about COVID-19; many of the states where corona is spreading a lot more, are the same states that aren't on track with the census. Maybe this is because they have a lot going on and are not thinking about the importance of filling the census.",

Additionally, New Jersey is densely populated which most likely creates a more significant impact on the census data.

The grey states must be the states with the least amount of uncounted address which also means that they would be counted more equally. Because the census is important and depends on the state's population, it's important to count as much as the population as we can. This means that the states with the higher graphs would have fewer chances to get represented right. I also noticed how I can't see a graph for Pennsylvania and Road Island, so at least almost all, if not all, of their addresses are being counted.\n-I wonder about the homeless people because they are still people and are a part of the population; however, they may not be counted.\n-This is impactful because I would like for each state to be represented right and every person to be counted. If it's not counted accurately then the representatives won't be fair based on the population.\n-The graphs shows the percentage of addresses that have been counted and it also shows how many states have more than ten percent of uncounted addresses and a few who have much less uncounted addresses.\nI think that a headline could be 'Uncounted and Unrepresented' or something similar.",

Of them, lots of states have a large negative slope. The states that are on track have almost a flat line in terms of addresses uncounted. Also, I noticed that most of the states that are on track to collect responses have smaller populations.\n2.) I wonder if the projected area of the graph is actually accurate. Because this graph went through 9/30, this data is complete now as we are in October and I wonder how it compares. Also, I wonder why so many states are struggling with people filling out the census. Do some states advertise it more than others?\n3.) This impacts me because living in Georgia, we are not only one of the states not on track to collect responses from 99% of addresses, but we are also one of the states with a higher percentage of addresses uncounted. It is important that everyone is counted for because it determines important things such as the number of seats in the Congress for the state. \n4.) This graph shows the percentage of addresses uncounted in every state in the United States organized by where they are located.
