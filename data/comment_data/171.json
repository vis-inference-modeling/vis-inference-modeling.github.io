This makes sense as California, L.A. more specifically, is filled with millions of celebrities, and with this high celebrity presence comes a desire to hear about their life and drama. Celebrity gossip often appears on news channels and outlets. L.A. itself is also a bustling city with a lot going on such as big businesses, movie and tv production, as well as real estate. There is therefore a lot of news to capture and document. I wonder why New York has suffered such a decline in news outlets. I am truly suprised as when I initially looked at this graph I assumed it would have the most news outlets as this is a place I typically associate with news. However now thinking about it and relating this to my community I really only hear local news from New York about the weather and at times my mom watches morning talk shows that air in New York. I associate California more with celebirty gossip and entertainment news.  I beleive that the high celibrity prescense and movie and tv production in CA has a lot to do with the amount of news outlets that they have in comparrison to NY.\nWhat's the news on the U.S.'s news?",

This could be problematic for residents who rely on them for news and information. Interestingly, larger states seem to have more than two local news outlets. This raises the question of why some areas are experiencing a news desertion, and whether communities are being adversely affected by this trend. It's essential to consider this issue and find ways to address it, as access to local news can be critical for fostering an informed and engaged citizenry.",

Another observation is many of the states that voted blue in the presidential election have a larger number of news outlets than those that voted red. I wonder how access to news affects voter activity. It would make sense for dense areas to have diverse views and less predictable voting habits.

This affects me in my community because I live in New Jersey where most counties have two to five local news stations or even 10 plus. This is important because it allows us to get information from the local news that strictly applies to us and lets us know what is happening around us. \n\u201cWho still needs the local news?

California, New York, and Florida have the biggest populations in the country and seem to get some of the most coverage as well. However, what I wonder is why Texas seems to have so few since they have such a large population. Is it just the major cities getting more news? Are the smaller counties being left out? Additionally, how New York City lost so many new outlets since 2005 was a shock, because they are the most populated city in the United States. Are there possibly too many news outlets in that area? This relates to my community because New Jersey seems to actually be one of the only states with almost all counties containing new outlets. I do wonder what the cause of this may be though. Is it because it is so close to New York City? Finally, what is going on in this graph is it is trying to display how some of the less populated states in the country don't get as much news coverage, especially when it is seen that a lot of the major counties get twice as much and are heard about the more then others. \nCatchy Headline:\nLocal news out, National news in!",

This makes sense since many rural areas lack internet access, and even electricity. Coming from New York, I've observed more news outlets, likely because of the higher population density. Southern California, with its large population, also has numerous news outlets. I'm curious about how Starlink and satellites could improve internet access for everyone. If there are genuinely unbiased news outlets, it could help educate more people in the Midwest about global events. This matters to my community, as having accurate information and a well-educated population can lead to progress in various aspects of our world.",

    "comment info": "In this graph, it is displaying the amount of news outlets within the counties of states across the U.S. When looking at the graph, I noticed that generally, on the northeast coast and west coast, the states have a greater amount of news outlets. However, in the middle of the country, there appears to be significantly more counties with none. I think that this is caused by the differences in populations between the states. Since southern and western states are more rural whereas states on the coasts are more urban, they have less dense populations compared to coastal states, leading to less news outlets. But, in states such as California and New York which have the most local news outlets, their more densely populated cities require more news coverage for the greater number of people. Additionally, I think that California and New York have so many news outlets because many news networks are based in these states. I wonder why Texas has very few news outlets since it has a large population. I think this may be caused by Texas having the largest number of counties amongst all U.S. states so it might be difficult to cover them all. This relates to my community because it is important that news outlets aren\u2019t lost as they help us to stay informed.

Based on the color coding, there is a common trend in this graph: the amount of local news outlets across the US is declining. I observe that rural and less densely populated counties have fewer local news outlets. There may be a few contributing factors to this statistic: these areas have a lack of Internet, there are fewer viewers, and there are not many newsworthy events occurring. For example, Los Angeles County has the most local news outlets. LA has a high population density and is an urbanized area. Local news outlets will get more attention than in a county with very few people who are all spread apart. LA is a city that always has the spotlight due to the media. News is a big industry there because there is always content to write about and it can travel in seconds through the internet. Celebrities, scandals, and tragedies are daily occurrences. This captivating content attracts so many viewers because people love gossip. In LA, there is always something new to write about. However, in Northwest Arctic, Alaska where only 7000 people live, it is harder to find things to write about that will get people\u2019s attention. I wonder if counties that are so small like this don\u2019t need news stations because there are so few people that local news just travels by word of mouth.

While numerous counties have either one or zero news outlets, the Northeast region news outlets remain afloat for now. Most of its counties contain between two and ten news outlets, but these numbers are still significantly less than they were twenty years ago. I am curious about the news outlets in the West. California and Arizona are still thriving, but the news outlets in Utah are endangered. Discrepancies in population could be an explanation for this. Maybe states with higher populations contain more news outlets, except Texas contradicts this trend. This influences my community as the decline in journalism impacts the economy, with numerous individuals now losing their jobs. Additionally, a lack of news creates a lack of knowledge among the American population. I would title this graph: \u201cThe Decline of Journalism.\u201d",

The color scale emulates the amount of local news outlets in each county; dark orange being none and dark green being 10+. I noticed that it appears a majority of the counties fall under light orange, with only one local news source. This is could be directly related to the population density of that area. For example, most counties in the state of California appear light to dark green, while most counties in Texas are light to dark orange. California has a higher population density than Texas and greater urbanized areas. While Texas is very spread out, there still are 29 counties that lack any news outlets. Texas has also become a hub of more controversial takes within state and local government. With the lack of news outlets, I wonder how people both in those 29 counties retrieve facts. Do they rely on only one news source from outside their county? Do they rely on social media or word of mouth? How much misinformation and or miscommunication are they subjected to? In my community, while we do have multiple sources of news, I see how fast misinformation can manifest, spread, and destroy. It is concerning how quickly people can believe so easily what they hear or read without fact checking. With social media becoming a \u201cnews source\u201d to many, I am concerned about how this could affect politics in the upcoming national election. \n\n\u201cThe Death of Journalism In America\u201d",

As someone living on Long Island, it may not seem like a large concern because it has plenty of news outlets; however, journalism is in decline across the country. New York has lost over 200 news outlets, and it seems likely that it will continue to lose more.

This trend is demonstrated in the more western states. I wonder if this is because there is not as much news needed to be covered, and news spreads faster amongst people in small communities (not a need for many local news outlets). The number of local news sources to population density might explain why high-population states like California, New York and Pennsylvania typically have 10+ news outlets. This may be because a greater population requires a larger number of local news sources to spread information and cover more stories. Also, population density might contribute to Texas\u2019 lack of county news outlets despite its large population. As the western portion of Texas is less populated, there are fewer local news outlets in this area. In general, I wonder if people focus more on national and international news as social media and other forms of communication make local information more readily available. Is this a trend that could lead to greater loss of local news outlets, like in the New York City metropolitan area? The graph relates to me as local news is something that directly impacts my community. The decline of local news sources can spread misinformation or lead to a lack of knowledge in the American public.

Counties with smaller populations, like in Alaska and most of the middle states have much fewer new outlets in their counties. It makes sense that Florida, California and New York have some of the most new outlets, because I see a lot of news from counties in those states. Those states hold lots of major events and are heavily populated.\n\n2. I wonder how much this graph has changed from ten, twenty, or thirty years ago. Was there a lot more new outlets in our past? Were they more or less spread out? I also wonder how more or less new outlets in an area impacts a community. I wonder if people have different opinions based on how many new sources they have relating to their community. Do people with fewer/no news outlets near them struggle to stay informed, or do they always rely on news coming from other counties?\n\n3. This relates to me and my community because my community has a good amount of news outlets (2-5) so I can get educated about what is happening near me from various sources, giving me more than one opinion on events. I also live near a more popular city with 10+ news outlets, so I can see major/state events from those news sources. Having more sources in my community helps me stay informed, whereas in a community with less, I could less news, slower and potentially biased.\n\n4.

In many small towns, everyone knows everyone, so relevant news travels fast without the need for a news outlet.

However, in much bigger cities, such as New York City or Los Angeles, the number of news outlets are more proportional to the number of citizens- that being, a larger number of news production outlets \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder how this graph can harm or hinder the interests of family-ownded news production companies that may reside in larger urban areas.

I would think this is the case because the crime in Kalmazoo is not proportinal to the crime in Lansing or Ann Arbor.

This is shown by the evident differences in the green (10+ new source areas) areas on the map. \nTexas has the least amount of news sources available overall with 29 counties not having any at all (as stated by the graph) \nMost counties seem to have a range of 2-5 news outlets or less as shown by the plentiful light blue and red squares. \n\n2. I wonder why so many counties do not have many local news sources available to them (Is it a lack of funds or lack of interest?). I wonder if the lack of local news sources is due to the wide availability of national news sources due to technology. I wonder if a lack of local news sources is harmful to the population. I wonder why Texas has the least news sources and California has the most. \n\n3. According to the map my community also has in the 2-5 range of local news sources so we are averages for the entire country\nPersonally, I do not follow a lot of local news sources and instead opt for the more national news sources because I want to read bigger stories that have nationwide or worldwide impacts rather than just local events, for good or for bad, which could be similar to what other people turn towards.  \n\n4.

Furthermore, the tri-state area has one of the highest concentrations of local news, making a possible connection to cities a major factor in regard to the prominence of local information. Lastly, the Midwest lacks local news outlets, which could be attributed to the more rural nature.\n- How has social media affected the rate at which local news has dropped? In addition, I wonder how the culture within the states has affected the local news rate, with Texas being divided in terms of local news and minimal local news. I wonder why California has the most local news outlets, considering the fact that it is the hub for mainstream media and has Silicon Valley.\n- This relates to me and my community, with journalism and local news being popular interests. As seen through the newspaper club and journalism classes, it is concerning that those industries may become harder and harder to follow as a passion as they fall out of relevancy within communities. Furthermore, the lack of local outlets will make it exponentially more difficult to spread information, with social media not being the most reliable, leading to urgent news more than likely falling on deaf ears.\n- A Local or National Newsflash?

According to the graph States like Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, etc. have many counties without news outlets or only one. In fact Texas has 29 counties without news outlets. I wonder how huge outliers like major cities such as New York City ,and Los Angeles affect the mean of news outlets. Many communities across the globe have little to no voice to tell their stories due to the lack of news outlets. During my time spent in Far Rockaway NY, which is mostly lower income and predominantly African American, I noticed many things wouldn't make the news as it would in other neighborhoods. Various acts like murder, theft, or even fundraisers to give back to the community wouldn't get the recognition it deserves. This led to no reforms for violence and the good being overlooked.

This doesn't affect my community nor relate because in general all around the world news spreads digitally so there isn't much need for new outlets anymore although the thought is nice. A catchy headline is \"News outlets are now abandoned\"",

        "comment info": "@Jeanelle Fajardo I agree with your question asking why people do not pay attention to the journalism world. This is a significant issue because when news outlets start to disappear, more people will probably turn to social media as a source of information. While newspapers are not always an accurate source, I believe that misinformation and propaganda spread quickly on social media platforms.",

One thing that does shock me is that there are most news outlets in what seems to be the capitals of each state. I understand the importance of our state's capitals, but are multiple news outlets required?\n\n2. Building on question 1, why do our state's capitals receive so much media attention? Government and politics are important, but not the only noteworthy thing the news covers. Are our state's capitals more interesting because they are involved with government, or is it highly covered because it is a high profile area?\n\n3. Since I live in a smaller town, not much happens around here that is very noteworthy. Thus, local news has never interested me as much as national news. Normally, local news isn't covering events that would impact me, really only the weather. \n\n4. Is local news becoming obsolete? \"News deserts\" becoming increasingly common throughout America.",

That highlights how people from smaller towns, which generally seem to be towards the inner country, do not care for news outlets. Perhaps that can be an explanation as to why news outlets are disappearing there.",

I was surprised to see that all of Long Island had 10+ outlets. I wonder when you say that everyone knows whats happening in your area could be effected by other areas who have no idea what is happening in their community and how that could be dangerous for multiple safety reasons.",

    "comment info": "This is a topic that is very near to my heart. I teach at a small rural school in Lee County, Va., but my grandfather, grandmother, father, mother, aunts, uncles, and brothers all work for our local newspapers (it's family owned).  That particular newspaper has been established since 1920s. But even my family and I realize that local papers are almost impossible to maintain in rural areas for many reasons (size of readership, moving to digital content, larger papers (looking at you NYT), shrinkage of ad revenue, etc.) I don't know how long our papers will continue, but we all see the writing on the wall. \n\nA local paper does so much to check and inform its community. I know it's not exciting to post a water rate hike, or a change in zoning from residential to commercial, but those are the things that impact directly on the people. Without those postings that are required, there can be corruption without anyone knowing what is going on. Your graph makes it obvious that many rural places have no local news. \n\nI've grown up in a paper family. It's a thankless job a lot of the time. But some of my fondest memories are about putting a paper to bed and delivering them with my dad around our county.",

I presume your paper is in one of the light orange Virginia counties on the map.  \n\nHave you read Dan Kennedy and Ellen Clegg\u2019s new book \u201cWhat Works in Community News\u201d?  They have been looking at local newspapers for years and have explored what is working.  Maybe you have some insights you may want to share with them, if you haven\u2019t already.  \n\nCurious.  I wonder -- How does voter participation compare in your county to other rural counties in Virginia?  If it was greater that would be reasonable proof of the benefit of a free press to support our democracy!",
