While yes, smaller states have more power in the senate, larger states have more power in the house of representatives. This is because we have a bicameral house that favors both smaller states and larger states. If you were to effectively remove the smaller states power and base vote power off of population in the senate, you might as well have just one house of representatives. It would mess up the balance of power and smaller states would have no choice but to do what the larger states ask. Rather this bicameral system finds the best of both worlds by making sure both population and small states both agree on a bill before passing it. No change is needed.",

This means that a Senator in a smaller state may be voted in by a higher percentage of white people versus a large state which has a more diverse make-up of voters. \nWhat I wonder?\nI wonder how this affects which party is going to win based on the racial and ethnic makeup of voters in each state. I also wonder how this affects the senate and how the Senators may cooperate or butt heads based on what they promised the citizens of their state.  \nHow this relates to my community?\nThis relates to my community because I come from a state with a large population and a diverse makeup. I wonder how the diversity in my state will affect the senate race. \nMy headline: \"Voter Diversity in the Senate\"",

California has a very large population so it's harder for individual voices to be expressed by only 2 senators. \n\n2.

What impact does this have on you and your community?\nMassachusetts isn\u2019t shown on the graph, but we have about 6.9 million citizens. Connecticut is shown on the graph and they have about half the population we do. I would say if Massachusetts was on the graph we would have about 12 voters equaling 1 Wyoming voter.

To vote you must be an American citizen and unfortunately, this is a far reach for many immigrants.\n\n3) How does this relate to you and your community? This relates to my community and me because I am part of the Hispanic community which is one of the minorities that is voting. I think more Hispanic people would vote if they had citizenship. I know this because I live in a predominantly Hispanic community and am aware that some Hispanic people wish to be more involved but have limitations. \n\nHeadline: Who Represents Humans?",

I don't think it would make sense if one state that has a significant difference in population, has the same votes as another state. For example Idaho and Texas, Texas has a much larger population which means that it should have more votes. I think this because they need to represent more people than say Idaho would. I also notice that race is also recorded in this graph. It shows how many of the given votes are people that are white, black, asian, hispanic, or another race. In Cali. It shows that the majority were hispanic, maybe this shows that quite a bit of their population is hispanic. Where in Connecticut's votes were made up of mostly white humans. \n\n2:  I wonder what the other states are going to be on the left side of the graph.

When looking at the data more closely, I can see that California compared to Connecticut, Alabama, and Michigan has a much smaller percentage of black voters. With 59 voters in California there are only 3 voters who are black while in Alabama there are 7 voters with 2 who are black. I also noticed that while in all the other states, white voters make up the majority, in California the majority is made up of Hispanic voters.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\n\nWhy are black people not as represented in California compared to some of the other states shown?\nWhy don\u2019t states have more of an equal representation of ethnicities rather than being majorly white? Or in California\u2019s case, majorly Hispanic.\nI wonder if the \u201cother\u201d category is made up of multiple ethnicities or just one, and if so, why they weren\u2019t just stated like the other rather than generalizing them into \u201cother\u201d.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to my community and I because everyone has somewhat of a say in terms of what happens, for example, electing government officials.

This relates to me and my community because I live in a diverse, mostly hispanic community so it would be interesting to see the representation of voters compared to other states. I think my community could have more hispanic voters like California, but may not have too much of others because not everyone knows about voting or not everyone can.

In Wyoming one white person voting equals 59 diverse ethnicities voting in Congress, it shows that Wyoming has a lower population which is why one vote would mean so much more from Wyoming as compared to one vote in California. Not that voting isn't important if you live in a larger state.\n2) This graph makes me wonder about how necessary one vote truly is. Wyoming has an incredibly influential vote because it has a lower population than areas such as California and New York which have millions of people. I'm not saying to not go vote, if you can vote you should, but it gets you thinking of the population and the effect of your vote.\n3) This relates to my community because it shows how influential one vote can be during the election.

The weight of a single vote in Wyoming is much heavier than one in California due to Wyoming being a much smaller state. I've noticed that the number of representatives varies by state size. Connecticut has only 6 registered voters, whereas California has 59 registered voters. White voters seem to have much more voting power in almost all these states, and in the smaller states, the voter representation is just white. Furthermore, it shows that white voters outnumber all other races, with the exception of California, where Hispanic voters outnumber White voters.\n2. I wonder what causes white people to be the majority in the largest number of these states, even in diverse ones. Is this the population mostly white in these states or are white voters just more privileged? \n3. This can relate to my community because I feel similar to California, Hispanics would probably be a majority of voters in New Jersey. Although most of us are immigrants I don't know if they all would be registered to vote.

This is rather disproportionate.  Another thing that sticks out is how in the other mentioned states, besides California, White voters hold the majority.  California's majority is Hispanic; California is also the most diverse with various ethnicities represented.  I wonder what accounts for these differences in diversity within these states.  Do the politics of these states have the largest effect on their diversity?

However, I do wonder why this is considering the fact that different states have much bigger populations than Wyoming which you would think would give it more voting power. This graph is similar to my community. In my neighborhood, there is a board that in this case represents the Senate. Each person on that board has a vote that counts as one. The size difference here can be used as the longer the person has lived in my community. It doesn't matter how long they have lived there, they will have the same vote as everyone else. This graph is showing how size does not matter. No matter how big some states are compared to others the power each one has will be the same. This rule was created back in the 1700s when America became its own country and that's how it has been run since. Each state has the same amount of power as all the others.

Also, I wonder why is Wyoming is the benchmark state that is being compared? Why is Wyoming so special (in this instance)? I wonder what the implication of this data model is. What is the purpose? Are these data people trying to imply that the Senate should be based on proportional representation? Assuming this was the case, that there was this thing in the constitution called the Connecticut Comprise in the late 1700s that created a bicameral legislature to ensure that we would have two divisional legislative bodies in which one worked in accordance to the needs of lesser populated states (The Senate, everyone is equal regardless of size) and then of course there is the congress where the number of seats is determined by the number of population.",

It was very surprising to see that one white voter in Wyoming is equal to 59 voters of different ethnic groups in California. Is this uneven representation in the Senate just? White voters have greater representation than minority groups in all states shown in the visual. I imagine that this is because of population, but I wonder what impact that disparity has on representation when it comes to actual action. I notice that the larger the state\u2019s population, the harder it is to be represented. I also wonder what the visuals would look like for other major states in the U.S., like Florida or New York.

There is no comparison of white voters in Wyoming to voters of any other race in North Dakota -- are their votes so small they are negligible? In addition, I notice that although some states have higher numbers of voters than others, the proportion of white, black, Hispanic, or other voters in these states are different. \nThen again, the word 'Hispanic' is doing a lot of work here. 'Hispanic' does not function as a racial category in the way that 'black' or 'white' does -- there are white Hispanics and black Hispanics, for example. Why not consolidate these groups into their respective racial categories, and keep separate those Hispanics who do not fall under either white or black? \nOne other thing I wonder about is that these counts are based off of populations, and not necessarily voter turnout. I think about this because in a number of these states there are many restrictions to voting (that often affect BIPOC people disproportionately to white people) that could drastically affect these figures. What proportion of the black voters in California are in prison? What proportion of the indigenous voters in North Dakota cannot vote due to a lack of photo identification? This figure does not answer these questions.\nIn my state, the carceral system is majorly made up of blacks and Hispanics. These people cannot vote -- the population of Florida doesn't represent them.",

This is especially poignant as elections are approaching and a contested race for Senate that will affect many Pennsylvanians lives is occuring.

It is quite frightening that in our \u201cequal\u201d society our votes can count as 1/59th of another person's vote. Each senator has the same amount of power, so one person in Wyoming has as much say over the course of our country as many more Pennsylvanians.  If a regular person has more power to influence the government than another, that disregards democracy as a concept. However, I am scared that if enough radicals vote, many women\u2019s basic rights to bodily autonomy could be in danger due to this inequality, not just in my state, but across the country. \n\nThe Inequality of \u201cEqual Representation\u201d",

I suspect that the disproportionately large increase in Hispanic representation in California has a lot to do with California's carceral system. In the census data likely used for these figures, prison populations are likely included. However, not only are prison populations disproportionately black and Hispanic, California has one of the largest relative prison populations in the United States.
