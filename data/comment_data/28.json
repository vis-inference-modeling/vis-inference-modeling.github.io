And my thoughts are as followed in the category of including streaming I will believe R&B/hip-hop has a large percentage over the other genres because music has changed.  Times have changed.  You have so many new artists that are being produced from the R&B/hip-hop genre.  It is a mass production of music that is being produced so fast from those two genres R&B/hip-hop that you can search and stream their genre of music. \n\nThe R&B/hip-hop outweighs the other genres by a large percentage on the [including streaming] because at this day and time it seems to me that this genre of music is in high demand.  So here is a faster way to get it by streaming it. \n\nNow, on the other hand, the rock genre in the traditional sales only bracket is leading the pack with a fair percentage.  I think it is leading the pack because the simple word is right there traditional. I believe that rock music traditionally is winning or leading the pack by sales Because it is a genre of music that people have been listening to for years. Now when you say traditional sales only. I would like to know.  Does that include digital downloads and physical copies, whether it is vinyl or compact disc?",

The main audience of Hip-Hop is the youth, who have moved away from physical sales and onto online sales. This will inevitably lead to the end of the traditional market as this youthful generation will take the place of the old, pushing away their ideals and implementing their own. The question is whether this phenomenon will make a positive or negative impact and if it will affect our everyday lives in the near future.\n\n2. Something interesting that I've noticed is how many rappers are on the streaming list but almost none on the traditional sales list. This lets me look at the differences between these artists and why. Eminem, in particular, makes his appearance only in the list of traditional sales and Drake only makes his on online streaming. This demonstrates the difference in the audience, especially their age. Drake obviously appeals to a much younger generation that Eminem's, who hit his prime arguably in the early 2000s, while Drake is the top today. The youth are leading the frontier of the music industry and will inevitably lead to online streaming taking over altogether.",

At the same time the same soundtrack for top place in the sales also is in the top 3 for streaming. Soundtracks seem to be relatively popular for traditional sale but \"The Greatest Showman: Original Soundtrack\" seems to b that rarity where it is very popular on both sides on the sales and streaming areas.\n2. Another thing that seems questionable is how the Hip Hop/R&B genre is not the most sold genre in traditional sales despite its popularity in streaming which is more than half. The Rock genre is actually the one that sales the most traditionally more than likely because there is a favorable amount of people who enjoy rock music equally through streaming and actual listening devices.

I look at how the Black Panther album is in the top 10 and so is \"The Greatest Showman\" album while the Black Panther album is more centered around hip hop it does not reach the top 10 in hard copy sales and \" The Greatest Showman\" shoots up to the number 1 spot in hard copy sales, why is that they are both movie albums but one is a more successful album than the other?",

Allowing an easy way to their music gives them high streaming numbers compared to other genres. Younger views are again sucked into the world of social media because they constantly have a new video or song to listen too.

It seems reasonable to predict that the newer generation dominates the digital (streaming sales) sales and the older generation dominates traditional sales because older music reminds the older generation of their past and newer music seems creative and intriguing to the ears of the newer generation. Keeping a record of music consumption by genre over the years helps people better understand just how rapidly the world evolves and how quickly a trend comes by and goes in a loop.  \n2. The major thing that has caught my attention from the very beginning is the large consumption of the R&B/HIP-POP genre for the streaming section of the graph because then I can correlate just how much of an impact digital sales makes a difference. Traditional sales include mainly older generations that enjoy old fashioned methods of listening and buying their music but when streaming is added into the mix, then more of the newer generation is represented because they go on their phones more often and do not bother with the hassle of inserting CDs or types of vinyl when they can do it all at the push of a button on their screen or keyboard. I would like more information about the groups that dominate the streaming and the traditional sales of the graph so that I can determine if background plays a role in all of this.",

So we see these 2000s teens stick to their roots and buy their rock music how they use to because that is what they know how to do. While now rock has become an almost dead genre only really offering nostalgia to those 2000s teens and adults and it has paved the way to the newer generation getting involved with R&B/HIP-HOP.

Is the higher frequency of streamed R&B caused by its mostly free nature and its listeners being age groups lacking money? In retrospect, the answer being yes wouldn't be that shocking, seeing as I myself am actually streaming music via the Internet right now. Furthermore, those who enjoy classic rock, which peaked in the 1980s, would probably prefer hard copies as nostalgia or just a lack of experience with technology.

    "comment info": "It is interesting to notice that the sales among genres are more even when it is bought traditionally.  R&B/Hip-hop evidently takes up the majority of the streaming.  This is probably because it is generally the younger generation that is using streaming services, and this genre of music is most popular among young people.  It is also interesting to see that rock music is the most popular genre of music bought traditionally, yet it is one of the least popular genres to be streamed.  I wonder why country is so unpopular in both charts.  A good title for this graph would be \"The Impact of Young People on the Music Industry\"",

You offered many reasons why it seems that streaming is taking over traditional music sales:  the age of music lovers, all music is not released in stores, and the use of Bluetooth rather than disc players.

As everything is slowly transitioning to a digital form and this generation has grown up glued to technology, I believe that hip-hop, being a more recent genre, may only keep the throne online while traditional sales continue to be ruled by rock. In addition, I do believe it's entirely possible hip-hop will be surpassed as most streamed. Top genres change with time. Rock and roll used to be popular in the 1950's, inspiring other genres like glam rock, prominent (especially in the UK) during the 1970's, and alternative/emo/punk rock in early 2000's. As the 2010's hit, hip-hop finally dethroned the trend, and, soon, a similar thing will probably happen.",

However, there are still some oldies out there that prefer to listen to their music in the purest form; the physical copy. These people usually range from more adults to fewer teens and adolescents because adults spend more time using the radio, CD player, cassette with self-recorded music, vinyl, etc., to listen to their music. Regardless of the differences between the digital and traditional sales of music, as the world changes new genres will emerge and will resonate with that generation and so forth. For most people out there, music is timeless and sends someone on a trip to memory lane or to emotion lane or both.

    "comment info": "The graph above displays how individuals consumed music in 2018 according to genre. It juxtaposes traditional sales of music, being sales and radio play, with both traditional sales and streaming. For exclusively traditional sales, I notice that the genre of music listened to/purchased was dispersed relatively evenly, with R&B/Hip-Hop at 20%, Pop at 23%, Rock at 33% and country at 14%. However, I noticed that for traditional sales coupled with streaming, the distribution is more uneven; R&B/Hip-Hop takes the lead at 54%, followed by Pop at 19%, Rock at 13%, and country at 9.5%. I think the disparity in music consumption is due to different listeners. Streaming is a new way of listening to music, and is thus largely embraced by predominantly younger audiences. Younger people, such as teenagers much like myself, tend to gravitate towards R&B/Hip-Hop. Contrairly, older listeners typically aren\u2019t as \u201cwith the times\u201d and tech savvy, so they often enjoy music how they always have -- through traditional sales of purchasing, for instance, CDs, as opposed to streaming online. I think that it is because younger people tend to stream and listen to R&B/Hip-Hop that the music consumption differs widely. Plus, depending on how much music one listens to, streaming can also be more cost effective regardless of age. I wonder what the white boxes toward the end of the bars account for? \n\nTitle: Millennials and Music: Streaming is the Next Big Thing",

My main wonder is where is this data coming from? is it all of the us or just specific parts of the us because this could have a effect on what type of music people listen to as music preferences tend to change depend on location.

This question, is one I have for those who prefer Hip-Hop music to other genres such as Country. It seems that music preference has shifted from quality of the words being said, to the beat that the lyrics are set to. As an avid listener of country music, I can honestly say that I appreciate this genre for the lyrics and wholesome messages that it portrays. But, I can say that the beat of the song can ruin the entire message. With this being said, I can see why music has shifted from content of the message to the beat itself. While I do enjoy listening to \"Mo Bamba,\" I do not find much quality in the song other than the beat it is set to. Music preference has shifted through the years, and in today's society, music is being streamed and listened to based on the way it sounds. Since electronics have played a large part in music, the sounds and beats are those that could have never been produced 20 years ago. For this reason, I feel that people are choosing to listen to what is ~new and different.~ \n\nWith apps such as Spotify and Apple Music, it comes as no surprise to me that the consumption percentages are what they are. Younger consumers, especially teenagers, are turning to Apple Music and Spotify to listen to their favorite songs without actually purchasing them. Paying $10 a month to stream unlimited amounts of music makes much more sense than paying for each individual download.",

There was nothing better than jamming out to Taylor Swift on my Hello Kitty CD player. However, even more-so, I am amazed. It is astonishing that people are now able to play music at the tap of a finger.\nIn regards to the percentages, it is no shock to me that rap music consusmes more than half of the total. If you look at the Billboard Top-100, you will see that most of the songs are by rappers, such as Travis Scott, A-Boogie-Wit-Da-Hoodie, and Drake. I feel that this high percentage may be a contributing factor as to why violent is so prevalent in society today. A lot of these songs discuss murder, gangs, etc. If people are constantly listening to this, it's not going to inspire them to establish world peace. However, I can't say I'm not a fan of rap!\nIt's interesting that traditional sales are pretty much evenly distributed among genres. Rock has more sales than rap and pop (which are typically favorites of the younger crowd). This leads me to infer that it is primarily an older crowd who is still purchasing CDs, perhaps due to the fact that they've grown up on it and it's what they're used to.",

Because Spotify and Pandora play music that they think you would like- not only based on your preferences, but also based on the Top 50 Hit List- I slowly began to listen to pop and country music less and less. I notice that R&B music consumption is at 54% for streaming, while only at 20% for traditional sales. Modern rappers are taking advantage of this new outlet and increasing their audience. I wonder if my music taste has assimilated to the culture, and if I am doing Carrie Underwood and Lady Gaga, for example, a disservice by no longer purchasing their music.

    "comment info": "The traditional sales including streaming bar graph depicts a large percentage listening to R&B and Hip Hop. On the other hand, traditional sales only show that rock is dominating by a slight margin. It is quite noticeable that hip hop songs, like Drake, Post Malone and Cardi B dominates the charts given above. However, only Post Malone and Travis Scott is within the top of both streaming included and not included. I am extremely curious to why rock dominates traditional sales excluding streaming. Currently, many of the hit songs are hip hop or R&B, but the sales prove it is rock. Which raises an eyebrow considering the time period we are in. What may be going in this graph is a restriction upon which songs the radio can play. For example, Cardi B\u2019s Privacy Invasion. Noticing the content of her previous songs, this may also have lewd themes and curse words. The radio may not play this song because of young children being part of the audience. With that being said, it is possible that is why traditional sales excluding streaming is a lot lower with the percentage of hip hop. Another headline for this can be \u201cRestriction on Radio causes Diversity in Genres.\u201d",

It might be that users for spotify and other streaming services are used more by younger people. I can't think of many kids my age who listen to the radio other than when they're in the car with their parents. \n\nAlso, rap isn't rap without swearing unless the song didn't have swearing in the first place, so it is difficult to play on the radio.
