In 1950, the average age of world leaders seemed to be around 62, whereas in 2020, it seems to have dropped to around 52.  The spread in ages of world leaders does not seem to have changed though, as the spread appears to be around 20 years above and below the average across all years. Another thing I noticed is that Republican U.S. presidents appear to generally be older than Democrat U.S. presidents, as most of the republican presidents are above the trend line and most democrat presidents are below the trend line in age. \nI wonder why Republican presidents tend to be older than Democrat presidents, and I also wonder if there are distinct differences in ages based on parties for other countries. I wonder what may explain these differences in age based on party affiliation, and if age could somehow be correlated to presidential election winners based on party. I also wonder if the trend line is statistically significant in the model.\nThis impacts my community and me as it shows that in general, world leaders have been younger and younger over the years, as this could perhaps impact who a candidate may relate to most. \n\u201cChanges in Average Ages of World Leaders Over Time\u201d",

I also notice in terms of the United States, Republican presidents tend to be older on average than Democratic presidents. However in general, it appears the overall trend is that the ages of leaders across the world is decreasing. I wonder what they faded arrows in the background represent. There are many more of them but I am unsure to what their purpose is. This relates to me and my community especially now in May, 2024 because it is an election year, so it is interesting to see the trends of the ages of our presidents as they are the head of the nation. \nHeadline: \"Head of a Nation: Is Youth the Way to Go?\"",

Whether or not that is true, it is interesting to see that that has, in fact, happened before, and even to a further extent with Churchill being 80 when elected. I also noticed that Democratic leaders are typically younger than Republican voters. \nI wonder if the reasoning for this is calculated to bring the votes of younger people, as the younger demographics tend to lean more left than older demographics. \nThis trend directly impacts the world, as the age of leaders changes a nation's stability and power.\nHeadline: \"Is the State of Our Nation Actually Getting Younger?\"",

I also noticed that the elected presidents of the more recent years are older than the previous presidents. I am curious as to why the elected presidents of the past 40 years are so much older than before, and I wonder what the unlabeled grey lines represent. This data impacts my community because as the average age of American presidents goes up, there may be a disconnect between the American citizens and their president. The president may make choices that align with their values, but their values will most likely seem \"outdated\" and not reflect the current opinions of younger Americans who make up a lot of our country's population.

I  wonder if there are going to be presidents who are a bare minimum of age restriction(35).  I also think that people should be more interested in President's leaders. I also think that that more people would elect older runners for president because they would have more experience and would be more smarter.

Based on the gray arrows, it also seems like the youngest leader of a democratic nation is well below the age of forty, and the oldest leader of a democratic nation well over the age of eighty. \nI wonder why the average age has a downward trend, as shown by the trend line. I wonder how age relates - if at all - to the way that democratic leaders govern their nation. I also wonder whether age affects the nation's views of the president/PM, and if it plays in a role in voting. I wonder how this graph would compare if leaders of non-democratic nations were included. Since elected democrats tend to be younger than elected republicans, I wonder why that is. Is it because conservative and liberal ideals appeal differently between generations? \nThis impacts my community because if age correlates to the decisions that leaders make in office, then if affects us, the population that they're governing.

I also noticed that Republican leaders tend to be older than the democratic leaders. Lastly, I also noticed that the trend seems to be going down which shows that maybe the leaders are getting elected at a younger age. \nI wonder why Republican leaders seem to be older than Democratic leaders when elected? Maybe it has to do with the assumption that Republicans rather an elderly or older person to be their leader because they have more experience than younger ones which usually result in more conservative ideas\nThis impacts my community because it shows that in America our two presidential candidates are older in age which may affect the way they run things/ if they will live throughout their whole terms.

In examining the trends, the United States Presidents seem to not really follow any trend. I also think it is interesting that most prime ministers are all above the age of 65 besides the Canada Prime Minister. I wonder why it is so common for older men and women to want to run for office. Is it because candidates assume the most votes will go to the older candidate because they appear to be wiser? It appears nowadays that most young candidates in the US usually never get far when running for president. There might be a correlation between the stereotypical idea of a president being older which causes citizens to feel uneasy with a younger president. \nThis impacts my community because as the millennials and generation z begin to get older, it appears we agree more with younger, more progressive candidates. If most head of governments appear to be older, our voices and opinions might not be heard. Because these generations grew up in times of social media and these modern times, our views on a lot of issues differ greatly than the older generations. \nHeadline: \"As Millennials and Generation Z Age, Will We See Younger Candidates\"",

Some special cases when it comes to age range are Churchill, Kennedy, Trump and Biden with most of them much older and 1 of them much younger than the trend. One thing worth noticing is how the term of other countries leaders are much longer than Us president's term. The line of Thatcher and Merkel are a lot longer compare to the line of the presidents\n\nWhat do you wonder?

Democrats tend to take office slightly younger than other world leaders, however, Biden would be an exception to this and would actually be the oldest person on this graph if he were elected. There is a large range of ages, from about 42 to 76. I wonder why republicans tend to take office at an older age. I also wonder if there's an age where someone would be too old to be president - there's a minimum age requirement, why isn't there a maximum? This impacts me and my community because both candidates in our upcoming election are unusually old. I hope they will listen to the voices of the younger generations. It's also scary if one of them were to pass while in office because it would lead to chaos and disarray. A catchy headline would be \"Where do we Draw the Line?: President's Ages\"",

In other words, this graph shows how the democratic candidates throughout the years have been either slightly or significantly older than the republican side. The graph also shows that since 1950 the age that candidates are elected is going down. I wonder what if this trend will keep going down and that if at one point we could see a 35 year old president, the smallest number you must be to run. This affects my community by showing how the candidates are getting younger and younger, meaning they could be seen as better people to the youth or more relatable but as not equal to older generations. This graph easily shows the difference between ages of Democrat and republican candidates throughout the past 70 years.

The Democratic Party shows the trend of their Presidents becoming younger with time, while Republicans remain 55 years old or older. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nDoes the Democratic Party want to represent the younger generations more by picking younger candidates (excluding Biden). \n \nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nA divide between the younger generations and older generations will continue unless representation of both age groups occurs. Younger political members, like AOC, are generally hated amongst the older population from seeming like they know nothing, while the younger people love to see someone they could possibly connect to. Older political leaders appreciation is then flipped, with the older population loving a leader near their age and the younger people believing the leader is \"delusional\".
