Also, the larger percent of entry at 9.7% comes at the age of 3 with percentages going down after that age I also notice in the second table that the majority of DACA eligible workers work in fairly good paying jobs with not as much physical labor such as in sales or in an office space while DACA ineligible workers work in more physically demanding or dangerous jobs such as Construction and Fishing. I wonder why California and Texas have more beneficiaries. Maybe it is because of its proximity to a foreign country(Mexico). I also wonder why the age of 3 is the largest age of entry. Maybe it could be because its the age when they start going to school and parents want them to have a life full of potential. Also being ineligible might hinder one from getting a high paying, minimal physical laboring job.\n\nHeadline: Immigrants search for a better life for their young",

While children below 13 years of age lessens in DACA beneficiaries. But I wonder why, is it because of economic problems, do they feel that because they\u2019re older they don\u2019t need it? I also noticed that California has more DACA beneficiaries and that DACA eligible workers have fairly-good paying jobs with less work. While DACA ineligible workers have more hard and dangerous jobs. But, I wonder why when the, \u201c Top Occupations Among Undocumented Immigrants\u201d choices require more work ethic. The DACA eligible workers percentage lowers, while the other increases in percentage?

The bars colored yellow exhibit the largest amounts of whatever it's measuring. I wondered why only these states were included; were these states the ones who most experience immigration? I also asked why the graph went up to 15 years old, but then I figured that the age that would determine someone as a child would be 15 and under, therefore, the information from this graph wouldn't be prevalent.
