I notice that the cars that cost the most for the initial purchase price, the electric cars, cost the least per month overall, and are the best for the environment, having the least amount of carbon emissions on average at about 200 grams of carbon dioxide per mile, and the cars that cost the least for the initial price re the worst for the environment, and cost the most per month.\n2. I wonder how electric car companies are going to lower the initial cost of electric cars, so it would seem more practical for a potential car-buyer.\n3. This has an impact on the people that think that the initial purchase price for an electric car makes them less practical, and use the traditional gas-powered cars instead. Then they have to pay more per month then they could have if they had payed for the electric car instead, and it has an impact on our global climate change through increasing our total carbon emissions by buying cars that are more carbon-emissive.\n4. This graph shows that although electric cars have a higher initial purchase price, they cost less per month, and are better for the environment then any other type of gas-powered car.

These electric cars also cost less than many other cars. I also noticed that the carbon dioxide emissions of the hybrid cars can vary widely. Some of the hybrid cars produce less carbon dioxide than the other vehicles, but many of hybrid cars emit more carbon dioxide than the gas-powered cars. The gas-powered cars have the largest range in carbon dioxide emissions and average cost of maintenance. The diesel cars are very concentrated in the average cost per month and the amount of emitted carbon dioxide, both of which being very high. \n\nThese observations cause me to wonder why vehicles that are more costly and worse for the environment are used. If more average civilians can use electric cars, or gas-powered cars with lower carbon dioxide emission rates, it could help to slow climate change and save money. I also wonder how we can help implement a change to persuade people to use more cost effective cars that produce less carbon dioxide. \n\nThe impact the information in this graph has on me and my community is the amount of carbon dioxide produced by different types of cars and subsequent climate change. If more vehicles continue using fossil fuels, the effects of climate change will have a serious impact. Conversely, if more people use electric cars, it can lower carbon emissions from vehicles considerably, which would be beneficial.",

However, there are people out there that would prefer their own type of car in a style they like. for example, some guys prefer race cars or at least something fast, or for race car drivers, that's their profession.

This shows that there is an obvious visual representation showing that traditional cars are inefficient. Whilst the newer, more modern cars appear to be more efficient, on petrol, and a monetarily wiser decision. I do however, wonder wether this graph is skewed a bit, there seems to be a great variance in traditional cars, yet I wonder if a traditional car could be at both extremes at once. Although this is a general representation, I concur that this affects me, and my life in an amplitude of ways. Some ways traditional cars affect me is due to the pollution they cause, I live in a suburban city, a place where large concentrations are exposed to the general public, very bad. The graph though, represents this very clearly, doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out traditional cars are dirtier, more expensive, and inefficient.",

Smaller gas-powered cars such as the Honda Civic also have a lower average cost per month but do produce more carbon dioxide emissions than electric cars and some hybrid cars. Traditional gas-powered cars have both the greatest carbon dioxide emissions and the highest average costs per month. There is a group of diesel cars that sit rather in the middle of the graph with higher average costs per month but not the highest and high carbon dioxide emission but not the greatest.\nI wonder what a fuel cell is. I also wonder how many people drive diesel cars compared to electric cars and gas-powered cars. What factors do people consider buying their car? Do they care more about the usage of the car, whether it's eco-friendly, or the price? I wonder what aspects of electric cars are allow them to have such low average costs per month. \nThis impacts me because I drive. I drive a small old family car, which, based on this graph, most likely produces a smaller amount of carbon dioxide emissions and doesn't cost too much per month. This impacts the community because carbon dioxide emissions contribute to pollution and global warming. By driving more eco-friendly cars, we can reduce our carbon footprint; it's also cost-efficient as electric cars have lower average costs per month.\nA headline could be \"Electric Cars: The Future of Our Cars and Our Environment\".",

I also noticed the small group of diesel cars which seem to be both expensive and emit a lot of carbon dioxide. I wonder if the electric on the graph included the amount of carbon dioxide required to generate their electricity. If it does, then it seems like we have a clear winner for cost and emissions. Of course, there may variables that I haven't considered, but it does seem like the future of cars lie in electrically powered vehicles.",

The majority of these cars, however, has very similar average cost per month for maintenance and fuel. The two cars that really stand out in the graph is definitely Toyota Sequola and Lexus QX. These two cars are notable for being one of the costliest car and, at the same time, release the most amount of carbon dioxide. It seems the engine for these two cars are very strong, requiring costly equipment that would make the car fast but not environmental friendly\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nWhen will human be able to create cheap but low carbon dioxide emission cars with strong engine?\n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nThe graph shows that there are options for environmental conscious people who wants to help the earth in some way but do not break the bank for it\n\nHeadline: Environmental friendly cars but do not break the bank?",

The prices of each type of car increases dependent on the model. Diesel cars seem to be the type of cars with the highest starting point compared to others. \n\nI wonder if people take into consideration average carbon dioxide emissions per mile when buying a car. I also wonder why cars that are that expensive and emit that much carbon dioxide per mile. I also wonder what can be done to lower the amount of carbon dioxide emitted in these expensive cars.\n\nThis impacts my community because of the impact many of the cars have on the environment.

Additionally, traditional gas powered cars create the most amount of carbon emissions per mile, but can range in price from most expensive to least expensive per month. This is likely because traditional gas-powered cars are the most abundantly distributed car. Hybrid cars are an average of traditional gas-powered cars and electric cars. They emit less carbon dioxide per mile than gas-powered cars, but the emit more carbon dioxide per mile than electric cars. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nFrom what I have heard from my peers, people refrain from thinking about buying electric cars because they believe they are too expensive. If people knew about the cost efficiency of electric cars, would they be more willing to buy them? \n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nThe current climate crisis will ultimately effect almost every person in my generation. Many scientists believe that air pollution has caused an increase in cancers, cognitive decline, and depression. Carbon emissions are one of the most significant causes of this air pollution. Thus, the information in this graph should be used to motivate people to buy electric cars instead of traditional gas-powered cars. \n\nHeadline: \nAre electric cars out of your budget?

One thing that surprised me was that the Toyota Mirai although being hydrogen fuel cell, the cost per month is just as high as a Mercedes Benz s class amg, which is surprising first because it a new type of cell car and I wouldn't expect it to cost so much, and second of all because you're not hurting the environment almost at all compared to the Mercedes. The Impact I see on my community is that In the future I will hopefully have a family and I want to be able to show them how beautiful the ocean is, how beautiful nature is, and due to so many people using carbon emission cars, that future might not happen, till we act upon the cars we are still using. The first thing I noticed when just checking the scatter plot, is that the most used type of a car is gasoline and the second most used surprisingly is diesel and then comes to the electric and fuel cell cars. Something interesting I saw in the graph also was that Nissan, Toyota, and GMC are all at the top of the scatter plot because all the cars on the top are 8 cylinder cars.",

I also see how the least amount belongs to Diesel cars and fits in with the data of gas-powered cars pretty similarly in terms of location like cost, but more so emissions. This graph is average cost per month, and I\u2019m wondering when the graph started counting the average, because many months ago, traditional gas powered may have been the overwhelming option. I wonder what the gap is between more ecofriendly cats geared to consumers and race cars? It\u2019s also interesting to see how the emissions goes down the less gas-powered it is, from gas powered to hybrid to electric. Now in terms of cost per month, the range of gas-powered is way larger and the max cost is the highest. But this doesn\u2019t include the initial cost of the car, so it may be proving that electrically run vehicles are better in the long run and prevent the growth of emissions. This impacts how cars will be used in our community for sure because of the cost effectiveness impact it has, and environmentally approachable changes that can be made resulting in usage of different vehicles.

What is it? It seems to be extremely far away from everything else on the graph. If we learned more about that, perhaps we could interpret the graph better. People use cars to get around. That\u2019s a fact and that probably will not change anytime in the foreseeable future. The prevalent concern surrounds the carbon dioxide emissions. Do the concerns surrounding our climate change and carbon dioxide emissions warrant a change in the type of cars people use? As the next generation of buyers, that could be up to us.",

    "comment info": "Looking at the graph, we can see that electric cars are both the cheapest to maintain per month and also emit the least amount of carbon dioxide. The traditional gas-powered cars have the widest range of cost per month as well as carbon dioxide emissions. Something interesting is that the entire diesel car category fits within the traditional gas-powered car category. Overall, as the price of the car increases, the carbon dioxide emissions increase as well. We were wondering what the fuel cell dot was, because it does not fit into any of the categories on the scatter plot. The impact of this graph could help consumers who are looking to purchase a new car could choose a car that is most cost effective and emits less carbon dioxide. It also shows that electric cars are not only environmentally friendly, but they are also cheaper to maintain. A catchy headline for this graph could be \u201cCost of Cars and their Environmental Impact\u201d.",

    "comment info": "Based on the data presented in the graph, our group found that there are five main groups of vehicles presented, consisting of traditional gas-powered cars, diesel cars, hybrid vehicles, fuel cell, and electric cars. The dots, representing a specific car make, all have a wide range in average cost per month and CO2 emissions per mile. Furthermore, we noticed gas-powered cars have the highest emissions rate while also maintaining a high average cost. Electric cars, on the other hand, had mostly similar monthly costs as their gas-powered counterparts but had far fewer emissions per mile. Based on these observations, we wondered what if the size of a car had any correlation to CO2 emission levels as well as if the dots that are clustered together have the same manufacturer? Lastly, our group analyzed the impact that the data presented in this graph had on us and our community. In today\u2019s environment where pollution is a major topic, this graph helped reveal what cars are not only environmentally friendly, but also helped save consumer\u2019s money.

We noticed that the least efficient car in the graph was the Toyota Sequoia, whereas one of the most efficient cars was an electric Nissan Leaf. Diesel cars were found to be some of the least efficient cars and with some of the highest pricing under $55,000. We wondered how this graph could be represented differently, such as on a bar graph. We also wonder why the Honda Civic and the Toyota Sequoia are both gas fueled cars but their carbon dioxide emissions are so different. Lastly, we wonder if electric cars in the long run can be more cost effective due to the average cost per month. The climate crisis is something that is affecting our generation more than ever before and it is important to start to transfer to lifestyles that have lower impacts on the environment.

Based on the information and our brainstorming, we wondered if there is a correlation between maintenance costs per month and carbon dioxide emissions.

The Nissan Leaf and Honda Civic are cheaper, and they also use less than 400 grams of carbon dioxide emissions per mile, which is a lot less than traditional power gas in cars. We wonder if Americans will resort to electric cars someday in the future. Gas-powered cars have a negative effect on the environment, so it'd be important for people to turn to electric cars. I believe if more Americans were made aware of how much better electric cars are for the environment I think more people would invest in electric cars. This particularly impacts us and our community because we can see that even though we live in a wealthier city, not many people drive an electric car. We believe this has to do with education and beliefs. Perhaps people aren't that interested in helping the environment and would rather buy a fancy gas-powered car instead.

First, we noticed that traditional gas owned cars have the widest range in carbon dioxide emissions. At the top of this range, the Toyota Sequoia emits above 800 grams of co2 per mile. At the lower end of this range, the honda civic emits around 300 grams of co2. Second, we noticed the more carbon dioxide emitted from the vehicle, the more the average cost monthly to maintain the vehicle with the expectation being the fuel cell car. \nFinally, we noticed that electric cars have the least amount of carbon emission per mile which makes sense and then the hybrid cars are a little above the electric. I wonder why some cars are way more costly than others. I also wonder how a hybrid car could be just as spendy as a diesel car. Another thing I wonder is how a hybrid car could cost just as much as a regular gas car. This impacts us and our communities by showing us what cars pollute the most and which are the most eco friendly, such as the Toyota Sequoia which produces almost 800 grams of carbon emissions every single mile!

The Nissan Leaf and Honda Civic are both on the cheaper side, less than $350 a month, and they also use less than 400 grams of carbon dioxide emissions per mile, which is way less than traditional gas-powered cars. \n\nI wonder when/if America will eventually shift to mostly electric cars. We are starting to see the impact gas-powered cars have on the environment so I wonder if we, as a society, will notice these effects and switch over to driving mostly electric cars. \n\nThis effects my community because I live in a very densely populated state and the roads are always very busy.

I wonder if  the electric cars and hybrid/plug in vehicles will become more common and take over the markets since they are on average cheaper per month than the traditional  gas powered vehicles and are far better for the environment. When are we, as Americans, gonna choose the obvious choice in better cars, cheaper cars, and healthier cars. This impacts me and my community because as we all know, we as citizens of America and our own individual communities are trapped into paying whatever gas prices that the gas stations charge and have no control and no input about it, because if we don't pay the obnoxiously high prices for gas, then we simply won't be able to drive our cars, therefore not being able to go to our jobs or schools, not making money, and wrecking the entire community we've built for ourselves. We would not rely on gas prices, we'd pay less money on average per month, and help the environment by switching over to electric and hybrid vehicles. The graph is basically just showing the average carbon dioxide emissions per mile for each type of car versus it's average price per month. Slogan- \"the Cheaper the Hog, the less there's Smog\".",

How many per capita (divide number of vehicles by the population)?  How does this compare to the U.S. number of electric cars per capita?  What impact would this have on you, your community and your state?",

There appears to be a positive correlation between cost and carbon emissions meaning that more expensive cars tend to have higher emissions. The electric cars of course have the lowest carbon emissions while the gas-powered cars have the highest. The Nissan Leaf seems to be one of the cheapest and low-emission vehicles on the graph. The Toyota Sequoia seems to have some of the highest emissions and one of the highest costs out of the vehicles on the graph. I wonder if the vehicles on the top right of the graph are larger (SUVs, vans, etc). I also wonder what the difference between diesel and gas-powered cars is.\nMy community is heavily sprawled and there is not much public transportation, so cars are a necessity for most people. This graph would be very helpful for people in my community who are looking to buy a car that is environmentally friendly yet affordable. Unfortunately, even electric cars have carbon emissions. Hopefully in the future, cars can become a thing of the past as our society finds more environmentally friendly ways of life. Designing cities and neighborhoods which are pedestrian friendly and not as sprawled is definitely a step in the right direction.\nHeadline: Cars, Cost, and Carbon",
