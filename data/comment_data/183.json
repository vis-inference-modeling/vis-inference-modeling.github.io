It seems that the smallest percentage of people visit their parents in person (15-25%), while the largest percentage of young individuals (50-75%) reach out to their parents either daily or a few times a week. Additionally, the gender difference in communication habits, with women being 20% more likely to use text or video-chat compared to men.\nI wonder if the prevalence of text and video-chat communication among young people is due to its convenience compared to writing long texts. Furthermore, I'm curious if there's a difference in communication between the young adults who were surveyed who are closer to 18 and those closer to 34. This could potentially bring to light whether certain life stages influence the amount of communication people have with parents. This is relevant to me and my community as I am going for college next year where my main form of communication with my parents will be texting and video-chatting to stay in touch  since I won't be seeing them daily.\n\nTitle:\u201cBuzz buzz\u201d",

I notice that more young women(75%) than young men(50%) say that they reach out over text at least once a day or a few times a week. Overall in this graph across the three different categories, young women reach out to their parents more than young men.  I also noticed that the mode of communication least frequently used across the graph is in-person visits. This makes sense as respondents are between 18 and 34 and most likely do not live in close proximity to their parents and may hold very demanding jobs or may be involved in rigorous higher education programs. Online communication has also become more convenient and prominent in the 21st century. I wonder why young women reach out to their parents across all of the categories. I wonder if they have closer relationships with their parents than the young men or if they simply just feel the need to maintain more frequent communication. This relates to myself and my community as I will soon be going to college and turning 18 and I wonder where I would fall on this graph. I know I will maintain contact with my parents and I assume it will fall into a more digital category especially when I am away in college.\n\nWhy parents want daughters: they keep in touch!",

I notice that in every category of communication, women reach out to their parent(s) more than men. I wonder why this is. Is it just a matter of inherent psychological differences between men and women?  Additionally, I noticed that visiting a parent in person is the least popular method of reaching out to a parent and texting is the most popular method. I speculate that this is because of convenience. Texting is so easy and can be done in a matter of seconds while driving all the way to visit your parents could take hours depending on how far they live. I am surprised texting and calling are not more popular because they are so accessible and easy to use. I wonder how this demographic would change if they surveyed people older than 34. This relates to me because I am going to college next year and will be forced to reach out to my parents because I will no longer be living with them. I will try to contact them at least a few times per week most frequently using text and calls rather than visits. \n\"Message Mothers More!\"",

Also, out of the forms of communication, most young people contact their parents through sending text messages at 50% for young men and 75% for young women. This is interesting because text messages could be considered a faster form of communication than phone/video-chat and visits in person. I wonder if more young people prefer sending text messages to their parents because it is fast and convenient. Why do the amount of young people that contact their parents often vary between men and women? I wonder if young adults closer to the age of 18 that were surveyed reached out to their parents more or less than young adults closer to the age of 34. How many young adults stated that they do not contact their parents and were screened out of the survey?

How will my age impact how frequently and what source I contact my parents? This also relates to my community as it can demonstrate the closeness of parent\u2013child relationships and young adult\u2019s dependence on their parents in adulthood. \n\n\u201cThe Importance of Text Messages\u2013In Young Adults\u2019 Contact With Their Parents\u201d",

Womenare more likely than men to reach out to their parents at least once a day. However, it is mainly digital with just under 75% responding that they text and over 50% saying that they call their parents. Only about 25% of young women responded that they visit their parents on a daily or weekly basis. On the other hand, young men are far less likely to have active communication with their parents. About 50% text, between 25%-50% call, and less than 25% see their parents frequently. I wonder why the percentage of seeing parents regularly is so low. I understand that this poll was asked by 18-34-year-olds who live with either one or no parents, but I feel like this statistic is so low. I wonder how these statistics have changed over time. With the new age of social media and technology, has there been a significant increase in young people who can communicate with their parents daily? This relates to my community because as a teenager, communication is key with my parents and most of my friend's parents. If we do not answer them right away or frequently check in, parents nowadays are prone or getting anxious and hysterical. I wonder in the upcoming generation if these numbers will spike because of the constant communication needed between child and parent. \n\n\u201cCall Your Mom!

Whether its sending texts, phone or video-chat, or a visit in person, women always tend to do so more then men and some by a large margin. What I wonder is if the percentages have increased or decreased over time by both men and women of how often they reach out to their parents.  Also if visiting in person decreased when more kids started getting phones. What's going on in this graph is it is trying to show the different ways young people will reach out to their parents, characterizing it by gender, and showing the percentage difference between men and women and how men truly do not seem to reach out as much as women. This relates to my community because I have siblings and I think my sister, who is out of the house, and I reach out more then my brother does.

Could it be because women are more family-oriented? Visiting in person is rated the lowest way to communicate or reach out to parents.

I additionally noticed that the majority of young adults contact their parents virtually, either through texting or calling, with a minority of young adults visiting in person, likely due to long distances between them and their parents. I find it interesting that while women and men are almost just as likely to visit in person, there is a much larger gap between women who virtually keep in touch with their parents and men that do. I wonder what factors contribute to this large difference. I am curious to know what this graph would look like if they provided different, more specific age groups within the young adult category.

I noticed in this graph the significantly more amount of women who sent texts, called, or visited in person. I also noticed that the most popular form of communication among both genders is texting. I wonder how far these people live from their parents, especially since the percentage of going home and visiting is so low. This relates to me and my community because my brother and his wife live in South Carolina, and my sister lives in Rhode Island,  while the rest of my family lives in New Jersey.

The graph tells viewers in what way and what percentage of people reach out to their parents at least once a day. Interestingly, this graph shows that young women are more likely to reach out to their parents overall. I wonder if this is because women are more family-oriented or thoughtful. I think it is interesting that the least popular mode of contact between parents and their children is in-person visits. I wonder if this is because a lot of these children live far from their families, maybe in college, or maybe they have just moved away. I also wonder what the specific age group that participated in this survey is, and if there was a major difference in responses between the ages (ex. an 18-year-old vs a 24-year-old). I would title this graph \"Parents and Children: How Connected Are They Really?\"",

I noticed that, in general, young women had a higher percentage of reaching out to parents than young men did. I also noticed that, for both women and men, the most popular means of communication was by sending texts and the least popular means of communication was visiting in person. I wonder if this is because sending texts requires much less time and effort compared to visiting in person so it is easier for young adults to quickly send a text amidst their busy daily schedules. I also noticed that there was the lowest difference in percentage between men and women for visiting in person and wonder why this is the case compared to the disparity between genders being relatively higher for phone/video-chat and sending texts. This relates to my community because I know some people in college who don\u2019t live with their parents right now and it is often difficult for them to find time to contact their families but try to text or call them as much as they can.

It displays the percentage of young people that reach out to a parent at least once a day or a few times per week, whether over text, the phone, or in-person visits. The graph shows that women tend to reach out to their parents more often than men among all of the communication methods. I also noticed that both men and women are less likely to visit in-person, as opposed to communicating over technology. I think it would be interesting to see a secondary graph that displays the average distance between where those polled live versus where their parents live. If many individuals that were polled live far from their parents, this would be one explanation for why less people visit their parents in person.

Young people most likely tend to reach out to a parent by sending texts, while they are least likely to visit in person. There are also noticeable gaps between the percentages of women and men. While for sending text only under 50% of young men reach out, just under 75% of young women send text. There is also a noticeable gap for phone or video-chat as only around ~30% of men reach out while over a little 50% of women do in contrast. Visiting in person had the least difference around 5% with percentages of 25 and under.\n\n2) Why are young women more likely than men? How would these people describe their relationships with their parents? \n\n3) As the family is a big part of many people's lives while we all may not be able to see all parts of family in person,  there are alternatives to reach out as we live in a modern digital world.

The statistics for all three categories for women combine to over 100%, suggesting that many young women not only frequently communicate with, but utilize several different methods, to talk to their parents. This is much higher compared to men, where the sum of all 3 categories barely reaches 100%, meaning that young men do not as regularly communicate with their parents. This may be because, according to societal standards, women are raised to be more mindful of their family and are meant to be more sensitive to the physical and emotional needs of those around them. Men, on the other hand, are raised according to the social conception of masculinity to become independent and less openly emotional or communicative in their relationships, meaning that young adult men will be less likely to maintain a close relationship with their parents.",

Across visits, texts, and calls/video chats, young women consistently reach out more frequently, with digital communication showing the largest gender gap, nearly 25% higher for women. This prompts questions about societal expectations and cultural influences shaping these patterns. Furthermore, the data suggests that in-person visits, while still less frequent overall, show a more modest discrepancy between genders. This raises questions about the significance placed on face-to-face interaction versus digital communication in parent-child relationships. Why do these gender differences manifest more prominently in virtual interactions? Reflecting on my own experience and community, I see the representation of young women, like myself, maintaining regular contact with parents, primarily through digital means due to distance. This underscores the importance of nurturing relationships beyond physical proximity, while also highlighting the need to address gender-based communication barriers within our community.

I wonder why the difference between men and women seem about the same for texts and video-chats but the difference is not very wide for visits in person. \nThis is related to me because I fit the age demographic and don't live with my parents; since I'm a college student the people around me also fit these categories.\nTitle: \"How often do Young Adults Contact their Parents?\"",

This is likely due to a variety of factors one of which I believe is that parents are more protective over their daughters compared to their sons. I would assume a good amount of these responses are from young adults whose parents require them to call or text at least once a week. There are a lot of things I wonder about the graph, one of them being if there is a difference between the teens and the people in their thirties. The survey targeted people from the ages 18-34, which in my opinion is a pretty large gap. I would be interested in learning how getting older affects how often you reach out to your parents.  There are many ways to categorize this data, in college or not in college, taken or single, and living in a different time zone or the same time zore are just some of the many ways that this data could be explored. I would also wonder if the survey counted reaching out if the young adult was just responding to a previous text from a parent. Reaching out, especially for texting, is a little ambiguous. Personally, I call parents at least once a week and text them very often throughout the week. I don't visit them due to the distance thought. This all lines up very well with the data. A title could be \"C'mon, they deserve a call\"",

I imagine that this is still a bit less than many people would hope. Another thing I notice is how the smallest gap appears with visiting in person. I suppose that visiting in person has less to do with gender and more to do with location. I wonder how they find the time to visit in person at least a few times a week, since even if you live relatively close, it can be hard to find the time to do so. And if someone did live that close, I wonder why they wouldn't just live with their parents to begin with. \nThis relates to me and my community as I'm a young college student living a few hours drive away from home. I'm more likely to text than to call, but I still often times call about once a week. \nI would name this graph \"Young Women More Likely to Call Mom than Men\", or \"Most Kids Prefer Texting their Parents, Not Calling\".",

    "comment info": "From the graph, I noticed that the graph compares the frequency of communication between young men and young women with their parents. It looks at three modes of communication: sending texts, phone or video-chat, and visiting in person. Particularly, young women consistently communicate more frequently with their parents across all methods compared to young men. Texting is the most common method for both genders, with the largest gap in communication frequency observed here. The difference in frequency of in-person visits is the smallest, though it still shows that young women visit their parents more often than young men. I wonder why there is a noticeable difference in communication frequencies between genders. Are gender norms or upbringings influencing these patterns? Also, how might these patterns shift as people age beyond their 30s? What would the data look like if only considering those in their early twenties or college students? As a college student, my community is filled with mainly busy individuals and for many young adults, moving out from their parents' home marks a transition to more independence. However, the frequency of contact with parents can vary widely depending on individual circumstances like proximity, work schedules, and the nature of the parent-child relationship.

I also noticed that for both genders, texting is the common form of communication with their parents. I think this must have to do with the convenience and mobility of texting, rather than sitting on a phone call or traveling home to see their parents. I notice that visiting their parents in person is the least common way of reaching out to a parent. I think this is because most people 18-22 are away from home at college making it not possible to visit home. And people 22-34 are typically working wherever they can find a job and often that is not in their hometown. \n\nI wonder why women have a higher overall percentage of reaching out than men. I also wonder if the proximity of your college to your hometown plays a role in communication. For example if someone visits their parents a few times a week, they may be less inclined to text or call their parents often. I would also be intrigued to know whether the kids in college in this study communicate more than the people working.\n\nThis relates to me because I am a male in college and I do call with my parents everyday so it is very interesting to see that I am in the minority of all males in the age bracket. I think keeping in touch with your parents is the best way to keep a strong relationship with them as being in college is different from our early lives where we saw them everyday.\n\nKeeping in Touch, Who Does It Best?",

The data highlights notable differences between genders in their preferred methods of maintaining regular contact.\nAmong young women, texting emerges as the dominant mode of communication, with 100% reaching out to a parent via text at least once a day or a few times per week. In comparison, only around 75% of young men exhibit the same texting frequency. Young men show a higher inclination towards phone or video chats, with approximately 75% using these methods regularly, as opposed to only about 50% of young women.\nInterestingly, despite the prevalence of digital communication, a significant proportion of both genders, roughly 25%, still prioritize in-person visits with parents at least once a day or a few times weekly. This underscores the persistent value placed on face-to-face interaction in fostering close family ties. \nThe data presents a nuanced picture of a generation navigating independence while striving to maintain strong parental connections. \n\nAn interesting title may be: The Talk: Do Young Men or Women Talk More with Their Parents",

For instance, young women seem to send texts or talk on the phone with their parents 25% more frequently than young men. It appears that young women and young men are most similar in how often they visit their parents in person, with only about a 5% difference in frequency. Also, texting seems to be the most frequent form of communication for both young women and men. \nSomething I wonder about this graphic is why women tend to reach out more to their parents.  On top of that, I also wonder which parent they tend to reach out to more overall. For instance, I call my mom practically every day to keep her updated on my college life and then she'll just fill in my dad. However, this probably varies from person to person, and it would be interesting to see.\nThis relates to me as a person because out of my brother and I, I tend to reach out more to my parents. This could be because I'm the second child and therefore rely on my parents more for some things, but I also believe it does have something to do with me being a young woman versus my brother being a young man.

Both genders are more likely to communicate via text compared to any other method.\nI wonder why more women as opposed to men are willing to reach out to their parents. Is it because girls tend to form stronger bonds with their parents? Personally, I text or call my parents close to every day just to briefly check in with them, so this is the case for me. Other college students who also no longer see their parents daily, might not communicate as frequently because they are busy with their classes or work. Furthermore, everyone has a different relationship with their parents, so constant communication might be a low priority for some.

It would also be interesting to see how often mothers and fathers initiate contact with their children and whether similar patterns exist.\n\nAs a college student, I find it hard to keep in regular contact with my parents, but try to do so once every month.\n\nA potential catchy headline could be : \"Staying in Touch\"",

    "comment info": "The graph shows that a higher percent of young women contact their parents at least once a week than young men do. Higher percentages of both genders seem to use text messaging the most and in-person visits the least. It surprised me that less than 50% of young men reach out to a parent at least once a week via text, call, or in person. The question under the title of the graph is \"How involved are parents in their children's lives?\". I wonder if higher percentages of women contact their parents more because parents are more involved in their female children's lives, if young women have stronger relationships with their parents than their male counterparts, or if women are simply better at communicating and staying in touch. This relates to our community because for most college students we are no longer living with our parents and seeing them everyday. Everyone has different family dynamics that affect how often they contact their parents, but maybe gender is a part of this too. What makes this  a good graph to it putting the y-axis label horizontally which makes the graph easier to read. Another aspect of the graph I like is how they used percentages to compare the data. Had the authors used counts or means or ratios, the viewer would have had to more interpretations of their own to figure out the story the graph is telling us.

In terms of how they reach out, young women send texts to a parent almost 25% more than young men who send texts. However, when it comes to visiting a parent in person, the gap between men and women is a lot smaller. According to the visual, young women are more likely to reach out to a parent, no matter how they do so, compared to young men.\n\nI wonder how this visual would change depending the country in which the people were surveyed. In some countries, it is more common to stay closely connected with family and would be interesting to see how this differs around the world. I also wonder what this graphic would look for an older age group such as 35-40. I think it would also be interesting to see how frequently mothers and fathers reach out to their kids and wonder if some of the gaps that we see in this visual would be the same.\n\nThis relates to me because, as a college student, I do find it really important to reach out to my parents frequently.

It breaks down the communication methods into sending texts, phone or video-chat, and visiting in person. I noticed that while young women appear to reach out to their families at a higher rate than young men do, regardless of modality, that texting is the most common/ popular means of keeping in touch, as it has the highest percentages in either gender. \nVisiting in person shows the lowest gap between genders,  but is still less popular than other modalities.\nI wonder how the way that female and male children are socialized impacts the way and the frequency with which they stay in parents-- are girls more prone to keeping in touch because they spent more time with parents, or because they feel it is expected? Of the participants that has high rates of contact, how many of them were eldest or only children? \nThis resonates with me as my mom and I text nearly every day. Video and phone calls are harder to line up with different schedules, and in-person visits are the hardest-- we see each other a handful of times each year. Based on this, I'm inclined to think that schedule/ convenience has a decent weight behind the rates observed in this graph.\nI think a good headline could be, \"Texts and Calls: The New Bridge Between Today's Young Adults and Their Parents\"",

Based on these observations, I wonder if there is a scientific reason or generational influence behind why less young men contact a parent compared to young women when they live away from their parent(s). The results portrayed in the graph relate to many of my family, friends, and I who are either close to or currently entering college and adulthood which likely involves moving away from our parents and childhood homes. When we reach this stage in our lives, this graph can help predict how often we will connect with our parents through texting, calling, or visiting in person because the samples of people used in the graph are not too distant from our ages, and the experiment is recent.",

On average, young women maintain more consistent communication with their parents compared to young men, with a significant gap observed in electronic forms of communication such as texts or calls. The discrepancy remains even when considering in-person visits, albeit to a lesser extent. This disparity could be particularly noteworthy during the college years, a period which is known for creating a newfound independence for many. This makes me wonder how different these statistics would be different if the age range was narrower. It seems fair that young adults, especially those in college, would reach out less to their parents as they feel  more independent, but is this trend truly as evident past college years? This analysis is significant for me and my community as it highlights the importance of regular communication with parents, especially by a young male adult within this age range. It makes me want to reach even more as a college student myself and truly keep my parents involved with my life away from \"home\".\n\nHeadline: \"Is Parental Communication a Common Priority?\"",

First,  I would be interested in seeing just college age (around 18-24) because this is their first experience living away from home, while a 34 year old has been away from their parents for possibly 16 years. Also, college students technically still live at home and are usually dependent on their parents in some way, as opposed to 34 year olds who likely live on their own and are fully independent from their parents. \n\nThis relates to me and my community because I am currently  a male in this age range (and will be for many more years), so the disparity is concerning. It makes me more conscious of how often I am communicating with my parents and something I should consider more in the future. \n\nHeadline: \"How Often Do You Check on Your Parents?\"",

The difference between men and women visiting their parents in person is fairly similar, with women only visiting their parents in person about 5% more than men. The difference between men and women reaching out to parents via text, phone, or video chat is much more significant. It seems to be about a 40% difference, with women having the higher percentage. I wonder why exactly it is so common for women to reach out to their parents more often than men. There seems to be some sort of association between gender and parent relationship fostering, but the graph makes me wonder what exactly is causing this significant difference. I also wonder why there is such a drastic difference in face-to-face visits versus texts or calls. For a relationship as important as one with a parent, I would normally assume that people would place more emphasis on in person visits, but this graph is causing me to think otherwise. This graph relates to me and my community because I identify as part of the group of young women who does not live with my parents. As a result, I have to make an effort to foster the relationship I have with my parents, updating my life through calling and texting.

We observe that there are preferred methods from which both men and women use to reach out. Then there is also variation across gender shown in the graphs. We can see that young women are more likely than young men as a whole to reach out to their parents even across all three methods. However, the strength of this increase is very similar for sending texts and phone or video-chat but not as much as for visiting in person. I wonder why it is that men are less likely to reach out to their parents since it's observed for all three methods.  About 2 in 4 young men who took this online survey who are aged 18 to 34 reach out to their parents at least once a day or a few times a week while about 3 in 4 women do this. Further indicating that the parents of women tend to be more involved in their lives as a result of women reaching out more. This relates to men and my community since I fall into this demographic of young men who don't reach out to my parents very often. This relates to the male community as a whole since it could correlate with the silent epidemic surrounding men as they are more afraid to reach out. Preferring to keep to themselves.

How does their relationship with their parents affect their response?\nThis relates to me and my community because everyone is constantly growing up and has some kind of parental figure, and is developing into their own person and this can change the ways you interact with each other and your parents.\n\"Contacting the Other- Communicating With Your Parent\"",

        "comment info": "@Karlee Nicholson I agree with your statement about texting. I wonder if it's because it may be the easiest and less complicated way to get in contact with someone if it's long distance. Also, to one of your questions, I think that maybe texting would be ideal for children and parents if they had a more distant and less close of a relationship to each other because they don't have to see each other face to face.",

    "comment info": "The graph shows how likely young adults either female or male interact with their parents each time a week. It says that they either text, call, or actually talk to their parent in person. The graph shows that they are most likely to send a text to their parents with it being roughly 50% males will text their parents while 75% females will text their parents. The least likely to be done is actually visiting the parent in person with only 26% females and roughly 18%. There is definitely a difference here with males always being in the lower margin and females being in the larger margin. This most likely has to do with the gender differences between males and females.",

If men don't contact their parents then they will be more worried.",

There's a notable decline in the percentage of adults who report getting less than 7 hours of sleep per night during the same period. I wonder what factors contributed to this increase in the percentage of adults getting enough sleep? This relates to my community because improved sleep habits among adults can have positive implications for overall health, productivity, and well-being. It might indicate a growing emphasis on self-care and wellness. \n\nCatchy headline:\n\"Sleep Revolution: More Americans Than Ever Finally Getting Enough Zzzs!\"",

I wonder why this is, is it because of the use of phones or of social in anxieity. This effects my community because when i am downtown or anywhere i never see kids my age or if i do they are on their phones we need yo put our phones down and go outside.",
