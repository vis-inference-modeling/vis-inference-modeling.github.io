The graph allows people to consider their own water consumption habits and the broader implications for their communities. It highlights the interconnectedness of water usage across sectors and the potential ramifications of continued high consumption, especially in the context of climate change and population growth. \"Thirsty River: Livestock and Crops Guzzle 80% of Colorado River's Vital Waters \u2013 Urgent Calls for Sustainable Solutions to Avert Crisis!\" is a catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea.",

A solid majority of it goes into the process of raising livestock, and another smaller, yet still substantial, slice goes into other forms of agriculture. Very little of the water goes directly towards humans.\nI wonder why anyone hasn't made a way to reduce the amount of water that livestock takes up. It's very plain to see that animals require a lot of money to be raised into a viable resource. They need water for the animals to drink and to use for raising their feed. \nThis is important to me, as a decline in the Colorado River means a lack of water that fuels many people's livelihoods, as well as the market. This could result in many people having to move and and ending up losing jobs.

This graph illustrates what percentage of the total 1.9 trillion gallons of water being used is allotted to which industries. The Colorado River is a huge source of water for people, crops, animals, and power for the entire Western portion of America. In recent years, the rivers' flow has decreased. As seen in this graph, the river's water is used for varying reasons that support life. It is relied upon by millions of people to sustain their food, power, clothes, drinking water, and more. Interestingly, most of the water ends up being used by livestock, an interesting fact I thought was unexpected. I think the most important part of this graph is how it outlines that this river is vitally important to countless aspects of life. If problems persist and this river is no longer available for use, it could be detrimental to life in the West. I think this graph could be called \"Say Thank You to The Colorado River.\"",

It shows that 56% goes to livestock, 24% goes to other crops (cotton, wheat, corn, grain, barley, etc.), and 21%  goes to everything else (residential, commercial industrial, and thermoelectric power).  The Colorado River is shrinking rapidly. If it dries out, it would cause a catastrophe in the West. By analyzing this graph, we can see how to reduce our use of the water from the Colorado River.  The caption says that the Colorado River provides water for over 40 million people. I wonder in which category this statistic is factored into the graph. I assume that this would be included in either commercial or residential use. These two categories take up a tiny percentage of the Colorado River water each year. While we can attempt to reduce our daily intake of water, the larger consumers of water must be addressed first. Reducing our water use on animals and plants will make a bigger difference. I notice that over half of the water is devoted to livestock. We need to find ways to make this water use more sustainable. We could install more desalinization plants in the US to try and compensate for the lack of fresh water we have left. This could help reduce the use of water for livestock and crops as they could live off of desalinated freshwater.

Considering this, it makes sense that the Colorado River basin is a crucial source for the agriculture and community around it in addition to the farmland in states around it due to the fact that it fuels numerous amounts of necessities. However, drought, increased population, and climate change are negatively affecting this source of fuel by dropping the river's flow by one-third. This makes me wonder what will happen to the variety of necessities it supports and what will these negative effects impact the future of communities around it. I also wonder why the consumption of the water from the Colorado River basin is deeply abundant. While the Colorado River basin doesn't affect my community, it assuredly affects the communities around it since it is such a big fuel source and due to the decreasing river flow it negatively affects these communities.

There are 3 categories of what uses all of the water: Livestock, Other Crops, and Everything else. I notice that on the graph in the dark blue thick strip, Livestock is 56% and uses 1.064 billion gallons of water, making it the largest user/consumer of water compared to the other 2 groups shown. I also notice how in total the Other Crops is 24% and uses 448 billion gallons of water but inside out of the wheat, corn grain, barley, and other crops, cotton has the highest consumption percentage at 11%. This shows how the production of cotton requires a large amount of water. I wonder why the last category Everything else surprised me because the residential use consumption percentage was only 12% and I would expect it to be higher. I would expect it to be higher because many residential homes use a lot of water on a daily basis when using a shower, running water, or a well filtration system, etc. This relates to me and my community because I am a resident of a home and I take hot showers and I have a well system which is where my family gets its filtered water from, which I drink from every single day. This also brought to my attention the amount of water that I may use on a daily basis which makes me more aware to use less to lower my parents water bill and to save more water. \nHeadline:  Water Under the Bridge by Adele",

The Colorado River, containing 1.9 trillion gallons of water, is an imperative source to fuel everyday life for millions of people. Of the annual consummtion average, 56% (1,064 bil gal) is consumed by livestock, 24% (448 bil gal) is consumed by a multitude of crops, and 21%(387 bil gal) is consumed by electricity, industrial, or residential use. In recent years, the river has dropped to one-third of its normal size. This has been linkedmto population growth and climate change. I wonder which more of an impact. Climate change is rapid and has affected ecosystems all around the world. I wonder if overconsumption linked to increasing population has hurt the Colorado River more than climate change. If the river\u2019s flow rate proceeds to drop,will it remain a sustainable source? If not, I wonder how it will affect the surrounding communities. If it is to affect industrial companies, this could impact the American economy as a whole. In my own community, my county has two sustainable sources of water from rivers. However, we have experienced the wettest year to date but the driest October in over 100 years. This has made it difficult for farmers, who occupy most of the land, to maintain strong crops.

I notice that the livestock has the greatest amount of consumption out of the three categories with it being 56% of the total amount consumed. I also noticed that cotton has the greatest consumption percentage compared to the other crops and think this is because producing cotton requires a very large amount of water compared to grain and other crops. I was surprised that only 12% of consumption was due to residential use and think that maybe this is because the Colorado River basin might not be zoned to many residential areas or it might be difficult to filter the water for drinking or other residential uses. I also wonder why the livestock consumption percentage is so high and think a possible reason could be that if there is a large amount of livestock near the Colorado River, that water is very accessible and useful for livestock drinking water and also crop irrigation. This relates to my community because even though I don\u2019t live near the Colorado River, it is important to try to limit my daily water consumption as much as possible to help with problems like these.

This is relevant to both my\u00a0community and me because, if the Colorado River's water level steadily declines, it will eventually dry up entirely, this then will require\u00a0businesses and farms to switch to other rivers.

Of the 1.9 trillion gallons of water consumed within the Colorado River within a year, livestock consumes 1,064 billion gallons which is about 56% of the water supply per year.\n\nI wonder what type of livestock is being grown near the Colorado River. Different types of livestock require different quantities of water, so maybe the large amounts of water being consumed by livestock is because the livestock in the area simply requires more water than regular livestock. Also the quantity of livestock can be another factor because an abundant amount of livestock can and will use up a lot of water supply.\n\nThis relates to my community because to regulate water consumption we must understand what things in the environment use up the most water compared to others.

This would also be applicable to the crops since there must be a balance. However, the category of issue seems to be livestock since it makes up more than half of this graph.\n To me, there is a lot of waste that is produced in America in terms of food which only begs the question of whether or not it's actually worth investing so much water in the livestock industry when not all of it is being consumed. Without any types of reforms, I fear for what could become of our society if the Colorado River runs dry. Millions of people and animals would need water, leading them to consume from another water source with a population that already relies on it, would this cause another recession in water supply?\nThis is relatable because, I live in one of the most highly populated areas of America. To me, if this occurred in the West where it is less populated, what is to stop that from happening to us? In New Jersey, water is usually taken from neighboring states in order to provide for us which is astounding since we have one water source providing many states.

I think this is very surprising, and also concerning, seeing that there are people and crops who also need the water.\n\n2. I wonder how livestock production could better manage their water consumption in order to preserve the river's resources. The amount of water that they consume each year is staggering, and I feel that with better management they could leave more water for others.\n\n3. This strongly relates to our community, because living in Colorado there are many debates on who gets the water from the Colorado River, and seeing this graph I can see why. There are lots of arguements about which states need to use water from the Colorado River, and how much. California wants to use the water from the river, but because of the shortages they are only able to use a little bit, causing them to have to cut back on water usage. However, is this really necessary when the main user of the water is livestock? Can we manage our resources better to prevent this so that everyone can have water?\n\n4.

Everything else like residents, commercial industrial, and thermoelectric power is only using 21%.  The residents have a total of 12% of the actual water (158.25 billion gallons). \n\nSo What?\nBecause of the shrinking river, this means all the proportions are becoming less and smaller but still staying the same. An incoming problem could be the rise in the Colorado population in the past ten years might affect the water proportions with more demand for water to residents. Another problem could be the high amounts of salt inside the soil not letting the water to the crops. This will require more percentage toward crops to increase. A great solution to this is to let other parts of the country create cotton opening up 12% of the river water to other causes.\n\nTitle \"Decreasing Colorado River\"",
