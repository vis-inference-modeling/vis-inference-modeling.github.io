In fact, I often watch YouTube for too many hours on weekends. In addition, leaders of various countries have concerns about negative influences SNS can have on teens. So, some of them have started to limit its use by teens in their countries. \n2. I wonder why teens depend on SNS. I often use SNS in my free time, but I haven\u2019t clearly understood what makes SNS so attractive yet. Also, I wonder why the rate of Facebook is lowest of all. \n3. If SNS becomes widespread in my community, it will be hard for teens to focus on studying and club activities. Plus, wrong information spreads throughout my community rapidly. Then, teens will accept it without doubting if it\u2019s right and get in trouble on the internet. \n4. Reconsider Your Interactions with SNS!",

However, there are also risks associated with life online, such as cyberbullying, privacy concerns, negative impact on mental health, addiction, exposure to online predators, and the distortion of reality through idealized portrayals.

YouTube and TikTok have higher percentages of teens using them almost constantly or several times a day compared to Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook. I wonder if these patterns represent a shift in social media trends among teens over time. Are there specific reasons behind the decline in Facebook usage and the rise of platforms like TikTok? How does the time spent on these social media platforms impact teens' offline activities, such as face-to-face interactions, academic performance, or mental well-being? Understanding these usage patterns can help educators, parents, and community leaders be more aware of where teens are spending their time online. This awareness is crucial for providing relevant guidance and support. It highlights the importance of promoting digital literacy and online safety within the community. As teens are highly engaged with various platforms, ensuring they are well-informed about responsible online behavior becomes essential.\nIt's crucial to be present on platforms that teens frequent the most.

The opposite here is TikTok and Snapchat which generally have much shorter content and yet both are close to YouTube in terms of constant use. This suggests to me that there may be a crossover between the two groups who use all three platforms for the same shorter content, while YouTube has a broader appeal that TikTok does not.\n\nI wonder how this could be further broken down by age groups, as I'd put good money on the few Facebook users being much older than the average TikTok or even Instagram user. I'd also want to know the reason why each person or demographic prefers their platform, as speculation can only get you so far.\n\nIn terms of myself and my community/family I can say I notice a difference in the type of content me and family consume on a daily basis.

I am wondering how old the people were that were tested because if it was mostly 13-year-olds or 19-year-olds, there would be different results with each.\u00a0 I am also wondering what would happen if they added other programs like Spotify and Netflix, like we were talking about in class, since I know a lot of teenagers use those programs, even more as they are in their later teens. I am also wondering what this does for teens' mental health since it isn't just this time they are on screens because they use it for school work as well.\u00a0\n\n3. This affects my community because my neighbors are just starting to get into their teenage years and they are already clinging to their electronics. I do know that our generation is highly on the internet, but this idea of our generation, including me, are online most of the day, it makes you wonder what technology is going to replace for us in the future.\u00a0\n\n4.

I guess it\u2019s not surprising that Youtube is number one, especially with the addition of Youtube shorts recently. To be honest, I think Youtube might start going downhill if it doesn\u2019t get more original content soon. It feels like the most popular videos right now are all just the same gaming videos. All the good content moved to Youtube shorts, but now Youtube shorts are just a bunch of children trying to get big with trends. Overall, using Youtube just makes me feel either bored, down, or even mad. The algorithm will just constantly give you one type of video because you watched one video from that category slightly longer than usual. I wish I could just find a good Youtube documentary that\u2019s 40 or 50 minutes long and just watch it. But that type of video just isn\u2019t being made anymore.",

I wonder what necessarily separates Facebook from the rest of the social media apps and why it is the most disliked amongst the rest of the apps presented, is it simply because it's the oldest app there and people get bored of something once it becomes such a common aspect in their daily life? This relates to me and my community because lots of kids my age is addicted to their phones, so much so that our school has started to ban phone usage wherever and whenever they can, though it's hard to enforce this rule when people are constantly glued to their phones.

TikTok was launched in 2018, and known for shorter content. \nWhat do I wonder?\nI noticed that the survey was taken in April and May of  2024, and I wonder how numbers have changed since the pandemic, and how the rest of the world uses each platform. I also wonder how answers may have been biased, because this was a self-conducted survey.\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nI\u2019ve noticed that TikTok, Youtube and other forms of social media have gained popularity in recent years. More conversations are centered around content from TikTok, Snapchat, and other social media that I don\u2019t fully understand. Furthermore, news is able to spread even quicker than before, and I\u2019ve noticed a shift in social culture.\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph? Create a headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea.\nThis graph is displaying the distribution of generalized amounts of time teenagers spend on social media.

Ninety-five percent of teens use YouTube, whereas only 33% of teens use Facebook. \n\nI wonder what features of the more popular platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Snapchat appeal to teens when compared to the less popular platform, Facebook. Does the content of these popular platforms appeal to a younger audience? Do the popular platforms target teen audiences and does Facebook target older audiences? I additionally wonder what percentage of teens use no social media at all.\n\nTeen social media use has likely seen an increase in our community. The use of social media has significant implications for the way teens in our community communicate and the mental health of local teens.

I was also surprised that only 5% of teens don\u2019t use YouTube. \n\n\n2. What do you wonder?\nI'm curious if YouTube will still have such an influence on teens in the future now that TikTok is becoming one of the most popular social media apps. YouTube has been around for a while and is used for people to post videos that everyone worldwide can see. TikTok has developed the same concept of people being able to post videos even up to ten minutes long for the audience on TikTok to see. The difference between the two is that you don\u2019t have to interact while watching YouTube, but with TikTok, you do. I wonder how this will affect how popular the two apps become. \n\n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nSocial media has such a big impact on the community as a whole. Social media is how kids, teens, and adults find out information, support causes, stay connected with friends and family, and share their lives. Social media has many good values if you know how to use it, but if you don\u2019t, it could be detrimental to your view of yourself and social media. \n\n\n4. What\u2019s going on in this graph?

I wonder if the reason that YouTube is so popular in the survey is because it is kind of an outlier among the 5 platforms. \n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nThe impact this has on me and my community is that my current community is the demographic of teenagers that have been surveyed. Social media has taken over the teenage community. Based on the information given in this graph, my generation uses and/or loves using YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram. There is that outlier of people liking Facebook as well. The information shows that my generation is somewhat addicted to social media. With over 50% of people having used Snapchat and Instagram, they are subject to possible hate if they post pictures about themselves on the platform. YouTube is quite safe for teenagers unless they come under fire through the comments or videos. TikTok is the same way as YouTube, where it might not truly affect teenagers based on how much influence a teen tries to have on the platform.  \n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?

Furthermore, more of the sample uses SnapChat at least once a day than those that use Instagram each day. Overall, comparison between apps is important to understand them.\nI wonder the amount of time each day that the average user spends on each app. That would provide insight into which of these apps see the most use.

I also am interested in how social media has impacted teens' attention spans because many teens reach shorter attention spans from constant scrolling but they are also able to spend hours on the same social media platform. I would also wonder how other age groups would respond to this survey. Would they have similar results favoring social media made when they were in their youth or would they have a preference for the social media popular with teens?\nThis graph relates to me because it shows social media trends for other teenagers. This also relates to my community by providing data for marketing.

The majority of teens either use a social media platform multiple times a day or do not have it at all with only a small percent of teens constantly using any social media platform. This aligns with what I see in my life because almost no one uses Facebook. People do tend to associate Facebook with the middle to older aged people and not younger generations who more frequently use Snapchat or Tiktok.

This includes Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat for which the usage per day is very similar. I also notice that Facebook is rarely used for teens between the ages of 13-17 year olds. Finally, even though it is similar to the rest, YouTube surpasses every social media app with the most usage.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nOne question I wonder is why YouTube is so high. Could it be related to the use of the app as an educational tool? Could it be for different purposes than the following social media apps? Why is there a relation between TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram but not YouTube? The final question I have is where these statistics are coming from. For example, people seem to use Snapchat more than the graph demonstrates.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis impacts the community in a very negative way.  Phones have been a very unhealthy problem throughout the years. I could also see the certain apps people use to the damage made to the user. I also believe this can negatively affect the student's ability to learn. Finally, the content they receive can hurt these students.\n\n \u201cSocial Media\u201d- \u201cThe Damaging Consequences\u201d",

On Facebook or Instagram, you can comment on photos, directly message people, make group chats or even actual groups for certain interests, and more.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\n\nThis relates to me and my community because my community is made up of many teenagers going to school, whether middle school or high school. It is also made up of parents and grandparents who worry about their children and grandchildren. Teens aren\u2019t nearly as interested in socialization as in years before, which can cause a great decline in mental health and support systems.

This shows me that in our modern day, YouTube has become the most popular social media platform for teens, while Facebook has fallen to the bottom, often known for being used mostly by adults. \n\n2. From looking at this graphical display, I am left wondering how each of the social media platforms impacts the other's teen usage time. For example, there may have been a post on Instagram from a celebrity that drew teen user time that would have instead gone to other platforms that day. Have these social media platforms ever used each other to build on their teen usage time, in the form of collaborative events or advertising?\n\n3. Teen social media usage time has a significant impact on my community. Across America, we have seen a decrease in teen mental health and a rise in teen's social ability. Many of my peers (including myself) struggle to focus during class or stay on topic when a teacher is giving a lesson.

For example, YouTube has long been a major platform in the online entertainment space. Their algorithm has had years to develop and their development team is massive. TikTok is known for its algorithm bringing unique feeds to every person who uses it.

Youtube has the highest percentage of teens who use it significantly, the highest percentage of teens who use it several times a day, and has the fewest percentage of teens who don\u2019t use the platform. Another idea that I would also point out is that Snapchat, Instagram, and Tiktok all have similarities. Across the board, there are minor differences between the three platforms but not enough that I would classify them as drastically different compared to others. You could argue that Instagram isn\u2019t as popular due to the relatively low percentages compared to Snapchat and Tiktok and you would be right in the fact that there is a five and six-point difference between Instagram and Snapchat and Tiktok. Facebook is by far the least used social media platform and more than sixty percent of participants are not using the platform at all.\n\nOne of the ideas that I tend to wonder about these numbers is if these trials were truly independent from one another meaning that when participants were selected for the survey, were they chosen at random? Yes, it does say that 1,316 teens participated in this survey which is most likely a viable sample size but we don\u2019t know where these participants come from. By not having a random sample, this could introduce unwanted bias into the survey.",

I wonder if Facebook is dying out as a whole, or only targets older generations. Is Youtube more popular than Facebook, or does Youtube just target certain younger generations.\n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis graph demonstrates the impact social media has on teenage lives. I know in my community, I have students in my class who cannot stay off their phone for more than thirty minutes. The need to constantly check social media has become addictive. The graph demonstrates social media's popularity only growing in teenagers' lives. It is important that people implement rules on the amount of screen time teenagers are allowed daily. \n\n4.

Plus, many people use YouTube for entertainment, school, and occasionally to figure out how to do/fix something. I also noticed Facebook was the least used, which makes sense because not many people in my generation have it due to more attractive newer apps. \nI wonder how much these statistics would change if they polled another age group, like people aged forty to sixty. I also wonder how much these statistics will change in the next five, ten or fifteen years. \nAs a high school student and a member of our student senate, I rely on social media to get the word out about many of our events and opportunities. These statistics help me know the best way to reach out to my fellow students, by telling me how likely they are to go on a certain app and see our information. Social media also helps me be more involved in my community, for example on Instagram I can follow our athletics, performing arts, national honor society and so much more, which keeps me actively updated with information and opportunities. Social media also keeps me connected with friends from other schools and family out of state.  My catchy headline would be: How is Our Generation Growing Up With Social Media?",

Since YouTube can be used for a variety of things (music, movies, tutorials, etc.) it would be interesting to see how much each sub category is used. To me, it would make sense that YouTube is the most used \"almost constantly\" since the teenager could be listening to music, something they can't do on other platforms. Similarly, YouTube could be used \"several times a day\" for tutorials and how to videos relating to school or home projects. Because YouTube has such a diverse use, it seems almost unfair to compare it to other social media platforms that have less use among teenagers lives. For example, Facebook. Facebook is used mostly among the older generations. While it can be used as a way of communication and keeping up with people's lives, it can also be used as a marketplace. To teenagers, Facebook is less relevant because there is Snapchat for communication and Instagram for both communication and staying in touch with the world and other's lives.  Teenagers can't buy anything off Facebook, so while it is a unique and nice feature, it is something irrelevant to this age group.",

I also wonder this especially for teens that use them almost constantly, given that it would take most of your time to use many platforms more than several times a day. \n3. Social media addiction is one of the largest problems in recent years, it distracts most teens from school, sports, family, and lots of social interactions in person.

    "comment info": "What do I notice?\n\nFacebook is by far the least-used social media site among teens. Even though TikTok is the most recent app, it is in second place across all five apps. Even though fewer people have Snapchat than Instagram, the people who do have it spend more of their time on it (15% use it almost constantly vs 10% with Instagram). Almost every teenager uses YouTube, which makes sense because it has many applications, like education, long-form entertainment, and short-form entertainment.\n\nWhat do I wonder?\n\nWhat does \"almost constantly\" mean? Does that mean you are using the app every waking hour of your day? Since this was a voluntary survey, how much voluntary response/non-response bias is there? I wonder what the teens who use Facebook use it for? (I know some people who advertise their babysitting/tutoring so parents can see it and don't use it for socializing necessarily.)\u00a0\n\nHow does this affect my community?\n\nIt is clear that many teens spend a large amount of their free time behind a screen, which has been proven to be detrimental to mental health. I also spend a lot of time watching YouTube and on Instagram, so it is interesting to see how many people my age spend even more time online than I do. I think in some ways social media can be a beneficial use of your time, so I think that we as teenagers need to be more aware of when we are just wasting time versus if we are using our time wisely.\n\nTitle:\n\n\"Screenagers by the Numbers\"",

I noticed Youtube is the most used app. 19% of teens use it almost constantly and 41% several times a day. There's a significant amount of people who use it about once a day or less often. It can be concluded that most teens use Youtube daily. Sometimes schools assign Youtube videos for educational purposes. I use Youtube a few times a week for school. TikTok is mostly either used a lot or not at all. This is  because 9% of teens use it once a day and only 9% of teens use ti less often. This shows the addictive nature of TikTok as most teens either use it all of the time or not at all. The same concept applies to Snapchat. As a Snapchat user, I can say that you feel pressured to respond to friends\u2019 snaps which makes you want to check your Snap right away when you get a notification. With Instagram, slightly more teens said that they used it once a day or less often. However, most people still either use Instagram a lot or not at all. Recently, Instagram has become more addictive as it has adopted Instagram reels which are a similar concept to TikTok. Finally, the majority of people do not use Facebook. I feel like this is pretty common because Facebook is a more adult-dominant app. Overall, this is relevant to me because this survey proves just how addictive social media can be and therefore implies the negative effects it will have on our brains. \n\u201cApp Adicttions\u201d",

A graph that shows how much teens use apps like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels would be interesting to see as most of the media consumed by teens today is in that short-form.\n\nThis graph relates to me because I am a part of the group surveyed. Teens my age who use different social media apps will all have similar habits in which apps they use based on what is most popular, and this graph also shows how bad some of those teens can be addicted. I wouldn't say I'm \"almost constantly\" on any app, but the people who gave that answer may be the people who suffer the most from addiction to social media.\n\nThis graph shows what social media platforms are being used by teens today and how much they're being used, so my own title for the graph would be \"How much of a teen's day is spent on social media?\"",

I notice that the two apps with the lowest \"less often\" and \"about once a day\" columns are TikTok and Snapchat. This makes sense because both apps are commonly used to take up time, so it is not unusual for teens to use them several times a day. I also notice that Facebook is the least used, and this makes sense because Facebook is one of the oldest platforms, used mostly by the older generations of Millennials, Gen X, and Baby Boomers. Because I don't notice friends or people around me using Youtube a lot, I wonder if these statistics were taken from ALL use on every platform. I wonder if a lot of teenagers watch Youtube so much because of educational videos for school, and less for \"fun\"/non-school related videos. This relates to me and my community because most of these platforms consist of short, quick videos and pictures. I have seen statistics that videos and pictures like these lower my generation's attention span, and I wonder what our future will be like if we can only keep out attention on something for 10 seconds or less. \n\"Teenagers & Social Media\"",

It is interesting to see how large a percentage of teens use YouTube, as it is not what I would have expected to be the highest. This goes to show how normal the usage of the site has become that it does not even cross my mind as a time killer. The graph also gives an interesting perspective on how younger people gravitate toward content. Platforms based on videos have the majority of users while picture-based platforms are less used. This could speak to the lowered attention spans of teens now and how they much more stimulation to stay in a site. Both of these findings pertain to me because I use social media and gravitate toward TikTok and Instagram over other sites.

I found it interesting that the three most popular platforms chosen by students were video platforms rather than snapchat, instagram, and facebook, which typically show pictures. I wonder why only 32% of Tennagers reported using Tiktok while 41% reported using YouTube multiple times a day. Youtube videos are typically more time consuming and longer than a short 15 second to minute tiktok video, so I was surprised that it was used more frequently.  This is important to me and my community because I am a teen growing up in a generation where everyone is addicted to and consumes social media on a daily basis. I think it's interesting to see how teens in my own age groups feel about social media.\n\nTitle: \"Social media is an epidemic\"",

Facebook isn't very shocking since more adults tend to use that app, but I was very surprised to see that youtube is the most used app. I expected it to be either Tik Tok or Instagram. What I wonder is how will social media affect our generation in the long run? Will brain power be the same as the current working adults? Social media has many risks to it and has been a very big problem for sources of online bullying as well. What is going on in this graph is it is trying to show how many teenagers truly spend their time using social media daily and additionally, converting it into statistics to make people more aware of it. Multiple times a day, teenagers, myself included, mindlessly scroll through different apps for our own enjoyment, without thinking about the consequences. We need to come to terms with some of the unhealthy side effects it can have when we are older. This relates to my community because since I am in high school, I am surrounded by pretty much only teenagers and we are all addicted to our phones and checking social media constantly, without even realizing it. These statistics could help to encourage teenagers to take a step back and realize how much time is spent on platforms such as these.  \nCatchy Headline:\nWhat is inside the teenage brain:",

I notice how TikTok is second under YouTube and that teenagers say they almost constantly use TikTok at 16%. I wonder why YouTube is the most used social media platform because I grew out of that phase, but I guess others have not. I also wonder if this affects teenagers' brains and mental/physical health since it seems that most of a teen's time is spent on social media rather than activities or hobbies. This graph shows how much teenagers use social media pretty much 24/7 every day of the week. The screen-time itself can be damaging to one's brain cells and stimulate them which can cause a lack of sleep in many teens. Also, the risks of cyber-bullying, kidnapping, sex trafficking, depression, anxiety, and suicide rates are proven to stem from social media. There are benefits as teenagers can connect/communicate with friends and family, get a new cookie recipe, or watch a TV show. It depends on the person you talk to to get their take on social media. This affects me and my community because as I have mentioned before I am a teenager who uses all of these social media apps, except for YouTube and Facebook, and sees the positive and negative effects. I wish I wouldn't waste time scrolling on TikTok aimlessly instead of doing my GOPO graph but I'm just a teenage girl. \nSuper Catchy Title: \"I'm Just A Teenage Girl\"",

They're both some of the oldest social media platforms, so why is one so popular, while the other is losing popularity with the youth? Maybe this is because it's easier to make entertaining content on YouTube. Many YouTubers are household names, but no one knows any famous Facebookers. \nThis graph relates heavily to me, because I often find myself hooked on social media.

Most teens that I know rather the short clips that Tik Tok offers because the constant scrolling is very stimulating for those with poor attention spans. \n\nI wonder if teens were being completely honest when researchers where collecting data from them, because from the teens I know are almost constantly using these social media apps.\n\nThis relates to me and my community because most people I know are addicted to social media and less kids are being social in person because these apps are a substitute for that.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph is that they are showing the amount of times teens use social media.

It also shows how many teens use social media in general as in the graph many teens use these social media apps multiple times a day. This relates to me a lot but also doesn't at the same time, let me explain. Yes I am a teen on the internet that uses the internet a lot but the only platform I use from this graph is youtube and I only use that to mainly listen to music when playing games or watch videos to just help me through a rough day or just to relax. I know how the internet has affected teens as I have seen many examples of that online and in real life, some ways it has affected teens can be good but some aren't really the best. It can show teens new interests that they didn't know that they had but also it can effect them negatively with dangerous challenges that they think they can do easily and it ends up with them getting hurt or worse. that's why I just stick to youtube because I dont like any other social media platforms due to either toxic people, dumb challenges that can get people hurt, or other things.

I also noticed and expected Facebook to have the least amount of teen users with only around 3% of them using this platform \"almost constantly\". This data made me wonder what \"almost constantly\" really means to these teens, and what this means in terms of hours per day. Since this data was also collected in 2022, I wonder if COVID had an impact on this. I also wonder if Spring break impacted these numbers as well. As many teens tend to be on social media on any time off they can get. Today, everyone is almost constantly on their phone. To the point where many people feel as if they couldn't live without it! This is partially concerning as it can make it difficult for people to separate their phone activity from their day to day lives. Although it comes with many benefits and can teach us so much, like simply how to fix something around the house or begin a new hobby. Many young teens abuse these platforms scrolling for hours on end. \n\nHeadline: Social media, what consumes you compared to today's typical teen?",

This highlights the large percentage of teens who use social media platforms at least once a day. The majority of teens in every section use these apps several times a day or almost constantly. This graph could be used to compare against other evidence or texts that examine the outcomes of this increased social media presence in teens. This is very relatable to me because I am a teenager on social media. I fall into the category of using some of these social media apps about once a day or several times a day. I wonder how many correlations can be made between different diagnoses or negative impacts on the lives of teens. I think this topic is very interesting because there is not a lot of long-term research on the impacts of having access to all these types of social media. I would name this graph \"Teen Social Media Use: Where Do You Fall?\"",

The detrimental things are though is media manipulation. We don\u2019t absolutely know if this news is true or not. Teens have grown up with social media and it seems that Facebook is becoming more outdated by the day. Over 3/4 don\u2019t use it, maybe due to the \u201cdated\u201d feeling of the platform. YouTube might be questioned as a social media as people can use it as a resource to learn but also learn about current events. TikTok, and instagram are constant scrolling, click through platforms, mind numbing even. Snapchat is more of a communication platform which is surprising to see it has the same usage rates as TikTok and instagram. What I wonder is who almost doesn\u2019t use YouTube, it\u2019s not seen as a \u201csocial media\u201d too much and more of just a video platform. And with the recent release of TikTok, compared to the tenured instagram and Snapchat, it still has more overall teens using it than Snapchat and instagram. This definitely makes an impact in my community as so many people use social media as an outlet of stress and entertainment. We are worried though that constant and repeated use will break our minds.\n\nHeadline: \u201cHow \u201cSocial\u201d are these social medias in teens?\u201d",

I noticed that in general, the most commonly used platform out of the 5 was YouTube as the percentages for using it almost constantly at 19% and several times a day at 41% were significantly higher than the percentages in those categories for all the other social media platforms. Additionally, I noticed that Facebook has the greatest percentage of teens not using the platform at all with 67% in that category which is significantly higher than the percentages in the same category for different social media platforms. I also noticed that this graph is for the age range of 13-17 year olds and wonder how the results of this graph would be different for an adult group or group of younger children. I also wonder why YouTube has so much higher usage than something such as Facebook and think it may be due to the types of audiences reached. For example, apps like Facebook categorize a user\u2019s feed based on their networks, but with apps such as YouTube, it is easier for creators to reach a wider audience quickly. This relates to my community because I use social media and it has become almost an essential in society. It is interesting to see how my usage of social media compares to the results of the graph.

From the data, I noticed that social media platforms that include some form of video were ranked higher on how much time teens spend on the app. This is because YouTube and TikTok are structured on videos (TikTok usually with shorter videos and YouTube with a range of lengths). I wonder what form of media teenagers are viewing most on social media platforms. This is because Youtube can be used for educational purposes as well as for entertainment. Also I am curious because there is a range of interests that can be catered to an individual on social media. Additionally, I wonder  how the amount of time spent on social media ranges for each age (the graph is currently a combination of 13 to 17 year-olds). As a member of generation Z, social media has been a large part of my life growing up. The data relates to my community as social media platforms like YouTube may be heavily used by members of my generation, but then change (like Facebook and Twitter) and newer platforms may be more popular later on. The amount of time my generation spends on social media is also concerning not only because it can hinder brain development. \n\nTeens Should #Limit Social Media Use",

Were most of the surveyed teens from the United States or elsewhere? Or is it a large range of countries?

Additionally, are specific social media platforms more popular in some countries than others? For example, teens using Facebook in the United States is a rarity, but maybe it is popular among teens in Switzerland.

YouTube is the most used platform studied and Facebook is the least used platform studied because only 5% of teens do not use YouTube and 67% of teens do not use Facebook.

I wonder if these results are accurate or if these respondents have succumbed to zombie scrolling and are unaware of how much they use social media. I would respond by saying that I am not a constant social media user. But, according to my Apple screen time report, I used social media for around a total of 30 hours last week. In my community, I see how addicted teenagers around me are to social media. In school, students will step out of class to use the restroom but bring their phones to answer snap chats, DMS, or even just watch a few TikToks before heading back to class.

Therefore, we turn to other social media applications, such as TikTok, which has drastically increased in popularity over the past few years. The graph depicts TikTok as the second most used application following YouTube for first place. \n\n2. I wonder how social media platforms differ in their utilization of algorithms\u2014 rules, and data that determine how content is filtered and recommended to its users, to keep their users addicted. For example, I wonder if FaceBook uses less effective, outdated algorithms because it doesn't appeal as much as YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram toward younger populations. \n\n3. This graph is relatable to me and my community because we are teenagers, who have not known a life without the internet. Many of us have been exposed to social media at early ages, typically beginning with watching YouTube videos as toddlers. As we have grown older and been given cell phones, the majority of us download social media platforms. There are copious amounts of studies on the benefits and harmful effects of the rise of social media on teenagers. But, this graph serves as a neutral source, which simply informs its audience on how often teenagers ranging from ages 13 to 17 use five major social media platforms.\n\n4.

Furthermore, I noticed that video-focused sites such as YouTube and TikTok are the two most popular among teens, with 19% and 16% of teens constantly using them, respectively, compared to the rest of social media.\n- I wonder how much the substance within these sites contributes to their overall use among teens, with platforms more centered around videos, such as TikTok and Youtube, being higher while more communication-based social media, such as Snapchat and Instagram, are lower in comparison.\n- This relates to me and my community, being that social media runs rampant in the lives of my peers and me. Many spend the majority of their day consumed by social media, causing a real problem in the overall productivity of teens' day-to-day lives.

I feel that people also constantly use TikTok because the platform has expanded outside of just entertainment. For many, it serves as a news source and a cheap place to purchase the hottest items with the release of \"TikTok Shop\". To answer your question, I think this is why TikTok is a more popular social media app than others. It is more than just dancing videos and funny storytimes now. TikTok has broadened its horizon to keep people on the app. When they are done watching videos, they can shop. When they are done shopping, they can tap into news sources to see what is going on in the world. When they get depressed from all the negative news, they go back to entertainment to find solitude.

I notice that TikTok and SnapChat are very similar in the number percentages. I wonder how parental guidance plays into the answers, because I know younger teenagers, like 13, may have rules about social media imposed on them, while older teenagers, 18 and 19, can typically make their own decisions and not be influenced by their parents.

Although, I feel like the rise of social media was inevitable, especially with constant technological developments throughout history. However, this is how I feel like what would occur: Without social media, the world might experience a shift in communication dynamics, relying more on traditional methods like face-to-face interactions, phone calls, and emails. This would also make humans depend on more genuine connections instead of ones that are blinded behind a screen. But with the absence of social media, it makes me wonder what would happen instead of online harassment and cyberbullying.",

I also noticed a lot of teens are not participating in some mainstream media in numbers higher than many thought.\n\n2.) Why do teens spend so much more time on YouTube than on other social media? Could this change be generational?\n\n3.) This relates to me and my community as a whole through the social media we use.

How did this happen?'\n\nWe noticed:\nFrom April 14th to May 4th, 2022, a survey took place for teenagers asking how often they use social media platforms. When the results came back, YouTube had many teenagers using it over other platforms. It had the highest percentage who used it constantly, several times a day, once a day, or least often. The next most popular platform was TikTok, a newer platform in the US since 2018, and it is still rising in popularity. Other popular apps like Snapchat and Instagram didn't have nearly the same numbers as YouTube in each category, but Facebook was the one that fell short the most with 67% of teens not using it.\n\nOur wonder:\nWhat makes these apps much more familiar among teenagers than apps like Facebook and Twitter, which are also fairly popular?\n\nOur relation:\nAs teenagers, we might use some of the apps in this list and know what it's like to use them all day or throughout the day.\nTeenagers might know better than adults about why these apps are so entertaining, considering we use them so much.",

Watching PBS and MTV are different experiences, interestingly you can watch PBS on YouTube without being interrupted by commercials, similarly many non profits have channels that also don\u2019t require commercials and aren\u2019t subject to the same internal bias that comes with needing sponsors, whereas the other platforms make commercials unavoidable.\n\nI\u2019m comforted that young people spend the most time on YouTube but I still think it doesn\u2019t belong in the survey.",
