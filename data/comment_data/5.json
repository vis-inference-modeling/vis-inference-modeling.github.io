It's not a surprise to me just because the internet is one of the biggest things that everyone is connected to.

I believe the one big reason why everyone shops online is because it's faster and you don't have to deal with other people in the store. Online shopping is especially helpful during the holidays because they're aren't huge lines to wait in. I won't be surprised if department or warehouse stores completely fall through in the next decade. Technology is becoming so much more advanced that I don't even know what is going to happen next.",

I notice that there seems to be a steady growth in E-commerce, and a steady decline in department stores. Retail industry in total is all across the board, dipping low between 2008 and 2010. I wonder if the growth in the E-commerce industry is related to the growth in online shopping these days, deals like cyber-Monday and black Friday online could possible pertain to this growth. I wonder if the dip between 2008 and 2010 was caused by the Great Recession that took place during these years. You could probably find more answers to these questions by doing more research on the job growth then and job growth now. Overall, I think that these graphs show that online E-commerce is a growing industry all due to the fact that we live in a technology-run world today.",

I wonder the underlying causes of the steady decline of department stores, in particular. E-commerce is an extremely fast and convenient way to shop, but I had no idea that it was this much stronger than other forms of retail.

Companies like Amazon, instead of having employees run the business, have shifted physical retailers on to the interwebs. Instead, the need for backend jobs such as working at a ecommerce distribution center, supply chain management, software/website designer has increased steadily. The direct correlation with e-commerce and warehouse workers shows the increase in these jobs too. Whether it be for own good, it is apparent that our retail sector is shifting from physical purchases to online. If your working retail, you might be outnumbered by ecommerce workers soon.",

The total retail industry has increased from 2002 to 2008, but decreased until 2010. After 2010, the  job offerings increased rapidly increased. The other graph shows the percentage of job offering that each group offered over the 15 years. Although, e-commerce does not offer the most amount of jobs, it's percentage increased the most from 0 to 300% within the last fifteen years. I think what this may imply is that people are wanting to obtain better jobs because department stores don't offer as much money compared to warehouses and clubs. Since there's been significant increase in e-commerce, people are beginning to prefer working from home.\n\nI wonder why the total retail industry declined from 2008 to 2010. Was there some sort mild depression that led to unemployment? Why are more jobs offered to warehouses and clubs rather than e-commerce? \n\nNot only do the people prefer to have better salary, warehouses, clubs and e-commerce require more people. Today, more people want to everything online, because it's cheaper, faster, and easier. That's why e-commerce has increased the most out of all other companies. I think e-commerce will eventually overtake warehouse/clubs employment, because of its rapid exponential progression.",

However, graph A reveals the net change of the jobs and stores, while graph B depicts the percentage change. The scales (y-axis) of the graphs are quite different, thus a clear comparison with distinct numbers will be unlikely.\nThe two graphs show a decrease of department stores; however, the rates of the decrease are significantly different. In graph A, the decrease is over 500 in some areas; while the graph B shows a general decrease a general of less than 100. Graph A shows a gradually increase of e- commerce, while graph B shows a faster one within the time frame. The large scale of graph A makes it very hard to decide how much the e- commerce has risen, while graph B shows a 300 increase.\nThere is a rise in the total retail industry on both graphs, but there is a very slight increase seen on graph B. The increase of the total industry of graph A was seen with a rise over 500,000. The same idea is presented in the rise of warehouse clubs and others.\nThese results are in response of new technology that allows one to buy ideas online much easier.

This shows that retail is gaining more consumer demand. There has been a gradual decrease in the amount of retail jobs at department stores. In the real world, some of the major department stores such as Sears are starting to go out of business. This implies that there is a trend of retail jobs shifting from department stores to online or warehouse clubs.\nLooking at the second graph, I noticed that the E-commerce part of retail is exponentially increasing. This might be due to the growing popularity of online shopping and online delivery. The jobs at warehouse clubs are also increasing. The size of the retail industry has remained fairly constant, with years where they lost jobs and years it gained jobs. This implies that the retail industry is shifting away from department stores and toward the online forms of shopping. The ease and efficiency of online shopping has been increasing over the past few years. This can be seen by the growing size of the E-commerce side of the industry.

I believe the one big reason why everyone shops online is because it's faster and you don't have to deal with other people in the store. Online shopping is especially helpful during the holidays because they're aren't huge lines to wait in.

I wonder if the growth in the E-commerce industry is related to the growth in online shopping these days, deals like cyber-Monday and black Friday online could possible pertain to this growth. I wonder if the dip between 2008 and 2010 was caused by the Great Recession that took place during these years. You could probably find more answers to these questions by doing more research on the job growth then and job growth now.

While other forms of retail, including department stores and warehouse clubs, have remained largely the same in percentage change in jobs (graph B), E-commerce has been shooting up over the last decade and a half. It's especially interesting to see that the overall retail industry was vacillating between high and low points (graph A), but again, E-commerce remained steady. I wonder the underlying causes of the steady decline of department stores, in particular. E-commerce is an extremely fast and convenient way to shop, but I had no idea that it was this much stronger than other forms of retail. Overall, these graphs prove the common theme that our world is becoming increasingly technology-based and the new innovations that have arisen through this new world approach have far-reaching influences on our lives.

Companies like Amazon, instead of having employees run the business, have shifted physical retailers on to the interwebs. Instead, the need for backend jobs such as working at a ecommerce distribution center, supply chain management, software/website designer has increased steadily.

The other graph shows the percentage of job offering that each group offered over the 15 years. Although, e-commerce does not offer the most amount of jobs, it's percentage increased the most from 0 to 300% within the last fifteen years. I think what this may imply is that people are wanting to obtain better jobs because department stores don't offer as much money compared to warehouses and clubs. Since there's been significant increase in e-commerce, people are beginning to prefer working from home.\n\nI wonder why the total retail industry declined from 2008 to 2010. Was there some sort mild depression that led to unemployment? Why are more jobs offered to warehouses and clubs rather than e-commerce? \n\nNot only do the people prefer to have better salary, warehouses, clubs and e-commerce require more people. Today, more people want to everything online, because it's cheaper, faster, and easier. That's why e-commerce has increased the most out of all other companies. I think e-commerce will eventually overtake warehouse/clubs employment, because of its rapid exponential progression.",

However, graph A reveals the net change of the jobs and stores, while graph B depicts the percentage change. The scales (y-axis) of the graphs are quite different, thus a clear comparison with distinct numbers will be unlikely.\nThe two graphs show a decrease of department stores; however, the rates of the decrease are significantly different. In graph A, the decrease is over 500 in some areas; while the graph B shows a general decrease a general of less than 100. Graph A shows a gradually increase of e- commerce, while graph B shows a faster one within the time frame. The large scale of graph A makes it very hard to decide how much the e- commerce has risen, while graph B shows a 300 increase.\nThere is a rise in the total retail industry on both graphs, but there is a very slight increase seen on graph B. The increase of the total industry of graph A was seen with a rise over 500,000. The same idea is presented in the rise of warehouse clubs and others.\nThese results are in response of new technology that allows one to buy ideas online much easier.

This shows that retail is gaining more consumer demand. There has been a gradual decrease in the amount of retail jobs at department stores. In the real world, some of the major department stores such as Sears are starting to go out of business. This implies that there is a trend of retail jobs shifting from department stores to online or warehouse clubs.\nLooking at the second graph, I noticed that the E-commerce part of retail is exponentially increasing. This might be due to the growing popularity of online shopping and online delivery. The jobs at warehouse clubs are also increasing. The size of the retail industry has remained fairly constant, with years where they lost jobs and years it gained jobs. This implies that the retail industry is shifting away from department stores and toward the online forms of shopping. The ease and efficiency of online shopping has been increasing over the past few years. This can be seen by the growing size of the E-commerce side of the industry.

I also notice that jobs fro E-commerce and Warehouse Clubs and others has always increased, jobs for Departments stores has always decreased, and total retail jobs has been cyclical, initially starting off by increasing in jobs. This implies that the world is shifting to buying more in bulk and online.\n\nI wonder why department store jobs has only decreased even though total retail jobs has increased tremendously over the past 7 years. I also wonder how E-commerce has increased so rapidly compared to other forms of retailers. This information could be found by doing research in the different fields and calculating total revenue earned by a single industry annually.\n\nThe story this graph is telling me is that the world, while it is transitioning to an ever-increasingly tech-based world, it is also shifting its consumption to online methods, notably Amazon.",

As the number warehouses increased, the number of department stores fell as well. \n\nI wonder why the total number of department store stores would decrease, but the overall retail industry would flourish. I also wonder why the second graph shows the industry as almost no increase when the first one shows a noticeable growth. \n\nAs an explanation, I would think that the industry continues to increase, because the online business has increased. This would explain why the industry increases and the total amount of department stores decreases.",

In graph B, there is a very large percentage change in online or e-commerce retail jobs; however, the total retail industry does not significantly change. The graph only shows the three main variables of E-commerce, Warehouse clubs, and Department stores, but it also includes \"25 other retail sectors\" . The absence of these other sectors puts E-commerce, Warehouse clubs, and Department stores in direct comparison with each other. \n\nWhen analyzing the graphs, I thought the selection of which sectors to include was interesting. These three sectors are the main industries that people think about in retail. Seeing the rise in online retail jobs, I wonder how many other industries see this same increase, and if any industries actually experience a decrease in online occupation opportunities. \n\nThis graph explains the decrease in department stores' marks on the retail industry, and online/warehouse jobs rising in its place. Graph B shows the total retail industry keeping a constant, with no significant percent change. This is evidence that the rise in e-commerce and warehouse clubs are increasingly taking the place of department stores, as well as the 25 other retail sectors that are all decreasing in percentage. By itself, department stores do not account for all of the decrease in the retail industry. There are actually many more sectors that are also losing their places to e-commerce.",

It was interesting to us that warehouse club (and others? what is that?) jobs have also increased over the last 15 years. It was also intriguing that the net loss in department store and the \"other 25 retail sectors\" jobs caused a dramatic loss of jobs overall from 2008-2012. We think the story that this graph is telling is that there actually, interestingly enough, has been an increase in the retail jobs over the last 15 years, but the location of those retail jobs has shifted to online retails and warehouse clubs. From 2008-2012, there was a dip, presumably as the industry shifted.",

Department store jobs have shown a decrease from both graphs.  I'd expect the the large percent growth of jobs for E-commerce to be due to its rapid growth in modern society, and going from a relatively small number to a large one to accommodate the huge increase of people it needs to serve while the net change didn't seem so big in the grand scheme of things.  Would expect warehouse club net change to be so great because for each warehouse club kind of store, a lot of staff is needed which is why its change seems so much bigger.\n\nI wonder if there is any correlation between the growth of E-Commrce jobs and the growth of jobs in warehouse clubs or if its coincidental.  I would also like to know what is driving up the need for positions in warehouse clubs.  E-commerce is hurting department stores due to convenience, but is the growth of warehouse clubs also affecting the decline in department stores?\n\nThe graph is showing the change in different retail services  over fifteen years.

There seems to be a correlation between the number of e-commerce jobs and total retail jobs because of a rapid growth in e-commerce, despite warehouse club jobs increasing at a steady rate. It also seems that the once prominent department store jobs have seen a decline over the years.\n\nI wonder if said decline in department store jobs, as well as the decline in the net percent growth of the 25 other retail sectors, has to do with the growing popularity and accessibility of the e-commerce industry. It looks like the ease and lack of physical shopping e-commerce offers is the preferred alternative of society today. \n\nThese graphs tell the story of e-commerce cultivating into its own convenient niche in the retail industry. While it provides a better alternative to department store chains that requires one to physically travel to shop, I do not believe e-commerce has grown to a point where it can render warehouse stores the inferior option. This seems to be partly due to the notion that when it comes to purchasing in bulk, there is a level of trust gained from purchasing packs of water or a large piece of furniture in person, rather than online where you cannot physically check for deficiencies on a larger scale.",

It is clear that these positions are much more popular today than they were in 2002. I also notice the declining slope of department store jobs, indicating their decrease in popularity. Overall, the total retail industry has seen an increase since 2002, but has experienced intermittent decline (for example, in 2008 we see the slope plummet exponentially, likely due to the stock market crash of 2008). \n\nI can infer that the increasing number of retail positions in Ecommerce and Warehouse clubs is because of their increased utilization and popularity. Both online and in large stores, wide varieties of merchandise are available, easily accessible, and much cheaper than in department stores, making them the sought after option. Because online shopping and warehouse stores receive many customers and transactions, they require larger staffs to satisfy the needs of the store. The more successful they are, the more chains can be opened, hence increasing the workforce even further.  The recent unpopularity of department stores is likely due to people turning to these cheaper alternatives; hence, the more ecommerce and warehouse clubs dominate the retail industry, the more department store shopping will decline. Less traffic in department stores requires less staffing, and therefore, fewer jobs.",

As Maggie Hall says, \u201cThe traditional approach of demonstrate-and-persuade is not applicable when you can\u2019t talk to customers face to face.\u201d  You noted increases and decreases in jobs, but check out the titles of the graphs.  How do the graphs relate to each other?  Keep digging.",

    "comment info": "I notice on Graph A that the x-axis is going by two years in which the Total Retail Industry experienced the most amount of variability going from 2002, going from the negative numbers to above the +500,000 mark. However, the Warehouse Clubs and E-commerce increased, but the Warehouse clubs had the most increasing net change. In Graph B, I noticed that the graph is now in percentage change, which made it seem like E-commerce had the largest increase, while the Warehouse had significantly less.\n     I wonder how the Warehouse club has the most significant increase because we are in the age of technology and innovation. I wonder what the Total Retail Industry did to increase their net change over the course of 2002 to 2016.\n     The story that the graph represents is the increase and decline of many shopping markets throughout the course of 14 years",

This is only one of the many reasons this industry has been increasing over the past 15 years. This more items, faster view also is a result of the high percentage change in retail jobs over the last 15 years. Why drive somewhere to a store that might have your item, when you can shop for it and buy it from the comfort of your home?",

However, I am surprised that total retail industry has not decreased that much. Department stores are expected to decrease in jobs because of people choosing to purchase online, and exc. E-commerce has over a 300% increase and warehouse clubs have had a 100% increase. However, for graph A, I am surprised by the low E-commerce increase in retail jobs. However, considering that E-commerce is online transactions, workers aren't necessarily required.",

E-commerce has increased significantly because of the rise of internet shopping while department stores have decreased because everyone wants shopping to be easy. I wonder if sites like Amazon, eBay, Walmart Online, etc. have run the department stores out of business. Why is the total retail industry rising if major department stores are declining?",

This is probably due to the rise of stores such as Amazon, E-Bay, and Craigslist. As more and more people are finding the comfort in shopping at home, less people are going to the mall and buying products. This graph represents the constant, growing incline in online shopping, and the decline in retail jobs.",

Total retail industry has dips and rises, but it does, overall, have a positive net change. E-commerce started out small and slowly grew. E-commerce never dipped below 0, but it didn't have large growth. Department stores, however, has dipped below 0, and it has never came back up. I believe that department stores are going \"out of fashion\" as the line for department stores is sinking. In graph B, another image is being captured. In Graph A, warehouse clubs and other trumped all other retail jobs. However, in Graph B, E-commerce easily beats out all other retail jobs, which I expected all along. Warehouse clubs and other still rises steadily. Total retail industry barely rises above 0. Department stores stays below 0, just as I expected again. Overall, the only change between the two graphs is that E-commerce has a higher percentage change than Warehouse clubs and other.",

Also, the retail industry has the second net change in retail jobs over the last 15 years. This may be because of the rise of the industry this time of year. I notice on Graph B that E-commerce has the most percentage change in retail jobs over the last 15 years this may be because jobs are needed in their warehouses and other shifts in the company.\nI wonder why the e-commerce has the least positive change over the last 15 years. I would expect that it would be the most because of the rise of Amazon, and many other e-commerce companies. I also wonder why the total retail industry is rising. Maybe as the population of the world increases, the need for clothes increasing. Maybe in the near future the retail industry will move to e-commerce but, I believe that trying and buying clothes will still be something to watch for in the future.\nThe story these graphs are telling us is the decline of regular department and the rise of e-commerce and online shopping, shown in both Graph A and B. Jobs that used to be in Department stores have shifted to e-commerce. This graph was justified by Black Friday where online shopping sharply rose.  This is what's going on in this graph.",
