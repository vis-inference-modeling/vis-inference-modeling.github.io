There is no more ignoring and hoping it will go away. It\u2019s not worth the detriment to our world for the  \u201ccomfort\u201d we get from deluding ourselves that there is not a crisis happening.",

But the message is clear with a first glance, we need to do more than read and understand the issue. We need to get engaged now, elect leaders who will address the climate crisis, join effective grassroots organizations, change our own behavior and talk about the climate crisis.",
