There is by far, a much larger increase in people of color than in whites overall and the main area where white population has increased, is in the area from Louisiana to North Carolina. The blue arrows, representing people of color, are mostly concentrated around big cities on the map. \nI wonder what exactly defines the increase. Are they talking about a population increase of people of color versus those who are white? Or is it just an area increase, meaning that maybe the reason there\u2019s so much increase on the east is because they all moved from the west? What is causing such an increase in people of color and why is there very little growth on the west side of the map?

In particular, there has been a lot of growth in the POC population in the midwest and the east. The blue arrows are most concentrated around large cities on the map. Additionally, counties with longer arrows, or more growth, are concentrated around cities also. While growth in POC can be seen across the entire map, that of the white population is limited to a few areas. Mainly, the share of the white population in the southeast. \n\nTo start, I wonder what is prompting the substantial growth in the POC population. Besides the concentration of this growth around large cities, I am intrigued by how evenly this growth is distributed in other parts of the map in the Midwest and the east coast. On the other hand, I wonder why there is far less growth in the western part of the United, especially California which I believe has one of the highest if not the highest minority populations in the U.S.\n\nThis relates to me and my community as an Asian American living in a white-dominated area. It is nice to visually see the significant increase in the POC population and process that the areas we live in are becoming more diverse. As the POC population increases, hopefully, that will parallel their representation and inclusion.\n\nWhat direction has diversity in American been going in the past 10 years?",

In every state the population of people of color increased, whereas the white population only increased in a few. I also noticed that on the East Coast there is greater amounts of population growth compared to the Midwest and West Coast. I also notice that the majority of the white population increase shown on this graph is in southern states like Texas, South Carolina, and Georgia.

It makes me wonder if this increase spiked during the pandemic, simply because of government aid.  From what I have read, government aid increased during the pandemic when there were more dependents within a family.  With that being said, it sort of encourages the idea of increasing your family, without putting thought into it, to receive more government aid.  That would be an interesting concept to explore amongst those who were eligible for aid during the peak of the pandemic.",

In just about every location in the U.S., the share of people of color has increased. This is especially true in the eastern half of the country where the density of blue arrows is greater. Cities like Atlanta and New York City also seem to be filled with blue. The only areas where the share of the white population increased was dotted in places around Texas, South Carolina, Georgia, and a little bit of Louisiana. I wonder what the primary cause of this is. Is it because of immigration? Is it because of a difference in birth rates among different racial populations? Is it because of different groups of people moving across the country to different places? I live in Illinois, one of the places shown to have increasing diversity in the graph as evidenced by the density of arrows.

This graph makes it hard not to wonder, why is there such a drastic number of people of color vs white. You would think they would be similar or almost equal. This hypothesis is proved completely wrong by this graph. I would assume these results are due to interracial marriages, and more pull to the USA from other foreign countries that are declining. For example most white people come from Europe where it is easy to make a living. Where as colored people could be from third world countries who would do anything to get the chance to come to America. I personally come from an Indian decent and can see how this makes sense.

There was one cluster of tracts in the southeastern coastal states that saw an increase to the contrary, with white growth exceeding that of POC, as well as a few outliers scattered around the country seemingly at random. It makes me wonder as to what could be the cause of that clustering of data in the southeast that went against the trend. Perhaps certain immigration trends there, or simply an existing population makeup that is overwhelmingly white. I\u2019m also curious about what are likely the long term effects of this trend, politically and socially. Mostly, I hypothesize that the change that is occurring and that will likely continue to occur is generally positive. From what this graph shows, in some time the voter bases in most places will be composed of significantly more POC, although obviously some delay from the census is likely. Maybe minorities becoming a somewhat larger component of the population will help speed along social and political reforms for some of society\u2019s race related issues, such as institutional racism in police departments that there has been such a huge movement to fix lately. Certainly even in my own community I can catch a glimpse of some of these issues, and the reform movements that come along with them. \u201cColored population swell brings hope for future reforms\u201d",

Could it be due to surges in immigration?This relates to my community because I can see in the graph that my area in particular has grown in diversity, which is something I hadn\u2019t noticed. It\u2019s interesting to be informed of this trend now, and now possibly be able to notice the change in diversity around me. I would title this graph \u201cA Decade of Diversity Uptake\u201d.",

However, some red arrows display that the share of the white population has increased; These red arrows are mostly spread out and oftentimes are due simply to chance. One may notice, though, that The Texas-Mexico border is drastically increasing their white population, and parts of South Carolina & Georgia too. Don\u2019t be mistaken by the graph\u2019s design, there are many smaller counties in the Eastern states compared to the Western states. This could potentially convey a wrong message that the West has barely been supporting diversity because the East is covered in many more green arrows. I also think that the designer\u2019s choice of green being an increase in PoC per capita and red is an increase in white population per capita shows their stance on diversity. \n\nOne of the main outliers in the widespread increase in diversity is the Texas-Mexico border. I wonder why their share of the white population has increased. We should also take into account the Census\u2019 way of measuring these groups, how these definitions changed, and the graph designer\u2019s choice to only measure White vs. PoC changes. Due to the county's proximity to Mexico, it\u2019s interesting that there are more non-Hispanic whites. Perhaps people who have identified as Latino rather than Non-Hispanic white have entered those neighborhoods? (1/2)",

What is the reasoning (that is common between two different states) that caused a net increase in the white population in these two tracts?\n\nThis relates to my and my community as we can understand where we as a country are headed in terms of acceptance.

This pattern occurs specifically along the South Eastern coast. On the East coast, the trend begins in Maryland, continuing down southwards through Virginia, the Carolinas, and Florida. On the Southern coast, these states include Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas. I think a possible explanation for this pattern is that these states may have areas with predominantly white communities, pr  are possibly more isolated, resulting in an increase of white populations. Another surprise for me was that nearly all the counties in America experienced a greater increase in colored populations. I expected the percent increase of white and colored populations to be more or less balanced. I wonder, why is there such a drastic difference?

I would think that whites and non-whites would have similar rates of growth, but the graph clearly shows that there was a vast disparate increase in minority population when compared with whites in the past ten years. Of course I suppose these changes could be due to immigration and interracial marriages and multi-ethnic children.

I wonder why the POC population increases in some states more than others. I'd assume it was due to the overall diversity of a state's population, but on the other hand, a state like Arkansas with predominantly white towns that are known to be extremely racist and hateful towards the BIPOC community have still experienced increases in people of color. I guess this would unfortunately lead to even more discrimination and hate toward BIPOC and other people of color.\n\n3. Although the number of people of color in the U.S. has signifcantly increased over time (and still continues to increase), we still experience increasing rates of racism and discrimination. Specifically the BIPOC community experiences a disproportionate amount of racism, despite the diversifying population. I am disgusted by the amount of racism and hate that is still prevalent in society, and will continue to emphasize the importance of advocating for change and social justice.\n\n4.

This implies that the populations of POC (people of color) have definitely increased; in other words, diversity throughout the U.S. has gone up. I find it interesting that changes in white populations on the other hand have stayed relatively the same in comparison. This makes me wonder about the different factors that may have influenced non-white communities to expand away from the western states. I also think it is interesting that states like Georgia, that have historically been largely populated with people of color, has started to see an equally amount of increases in white communities. I'm also thinking if there will be any negative impacts in the long run with more people crowding into a specific area of the U.S. (e.g. overpopulation in cities).\u00a0\n\nThese changes in diversity relates to my community when considering how the area I live in is populated with a large white population.

I also find it interesting to notice that, although it is only by a tiny amount, there is still some rate of people of color increasing in Alaska which I personally thought there would be none. This makes me wonder how much this rate in Alaska will change over more periods of time. I also wonder what made the rate of the population of people of color increase more on the east coast.

The number of arrows have to do with the number of counties by state as well as whether the change in diversity by county was greater than 1 percent.  \n\nDo you think the states in the West have fewer arrows because there are fewer counties and/or there is very little change in diversity?  (Note the length of the arrows in the West.)",

This could be just a random choice but I wonder if it has to do with white people typically being Republicans (red) and people of color typically leaning left (represented by blue, just like the arrows do). I wonder if the arrows mean that Americans of color are moving into different states, or more people are immigrating to the United States.\u00a0The Northeast, where we live is becoming more diverse which was represented by blue arrows, affecting me and my community because people of color may feel more comfortable living in areas like the Main Line as diversity increase.",

What do you notice?\nI noticed that there are a lot of blue arrows all across the United States which indicates that the amount of people of color has increased over the years.

I also wonder why there are more arrows towards the east side of the country and not the west side. I also wonder how this will change in the future and if it will increase or decrease dramatically. \n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis impacts me and my community because since I am from the United States, I can see how Massachusetts has changed. As well as this, since the share of people of color increased over the years, I wonder how this will affect demographics of my state. \n4. What's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\nIn this graph, we see a map of the United States with different colored arrows which indicates the share of people of color or the share of white population increased.

I notice that longer arrows indicate larger growth. The largest white population increase is around the South Carolina and Georgia shared border and also around southwestern Texas. The largest POC population increase is around Northern Georgia and Kentucky. The arrows are closer together on the east coast, where the general population is greater. \nI wonder if border control has anything to do with the increase of white people in Texas. I also wonder why the POC population is increasing in the eastern half of the US, and not as much in the western half. If all of the arrows indicate growth, where has there been population decreases?\nThis relates to my community because I live in a majority white area where diversity is increasing a lot, especially around Philadelphia.\nCaption: POC population increased nearly everywhere; Is this harmful overpopulation or beneficial diversity?",

I notice that the areas with the most increase in white population is in the south east in Georgia and South Carolina. I also find it interesting that there is a dense amount of people of color increasing in cities such as New York and Philadelphia. \nI wonder what causes the number of people of color to increase. Is the white population also decreasing? Or is it staying the same? I wonder how the increase in people of color is affecting other things in the counties? I wonder if the higher rates in diversity help appeal to more immigrants, and therefore increase the diversity even further. \nThis connects to my community because I am a person of color who notices diversity. The area in which I live is predominantly white and seeing high rates of diversity interests me because it means change is occurring. My parents are also immigrants and something that did not appeal to them about moving to where they live now was the low number of people of color. The high rates in diversity can help people of color feel more accepted in historically white areas. \nAmerica Really Has Become a Melting Pot: Increasing Numbers of Diversity Across the Country.",
