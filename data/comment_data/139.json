Additionally, generally, fewer Americans believe that the president should do more to address global warming compared to congress, and putting the blame on their governor appears to be the middle ground between the other two options. I wonder why the data turned out to be this way. At first, I wondered why people were not putting more responsibility on the President, the person who is supposed to have all the influence. Upon further consideration, putting the responsibility on congress does make sense, as they ultimately have the most power, and if united for a particular cause (global warming), then they could get the most done to address climate change. I notice that throughout all three of the visuals, North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming appear blue, meaning that at most, only 40-45% of the state\u2019s population felt that their elected leaders should do more to address global warming. I wonder why these three states appear to be outliers; what separates them from the other 47 states? I wonder if the people that responded to the survey and had their opinions recorded are a good reflection of the rest of their respective state\u2019s population. I wonder this because of the mention that the most recent update to the maps was based on a survey of around 1,000 Americans worldwide.

This intrigues me as I wonder where Americans stand in today's world on their trust in the government. Typically, the person in power of a country, such as a president or prime minister, seems to be the common scapegoat in times of dismay. For example, Boris Johnson was blamed for the excessive outbreak of COVID-19 in the UK during the pandemic. However, recognising that the majority of the states had bluer shades (meaning less people agreed) when asking more of the president leads me believe that Americans believe more in the faults of congruent power.",

This is very interesting to me because I think if you asked a random person on the street they couldn't tell you the difference between what congress does compared to what the president does. I think the reason behind why this is that the president can say he is going to do something and just not do it. You see this all the time during elections where politicians promise you the world to get more votes and then rarely follow through with anything they said. This is not the case for congress as they just pass bills and give away money. So people can actually see what is being done.",

ON the flip side of things, I observe that American's believe that the president should do the least, and thus be the least involved when it comes to issues regarding climate change. This was interesting, as I wonder why people shed the blame to congress at large rather than transitioning the blame to one singular individual. Human psychology suggests that when being hypercritical about generalized issues, people tend to shed the blame on one singular person representative of a larger social body. For instance, I am sure we have all heard \"unemployment levels are high, it is person X's fault\". Obviously said person is not sitting in their office, pressing buttons and making arrangements to increase the rate of unemployment, but serves a greater and more pertinent symbolic effect that America tends to elucidate. I am further curious to discover the reasons as to why so many American's feel like congress is at fault and should do more.",

The choices are very different, more states want congress to do more, less states think the president should do more. The states on the outside of America are mostly in the 50-65% the states in the middle of America are mostly in the 40-50%\nI wonder why the states decided who should do more to address global warming.

What is the reason the states don't think the president doesn't have to do more? What main difference can congress make that most states want it to do more to address global warming?\nThe data is asking how much global warming affects the community.

The number of people who believe the government should take more action to address the problem is significant, but it pales in comparison to what Congress could do. I also observe that a lot of individuals believe the president shouldn't take additional climate change action beyond what they have already taken. Additionally, it demonstrates that there are more states where less than 50% of residents think the president should take action to combat climate change. This may indicate that people don't anticipate the president to take action against global warming and don't think Congress or the executive branch should.\n\n2. \nI wonder whether people's perception that Congress and the government should take more action to combat climate change than the president is because they think the latter is too busy \"running the country\" to be addressing things that people overlook ?\n\n\n3.\nThis concerns me and my community because it's crucial to know who will be talking about significant problems like climate change, which has impacted our environment and planet, and if we don't take action, it will continue to have detrimental effects on it.\n\n4. \nThis graph displays the nations\u00a0view on\u00a0who needs to take additional action to tackle climate change.\n\nWho should be our elected leader to manage the crucial climate change discussion?",

You mention Congress and the President and you speculate (based on your correct interpretations of the maps) that there are more Americans that want the Legislative (more so than the Executive) branch to do something about climate change.  \n\nI wonder if you can go further and speculate as to WHY we seem to task Congress with more responsibility on this issue. \n\nBe sure return to this site on Friday when we will reveal the free link to the article that includes these maps, additional information and a few Stat Nuggets.",

Yet the president seems to get the least amount of criticism about doing more about climate change.  Do you think that is because we don't want the president to make changes?  Or because the population already thinks he's done enough.\n\nIn actuality two of the three maps refer to the national government.

I also notice that in light of the high percentile of agreement, many Americans are very split on the issue or tend to stay neutral, meaning that they agreed to disagree since the percentage was almost cut in half. Only a fraction of the states had an extreme agreement or a low percentage of agreement. \n\n2. I wonder why the percentage of people in the nation relies more on the governor doing something about climate change rather than the actual president? Also, why do people tend to vote for one extreme over another extreme, and not really focus on the person that can make the final decision, which is the president?\n\n3. This can relate to the nation as a whole because climate change has changed the way we live our lives and the constant fear the people live in every day that a storm or the heat will destroy their town or state. It should be up to the people to decide what's best for the country because they live through it every day.\n\n4. What's going on in this graph is the percentage of the nation from elected officials who should do more on climate change. It is the people's votes being presented on this graph. The headline of this graph should be, \"Elected Officials Under Pressure: Who Shall   Charge For Climate Change?\"",

You have provided an interesting post here. \n\nOne thing you wonder is, \"... why the percentage of people in the nation relies more on the governor doing something about climate change rather than the actual president?\"\n\nIn looking at what these images truly measure, I want to take you to our state of NJ. I'm sure know that the environment is a big issue in NJ (see our high percentages for wanting congress and the president to do more).  Yet when we look at the map regarding the governor, it doesn't seem to match.  Why is that? It isn't that Governor Murphy has done nothing for the environment (see recent grocery store plastic bag ban...and reactions to it).  \n\nSo what's it about.  Do we in NJ care less about the environment, or do we have specific feelings about what the state government already does?  I'd be curious about your thoughts..",

The main thing that sticks out to me is that a majority of people believe congress should be doing more.  Another thing that stands out is how people feel their governors should be doing more in comparison to the president.  This is probably due to the fact that climate change has different effects on different states and congress and the governors could do more.  I wonder how politics and political parties relate to these statistics.  For example, California and New York, two typically liberal states, consistently believe their officials need to do more.

In the Congress graph, the percentage of Americans who think the Congress should do more to address global warming is relatively high, in most states there is 50% or more in each that think so. In the president graph, the percentage in most states is less than 50% which is quite low, which tells me for the most part americans are satisfied/tolerate the decisions of the president towards global warming. In the governor graph, most of the country thinks the governor should do more, the percentage isn\u2019t so high but it does pass 50%. \n\nWhat do you wonder? I wonder why the percentage of Americans who think the president should do more to address global warming is lower than expected considering the president has more power as head of the largest branch of government. \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?

    "comment info": "1. I notice that the most commonly observed opinion in the graph is that congress should do more to address global warming. Slightly fewer people believe that their governor should do more, and way fewer believe that the president should do more. A few states in the north consistently show that they're not as worried about global warming compared to other states.\n\n2. I wonder how region, political party, and the times over which these data were collected affected the data. Political ideologies vary by state and have changed over time. Additionally, climate change has been much more observable lately than in 2008. It's possible that if the data were separated into 4-year timelines adjacent to presidential terms rather than a collection over 13 years, the graphs could have a completely different meaning. Also, the data shows the overall opinion in each state, but what if the graph showed the data they collected in a way that would show the different regions where people had different opinions, rather than just state borders?\n\n3. This relates to my community in many ways. One of them is my generation. The current generation mostly believes in the negative effects of global warming. Another way is the region/state in which I live, NJ. Most people in my immediate vicinity agree that Murphy does do a decent job concerning the environment, and doesn't completely ignore it like governors in other states.\n\n4.

(the president can pass the bills proposed, but Congress has to put together the bills and pass them.) \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nLiving in New Jersey, the coast is directly affected by climate change. During hurricane season, New Jersey often experiences flooding and a lot of rain. If nothing is done about the climate, parts of New Jersey will likely be underwater, as the sea levels are rising. \n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?

The category of the graph changes its color and changes depending on Americans' opinion of the President, the Congress, and the state governor. I wonder why on the graph West Virginia stays in the blue which means they think that the 3 categories in their state are all blue because their economy relies on coal which contributes to global warming. This relates to and affects my community because it gives me an idea of where my state lies on the issue of global warming. This also affects my life because of the policy-making that could be about transportation. The reason why the colors are the way they are is because of the population of each state. Most of the blue states have a small population, but also the color depends on the political office holding the most power. The west coast and east coast states where most of the U.S population is are more towards warm colors. A majority of the U.S thinks that Congress and governors are doing a bad of addressing global warming. This is because Congress has a big part in the changing of law process which directly affects the global warming issue. This is similar to the effect of governors on a state scale they have some power to change the laws which is why most people believe that those too need to do more about the issue.

This is probably due to the president only being able to enforce laws, and the fact that congress can make climate policies to slow the effect of climate change. Local and state governors also have more power, as they can make laws more specific to how much pollution they are outputting. The graph does have a few inconsistencies, much like all data, like Wyoming, North Dakota, and West Virginia thinking that congress should do less, but this is probably due to their populations mostly being people who think that climate change isn't an issue, climate change not affecting them as much, or no one living there to interview in the first place. This will probably affect how policy makers choose how they vote and what laws they will try to pass, as higher percentage of people who think that something should be done will persuade them into making more decisions addressing climate change. These policies could make the climate more stable, and as such, will result in better temperatures for everywhere, and preservation of natural environments around the county.

    "comment info": "In the three maps of America, we can see Americans' thoughts about who should be taking action against climate change. In the first map, we can see that the opinion for congress to take action is extremely popular among most states. It is even more significant when comparing how popular the opinion is between the other two maps. The majority of people believe that Congress should be responsible for taking action against climate change. something that I wonder about is how the question was asked. Was it asked in an open-ended way? Was it asked in three different questions (Should congress take action? should the president take action? etc.) Or was it more of an opinionated simple question? Depending on how the question is asked, it is possible that the poll results could be skewed. This relates to my community because I can see what my fellow citizens of my state believe and how it differs. I can see that my state (Colorado) is passionate about congress taking action against climate change. \nPossible Headline: \"Who Your State Believes Should be the Primary Force Against Climate Change\"",

To be specific the states around the coast are in the 60-65% on the congress doing more. I wonder if they feel that way because they are feeling more of the impacts because of their location. This relates to me personally by seeing to changes in the seasons over time. For example Colorado hasn't truly had snow and true cold whether in the winter for years now. This is a effect of the global warming issue. These graphs are comparing the US's opinions on what specific part of government should address this issue and based on the results we can infer that American want congress to address it.

I think that it's less of a divide on whether they should divide or not but more about the left and right fighting over their opinions on it. With the midterm elections coming I think it could be a huge factor on why people are thinking this way. Maybe after it is over we could see the change in people opinions. But besides the presidential election, it seems like the general public wants climate change to be addressed which should be addressed no matter what side you are on!",

    "comment info": "Based on the graph, it is evident that congress needs to do the most when addressing global warming. The graph suggest that a wide majority of the United States wants congress to do more on the oval warming issue. Citizens residing in California, New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey want Congress to do more to address global warming. However, North Dakota, Wyoming and West Virginia are less passionate about this issue. The midwestern states seemed to not feel as strongly to have the president do more about global warming. Once again, Wyoming, North Dakota, and West Virginia felt the most passionate that the president shouldn\u2019t do as much for global warming. Based on the third graph, it is still a majority that the people of the U.S. want the governor to address global warming, with exception to North Dakota, Wyoming, West Virginia, Montana, and Alaska. One thing that I wonder is why Wyoming, North Dakota, and West Virginia are consistent in having less people vote that their elected leaders should do more about addressing global warming. Additionally I also wonder why the midwestern states feel less than the coastal states that the president should advocate global warming. This affects my community and I because it shows where our beliefs stand and how we would want our elected leaders to advocate for them. This graph displays the needs from each state and how Americans want their elected leaders to take action. \nTitle: Who\u2019s Really Doing Enough for Global Warming",

It addresses global warming. It\u2019s obvious people want to help climate change but don\u2019t know where to begin with where or who. What I wonder about the data is how many people took the data. On what platform did the survey take place? How were the questions phrased to propose the matter? I do believe it relates to my community because we are very diverse and concerned for those who don't live with us. Not only the concerns, but the fact that weather is also changing around us. Most came to Vallejo for the gloomy bay area weather with nice sunny days, lately we\u2019ve been going through heat waves and it's not fun. What is going on in the graph are people in America and their opinions on how to aid global warming. Some want the President to take action towards stopping climate change. Others want their state governors to address solutions. And the rest want congress to do something about climate change. To capture the main idea: Which branch is going to make the change?!",

Within this time period, great policy changes, events, leadership position changes, and disaster have greatly affected the trust of government officials.\nFrom the graph, in California the citizens are shown to believe that the governor and president should put forth an equal amount of effort when it comes down to confronting climate change. However, a majority of the state believes that congress should take the most amount of action on dealing with climate change. With the amount of representatives, the citizens of the state most likely have close relations with their representative and feel confident in them making fair decisions.\nIn the following graph, data from surveys conducted across a given time period on the topic of which government officials should take charge of climate change are displayed across a map of the United States with each state having their opinions ranked on a scale displayed from zero percent to one hundred percent.

Other things to note is that three states, North Dakota, Wyoming, and West Virginia, don\u2019t think any officials should address global warming. Also the graphs also show that the states would prefer congress to do something over the president or their governors.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\n     From this graph, I wonder what makes the states say that they don\u2019t want anyone to address global warming as it is a rising issue. With scientific proof that global warming will cause a huge issue down the road, it makes me think on why some states would be against people addressing this issue on getting it reduced or fixed.\n\nHow does this graph relate to you and your community?\n     This graph relates to me and my community by showing what the people around me think of the problem at hand. Since the state I live in currently is California, it\u2019s nice to see that a majority of people would like it if any of the officials would address global warming. \n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?\n     Opinions On Global Warming?

Something else I noticed was how Alaska changed, a majority believes that the congress should do more and for the president and governor the percentage of people that think they should do more goes down.\n2.

I'm wondering why there\u2019s such a high percentage? \n3. This relates to me and my community because global warming can be a community issue. Each person in my community can do more to address global warming. However, I believe that the congress and the governor should do more to bring awareness or have a plan for each community, including mine. I feel like the president only has so much power and can do so much, it really relies on congress to do something.\n4.

Another way this affects our community is because we are one nation which is The United States of America.

In this graph it is showing the US and the percentage between 40-65% of states that answer if congress(1),president(2), or governor(3) should do more to address global warming.

Wouldnt the president have more authority than a governor?\n\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\n\nIt has an impact on global warming and who feels obligated to help out with it.

I am from the state of Florida, and you are from California -- both of our states are directly facing the consequences of policy failures on all levels to address climate change, from droughts to rising sea levels. Might inland states be less concerned about climate change because the issue isn't as likely to affect them personally than it would be on coastal states?",
