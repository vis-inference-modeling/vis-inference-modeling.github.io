Jackson's \u201cThriller\u201d went platinum 34 times, while Swifts album with the most times platinum is \u201cFearless,\u201d with 10 times.  Jackson's first four albums never went platinum, and five of Swift's albums are not counted due to their recent releases, or re-recorded nature that does not allow them to be counted in this way. Both artists have five albums that have crossed the threshold of five times platinum. \n\n**What Do I Wonder?**\nI wonder what the differences in how music is released these days affects these numbers, and in what way. Jackson's music was not released in a time of streaming services, and Swift's was. Swift sels physical music, but that was the main form of sales and streams in Jackson's days. I wonder what this graph would look like if both of these Pop icons were releasing music at the same time. \n\n**How Does This Relate to Me and My Community?**\nIn their own ways, both of these artists help define their generation of music. Being someone who is interested in the present music industry, and would say Taylor Swift is one of the most impactful artists currently, it is interesting to see the comparison of just how huge Michael Jackson's albums were/are and the drastic impact he has had.\n\n**Catchy Headline for the Graph**\nPlatinum Success of Albums for Two Pop Icons",

Notably, most of Jackson's albums achieved platinum status more frequently than Swift's. This suggests that, despite the lower quantity, the impact of his albums is greater in terms of platinum achievements. However, with Swift's new albums not yet reviewed, it's possible that her total platinum awards could surpass Jackson's.\n\nWhat do you wonder? \nIt would be interesting to compare their platinum awards over a specific time, say a decade. Jackson's era lacked digital streaming, meaning his platinum sales were solely reliant on physical album sales. In contrast, artists today benefit from streaming services making it easier to achieve +1M sales. This raises important questions about how shifts in music engagement can influence artists\u2019 platinum achievements.\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis illustrates how music industry success is quantified over time. Both Jackson and Swift are iconic artists, yet their journeys to platinum success differ significantly due to technological shifts; the shift from physical album sales to digital streaming has streamlined the path to achieving platinum status, allowing artists today to reach significant platinum levels more easily than in the past.\n\nHow Technology Influences Platinum Success for Michael Jackson and Taylor Swift",

Thriller, his most popular album, has been certified 34 times platinum, solidifying its position as one of the most successful albums ever. Taylor Swift currently has 50 platinum certifications from 11 original albums but is projected to soon have about 90 platinum certifications. \n\nWhat Do I Wonder?\nHow have these figures changed as a result of the transition from CDs and vinyl to digital streaming? Does Swift have an advantage because digital music is easier and more accessible for people to stream? Would Michael Jackson have more platinum certifications if streaming had existed in his era? \n\nHow Does This Relate to Me and My Community?\nThe music industry is constantly evolving and this comparison shows how streaming has transformed the way an artist's success is measured. Living and going to school in a city like New York, where the entertainment industry is a huge part of the culture, understanding these trends can help explain why artists market their music differently now.

How has the album sold over time to accumulate so many sales? Did majority of the sales occur the time of release or has the album consistently sold well? Why haven't Taylor's later albums sold as well as her earlier albums? Is its related to the change in the way we consume music with streaming? Is it the quality of the music? Is it over saturation? What about the preferences of listeners? \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to my community in the sense that I am a part of the generation that has lived to consume both Taylor and Michael Jackson.

Personally, I enjoy Michael Jackson's music more than Taylor Swift's, and this seems to be the general concept for most. Michael Jackson's most successful album is more than three times larger than Taylor Swift's. Even MJ's second most successful album still has more platinum certifications than Taylor Swifts \"Fearless.\" MJ, being older than Taylor Swift, is much more influential to the current generation of music. MJ may have even influenced Taylor Swift significantly. Although MJ's first four albums did not go platinum, his album \"Thriller\" makes up for it by going platinum 34 times and becoming one of the best albums of all time.",

What I do wonder is that without rereleases how much less would Talor have and how much would MJ have if he was still here and made just a few more albums because he's been gone for a long time. Also, that even though MJ has less nominations than her he still has just 1 less grammy. (Or the problems with the Grammies as a whole) Honestly this doesn't relate much to me and my community/family as even though we definitely listen to MJ I myself haven't heard a SINGLE song of Taylor's since bad blood or sledgehammer when I was a child. Finaly, as I do believe MJ to still be more popular due to the graph and that you don't hear people saying they don't like MJ while there are extremes of people either loving or hating Tayor  a headline I'd give to the graph would be... \n\n\"MJ Slams!

It seems that her fanbase is not just vast but deeply engaged, as her albums continue to generate huge amounts of streams and sales. In contrast, Michael Jackson's peak was more spread out over time, with hits like Thriller in the '80s that defined an entire era.\n-  I wonder how much streaming platforms and social media influence today\u2019s music scene. Taylor Swift\u2019s success seems to be amplified by platforms like Spotify, TikTok, and Instagram, which allow her to maintain a constant presence and interaction with fans. In comparison, Michael Jackson didn\u2019t have access to these tools, so I\u2019m curious how his career might have been different had he been able to use modern social media for promotion and fan interaction.\n- In my community, Taylor Swift has a massive presence\u2014her albums are the soundtrack to many people's lives, especially among younger generations. Her music often brings people together at school events, parties, and in social media conversations. Michael Jackson's influence is still present too, especially with iconic songs that are part of the cultural fabric, but Taylor Swift feels more immediate to my peers. \n-  A headline to capture the graph\u2019s idea is Swift vs. Jackson: A \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cFearless\u201d Race to be at the Top of Pop Royalty.",

Thriller by Michael Jackson took a few years to reach platinum status\u00a0and is the number one song with 34 platinum certifications. Taylor Swift, on the other hand, experienced instant popularity after her debut album went platinum, and up until a recent decline, her albums usually had high certifications. This graph raises questions to me\u00a0about how Taylor Swift's certifications\u00a0would be\u00a0if her new albums that she recorded again were included and if they were as popular as the originals.\u00a0Both Taylor Swift\u00a0and Micheal\u00a0Jackson are very\u00a0well known in my community by all ages\u00a0and it's interesting to see the effects they have side by side on the graph.\nMy headline is\u00a0\"Thriller vs. Taylor: Platinum certifications\"",

It shocks me how big of a gap there is between Micheal Jackson and Taylor Swift, especially with her recent burst in popularity. Another statistic that shocks me is how Taylor Swift is losing sales of albums even after gaining popularity. The giant gap and loss of sales are explainable though since the number of people using album records in the 20th century has diminished. Micheal Jackson is a dead artist and is titled the \u201cKing of Pop\u201d which explains his overwhelming popularity.",

Bringing back countless childhood memories. However, I have genuinely more memories of the Thriller album than Swift's Fearless. I suppose that's due to the graph's visualization of both Jackson and Swift's sales variability per each of their albums. With only some being \"Platinum\" or otherwise incredibly successful. Michael Jackson's Thriller reached 34 million in sales, explaining why I've heard it so many more times!",

In contrast Taylor Swift won platinums from the first album displayed in the chart, and only began to not win or see a decrease in number of platinums after being very successful. Some questions the graph posed for me, were why Micheal Jackson\u2019s \u2018Thriller\u2019 is in blue, while two of Taylor Swift\u2019s albums appear in color, when they only won platinum 9 and 10 times, and Micheal Jackson has another album that has won more than 10 times. This graph can be related to my life and community since these are two very influential figures in todays society and it is interesting to evaluate the number of platinums in a graphical array. I would summarize this graph as \u201c\u2019Taylor versus Micheal\u2019: a graphical display demonstrating the differences in Platinum certifications between Taylor Swift and Michael Jackson.\u201d",

I think it has to do with things that are opinion based.\n\nRelatability: Michael Jackson\u2019s music (in my opinion) caters to a wider audience with his songs that are nostalgic to some people that grew up in the 80s, or with his songs about injustice in the world such as \u2018Scream\u2019 and \u2018Earth Song.\u2019 Taylor on the other hand has a more female and younger fanbase, and yes, it\u2019s a very big one, but her music is catered towards that audience. \n\nThe Fanbases: Earlier I mentioned how Michael Jacksons fans are probably a lot older, and Taylors is younger and more female oriented. Another issue is how the fans react. I rarely ever see any MJ fans on TikTok, Twitter or even Instagram, but when it comes to Taylor, I only ever see negative things about either her (that non-fans say) or the insane things that the very odd Taylor fans say when people don\u2019t like her. People say her fanbase is more \u2018cult\u2019 like due to the mass amounts of people at concerts and their behavior, but with MJ people just prefer to enjoy the music.\n\nAt the end of the day, comparing music artists that are successful is I feel like something that doesn\u2019t need to be such a big problem that people make it out to be. You like what you like, a lot of stuff is opinion based, and music is subjective and means something different to everyone.",

I also noticed that the bar graph for Micheal Jackson\u2019s best-selling album, Thriller overwhelmingly exceeded the bar graph for Taylor Swift\u2019s album, Fearless. I wonder if Taylor Swift can still be more popular than Micheal Jackson even though his album went platinum 34 times while Taylor Swift\u2019s album went platinum 10 times.

On the other hand, Taylor Swift appeals more to the younger generations causing her to be more popular among young adults, teens, and children. Since Taylor Swift is still actively releasing music, she can experiment with new genres and appeal to more people of different age groups. This can increase the number of albums she sells and could one day, surpass Jackson\u2019s 34 platinum record.

Some people view her responses to these conflicts as dramatic or overly sensationalized, which can turn fans and observers against her.\n\nInitially, Swift was criticized for her perceived silence on political issues. Although she has become more vocal recently, some feel that her late involvement is disingenuous or should have come sooner.\n\nCritics sometimes argue that her carefully curated image and the marketing of her personal life can come off as manipulative or inauthentic, leading to disillusionment among fans.\n\n Some people feel that Swift often portrays herself in a victim light, which can rub others the wrong way, especially when it comes to her breakups and public disputes.\n\nThese points reflect some opinions held by critics, and it's essential to remember that views about public figures can vary widely.

Some believe her songs lack depth for a few reasons.\n\n 1. Similar Songwriting\n\nCritics say Swift's songs often follow the same pattern, focusing on love and heartbreak. This repetition can make her music predictable and less exciting.\n\n 2. Focus on Sales\n\nSome think her commercial success prioritizes profits over art. The music industry pressures artists to create hits, which can reduce the emotional depth of her songs.\n\n#### 3. Lyric Simplicity\n\nWhile many fans like her storytelling, some find her lyrics too simple. Critics argue that she uses clich\u00e9s, making her songs feel more like diary entries than deep emotional explorations.\n\n#### 4. **Shift to Pop*\n\nSwift transitioned from country to pop music, and some fans miss the authenticity of her earlier work. This shift can make it harder for certain listeners to connect with her new songs.\n\n#### 5. **Too Much Exposure**\n\nWith social media and streaming, some feel overwhelmed by her constant releases. This overexposure can lead to listener fatigue, making it harder to engage with her music.\n\n\n\nThough Taylor Swift has many fans and is influential in the music industry, there are valid critiques about her music's depth. Factors like similar songwriting, a focus on sales, simple lyrics, her shift to pop, and overexposure contribute to the belief that her music may not resonate with everyone.",

When Michael Jackson ran the pop industry, streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music didn\u2019t exist. YouTube was not widely used to listen to music, prompting radio networks and physical albums to be the primary source of music entertainment. Another indicator of this is how while Michael Jackson has better Album sales, Taylor has significantly more streams and in-person concert viewers. While these are both affected by their time, we can tell that they have relatively similar musical success based on their Grammy count, 13 and 14 respectively. This proves that album sales in the form of Platinum Times aren\u2019t a worthy indicator of an album\u2019s success.\nThis relates to me and my community, as music is a soulful entertainment, and art that brings people together. Using it to teach us about improperly represented conclusions based on outdated or irrelevant data is so inspiring.\n\u201cTaylor might run the music industry now, but the king of pop will always be platinum.\u201d",

I noticed that this graph compares two of the world's biggest pop stars, the late Micheal Jackson and Taylor Swift, based on the number of platinum certifications they have accumulated throughout their career. Micheal Jackson has an overwhelming lead, with his top album, \"Thriller,\" earning  24 more platinum certifications than Swift's top album, \"Fearless.\" It is important to note that the certifications for Swift's rereleased albums are not up-to-date, and, therefore, this graph is not entirely accurate. It is interesting how Jackson's first four albums did not receive nearly as much attention as his later ones. Taylor Swift has released more albums than Micheal Jackson, yet none have achieved the same amount of fame as \"Thriller.\"\n2. I wonder if the stark difference between Thriller and Fearless is due to Thriller being out for a longer. I wonder if this gap will close as time goes by. Would Taylor's rerecorded albums come closer to the certifications of Thriller if they were up-to-date? \n3. This is relevant to me because Micheal Jackson and Taylor Swift are two artists that I love and have made major waves in the music industry. Their music has shifted the popular culture, forever changing music trends. I have witnessed many claims that Taylor is the new \"Queen of Pop\" replacing Micheal Jackson, but I think this graph proves them wrong.\n4.

For taylor swift to make an album that surpasses michael jackson's thriller album may be unlikely due to her audience, as it consists of mostly young adults, kids, and adults, however, if she pays attention to the trends in her sales and audience, it is concieveable that she may be able to harness her creativity to appeal to a wider range of music-taste.",

This is in contrast to Taylor Swift, who earned more than 5 platinum on her debut album. I think this might show that Taylor Swift had more talent than Michael Jackson but Michael Jackson was able to develop his talent better to produce Thriller, one of the best-selling albums of all time. On top of this, the last few albums produced by Taylor Swift didn\u2019t earn any Platinums. \n\n2) I wonder if this might show that Taylor Swift had more talent than Michael Jackson but Michael Jackson was able to develop his talent better to produce Thriller, one of the best-selling albums of all time. \n\nAdditionally, I wonder if Taylor Swift has passed her musical peak. because her past three albums have earned 0 platinum total and her peak album was almost 16 years ago with the album \u201cFearless\u201d.

And the song \"thriller\" has also become an iconic halloween song, and i'm sure it gets played more than every during the halloween season. It remind's me of Mariah Carey's \"All I wont for Christmas\".  And I also think Jackson and Swift were chosen for this because Jackson is known as the \"King of Pop,\" but now Swift has become so popular in this generation. Even if you are not a fan of her music, her name as become a household name everyone knows. I honestly also think that there aren't many people who don't know at least one of her songs. So I feel like this graph wanted to challenge wether he was still the king of pop, due to the rising success and popularity of Swift in this generation. I don't think this is necessarily an accurate way to show that, but I think showing how many times Jacksons album went platinum shows how his name and legacy of the \"King of Pop\" will be hard to take away.",

    "comment info": "In this graph, they are showing the albums released by both Taylor Swift and Michael Jackson and showing how many times those albums have gone platinum. I noticed that Thriller reached 34 platinum certifications. However, none of his other albums are even close to that number. I also noticed that, on the contrary, all of Taylor Swift's albums are relatively close together. I wonder two main things. First, is it better to have one big album and a bunch of others that did well, OR is it better to have a bunch of albums that all performed well and not one huge one? I'm also curious about what made the album Thriller so popular. This is extremely relevant to me as I have been a huge fan of both performers since I was little, so it is extremely interesting to see them being compared. It is also relevant because the success of Taylor Swift has been a huge discussion in the media today, so it is even more interesting to see her put against such a monumental music figure like Michael Jackson. \n\nTitle: Climbing To The Top: Taylor Swift and Michael Jackson's Platinum Certifications",

I also notice that the majority of other Michael Jackson albums also have more platinum certification than the majority of Taylor Swifts. I also notice that platinum albums are defined as albums that have sold 1,000,000 copies. It also mentions Taylor Swift's recent sales data was not included in this demographic. I wonder if these things could have skewed the results. Although it does say a certain amount of online streaming of songs does count as a copy sold, that doesn't seem to be an accurate, definite way to measure compared to a copy being sold. Looking at Taylor Swift's popularity, this graph may be trying to show this isn't an accurate way to measure popularity. Although Michael Jackson has more albums sold, especially in the modern generation, there is no doubt Taylor Swift is \"bigger.\u201d. Her popularity is shown through more modern ways like Instagram and TikTok following. This relates to me and my community because Taylor is a very big part of my community. There are very few people in my generation that would be able to name specific Michael Jackson songs or names of his albums. Though almost everyone in my generation, even people who don't listen to Taylor Swift, are able to name some of her songs and albums. Almost everyone loves and listens to her.",

I think part of the reason thrillers were so popular is because of the cultural shift going on in the early 1980s. There was a blend of different cultures of music going on. Jackson was able to blend these different types of music into his songs and album \"Thriller\".  Also, the early 1980s is when technology heavily advanced. Jackson's musical video utilized new technology and was very appealing to Americans because they never had seen anything like it before.",

However, Micheal Jackson's \"Thriller\" has more than 3 times the amount of platinum records than Taylor Swift's \"Fearless.\" Also, Jackson's first four albums did not go platinum at all. One thing I wonder is if Taylor Swift's album, which has not been certified yet, could pass \"Thriller.\" Another question I have is why \"Thriller\" is so much more popular compared to Jackson's other albums and Taylor Swift's albums.

Taylor Swift has more albums that aren't platinum yet, but a lot of them are newer so they haven't had as much time. I wonder if Taylor Swift will surpass Michael Jackson as her albums are out for longer.

Michael Jackson has a large number of platinum certifications on his album \u201cThriller\u201d (being platinum 34 times). This is a much larger number compared to Taylor Swift, whose highest number of platinum certifications is 10. This shows that Michael Jackson's album is very successful and popular. I wonder what made Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" album, so popular, compared to his other albums which weren't as successful (did not receive as many platinum certifications).

I notice that Michael Jackson's iconic album Thriller stands out with a record 34 platinum certifications, which is extraordinary and places it among the highest-certified albums of all time. Taylor Swift, while still accumulating platinum certifications, has seen impressive success, especially with her album Fearless reaching 10 platinum certifications. This shows that Taylor Swift is rapidly becoming a major figure in the music industry, though Michael Jackson still holds a more substantial historical record. I wonder how Swift's certifications will evolve over time, especially given the rise of streaming, which could further boost her numbers. With Taylor Swift\u2019s albums benefiting from streaming data, this makes me wonder whether Thriller would have reached the same level of success if streaming had been as dominant during Michael Jackson\u2019s time. This comparison relates to my community, as both artists are influential figures in pop culture, with Swift being particularly popular among my age generation. \nA catchy headline: \"Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller Still Reigns, but Taylor Swift is Fast Becoming a Platinum Powerhouse.\"",

Michael Jackson is said to be the greatest pop artist of all time, while Taylor Swift is said to be the greatest pop artist of the current music industry.  I noticed that Swift's most sold album, \"Fearless,\" only reached 10 platinum certifications, compared to Jackson's outstanding 34 platinum certifications.  Michael Jackson's album has been platinum certified three times as much as Swift's most popular album, \"Fearless.\"  While a vast majority of the younger generations will argue that Taylor Swift is the greatest pop musician of all time, it is clear that Michael Jackson has dominated the pop industry solely based on his \"Thriller\" album.  I also notice that Swift's \"Taylor's Version\" albums have not yet been certified, and Jackson's first four albums are not platinum.  I wonder if Taylor Swift's existing albums will ever come close to Jackson's \"Thriller,\" or if she will release an album in the future that will send the album's platinum certifications soaring.  While it would be extremely difficult to beat this achievement or even come close, it will be interesting to see if Swift's albums ever reach a level close to that of Michael Jackson's \"Thriller.\"  This relates to me and my community because I am a fan of Taylor Swift and because of how popular she is in the music industry at this time.\nHeadline: Michael Jackson vs. Taylor Swift: Platinum Popularity",

I also notice that Micheal Jackson has gotten 30 Platinum certifications on this, while Fearless only has nearly 10. I also notice that Micheal Jackson's first four albums are not platinum, while Taylor Swift's first 9 were platinum. I wonder if any of Taylor Swifts albums in the future will exceed Micheal Jackson's album thriller in platinum certifications? I also wonder how many listens that Micheal Jackson's album still gets daily? I wonder if Taylor Swift's new album \"The Tortured Poets Department\" is growing as great as the album Thriller since it's becoming very popular. I think that in the graph, there is a comparison between Micheal Jackson's albums and Taylor Swift's albums and how many platinum certifications that it received, if any at all. I also think that in the graph, they are drastically showing the greatest hit album of both artists and emphasizing that Micheal Jackson's album is still so much more popular off of platinum certifications of 30, that it would be very hard to overcome this number. This relates to me and my community because of the attention that Taylor Swift is receiving, and how popular she is.

I also wonder why people like Jackson\u2019s Music more than Swift\u2019s. This may be because Swift has gone through other genres, such as country, while Jackson was mostly pop.

However, Michael Jackson\u2019s other albums (excluding \u201cThriller\u201d) have seen roughly the same success as Taylor Swift\u2019s albums, despite being released decades earlier.  \n\nConsidering that Michael Jackson\u2019s albums were released decades before Taylor Swift\u2019s, I wonder how many platinum awards he was able to accumulate in the same time frame as Taylor Swift. I would also like to know how well Michael Jackson and Taylor Swift would fare in each other\u2019s time periods.",

It appears to triple his previous album, and his following album goes back down into where I'd assume it to be.  I also notice that is states that Taylor Swift's platinum certifications are not up to date, but even then, I believe they won't amount to Jackson's level of notoriety.\n\nI wonder why Thriller did as well as it did.  I understand how enjoyable it is to listen to, as Thriller is an incredible song.  My only assumption would be that because it is used on the holidays (and frequently played on repeat), it acts as a universally enjoyable song, used by everyone participating in Halloween, whether or not they share the same music tastes as one another outside of the holiday itself.\n\nWhile a song like this doesn't really affect my community in a massive way, I have been to many a Hallow's Eve party and noticed people enjoying their time spent with their closest companions, most of the time with Thriller in the background.  I see Thriller as being a song in which entire communities can find refuge in, and I'd like to think that bonds can be made because of a catchy song playing in the background of a party where one guy is dressed up as Where's Waldo, and another guy is dressed up as a Zombie.\n\n\"Michael Jackson's Thriller Album was Taylor Made for Platinum, while Swift's Rest Lower on the Charts\"",

However, due to Michael\u2019s success with 34 times platinum on Thriller, his overall number of platinums is very similar to Taylor\u2019s. They are also closer now as Taylor Swift has only had one platinum album in her last 6 albums. Michael Jackson also has 10 albums compared to Taylor\u2019s 15. \nWonder: I wonder how current trends and recency bias are affecting the popularity of the two artists\u2019 albums. Michael Jackson started out slow, but gained popularity quickly, whereas Taylor Swift started off strong, but recently has been losing some traction. Taylor\u2019s gradual loss of popularity could be due to a bandwagon effect where she was consistently popular because everyone was listening to her, or it could be because other artists are releasing music and there isn\u2019t enough to go around. I think Michael Jackson\u2019s case was different as he didn\u2019t release as many albums, which makes the listeners more eager for each new album. \nCommunity: This relates to my community and I as Michael Jackson and Taylor Swift are very well known throughout.

After a further inspection, it is seen that Taylor Swift has more total albums with the title of platinum, but the amount of times platinum is less than Michael Jackson\u2019s fewer albums. Another noticeable detail is the fact that while Michael\u2019s first albums were not platinum, Taylor\u2019s latest albums have been the ones not to receive the award.\nIt makes me wonder how the success of an artist can be seen through their platinum albums, and if this directly correlates to the popularity of artists, such as Taylor Swift and Michael Jackson's success. The graph shows the rough numbers of sales, and based on what seems to be trends, I wonder how future fanbases would have received albums that Michael Jackson could have released, and how sales would have performed. \nThis chart helps to explain parts of the music industry, such as how all musicians eventually reach a peak time in their career, although some last longer than others. For my peers and community around me this can help those who want to pursue a career in music and even those who do not, proving the idea of never giving up, as shown with the first few albums of Michael Jackson\u2019s career not being hits, but after much work and commitment, eventually succeeded past what was ever seen before.",

These albums are ordered chronologically from left to right. I notice that Thriller by Micheal Jackson is a clear outlier in this graph, with an astonishingly high number of over 30 Platinum certifications. Additionally, I noticed that the first four of Michael Jackson\u2019s albums did not earn any platinum and then he suddenly released Thriller, and the album before Thriller which both earned more than 5 platinum. This is in contrast to Taylor Swift, who earned more than 5 platinum on her debut album. I think this might show that Taylor Swift had more talent than Michael Jackson but Michael Jackson was able to develop his talent better to produce Thriller, one of the best-selling albums of all time. On top of this, the last few albums produced by Taylor Swift didn\u2019t earn any Platinums. \n\n2) I wonder if this might show that Taylor Swift had more talent than Michael Jackson but Michael Jackson was able to develop his talent better to produce Thriller, one of the best-selling albums of all time. \n\nAdditionally, I wonder if Taylor Swift has passed her musical peak. because her past three albums have earned 0 platinum total and her peak album was almost 16 years ago with the album \u201cFearless\u201d.

Michael Jackson also was producing music in an era when social media wasn't around to help spread it. I wonder why people think Taylor Swift is bigger when Michael Jackson has been dead for 2 decades and still has more platinum's then Taylor Swift.

The album \"Thriller\" (which is Michael Jackson's best selling album) is over 3x more popular than \"Fearless\" (Taylor Swifts best selling album). 1989 the album is almost as popular than Fearless. Taylor Swifts biggest album only has only 10 Platinum certifications. I also know that Michael Jackson has been making music longer than Taylor Swift. I also noticed that Michael Jackson has only made 6 Platinum albums while Taylor Swift has made 10. I also noticed that a lot of Michael Jackson's later albums were Platinum, while Taylor's Platinum albums are on the earlier side. I notice that only 4 of Michael's albums are not Pantinum, while 5 of Taylor's are not certified.\n\n2. What do I wonder? Why do people like Michael Jackson's pop songs better than Taylor Swift's? Maybe because that is the only genre he sang in while Taylor has done, Country, pop, and Indie; because Michael has more practice? \n\n3.

For Taylor Swift she blew up on the fourth album and I wonder if she didn't blow up on the second album and took her six albums for Michael to be popular would she quit or keep going because Taylor Swift grew up with money and a colonial house and dad's money. Michael Jackson wasn't a quitter he grew up poor and his family did music but he had a ambition and goal to be a famous singer. I also wonder what if Michael Jackson was popular in this era because social media wasn't here yet and they blow up Taylor swift on social media and everywhere and it gets sort of annoying especially for me being in school with a bunch of people who listen to Taylor Swift. \n\nHow did this affects my family? I wasn't born when Michael Jackson was around but my parents were a big fan of him and it was probably a big thing and much hype just like Taylor Swift. Michael Jackson also fell of pretty hard but still got platinums for the rest.  Also it affected my parents when he passed away because having your favorite singer pass is fatal.",
