This clashes with the common American belief of them being quite the prestigious country with a leading education system. What\u2019s more, our wide access to technology doesn\u2019t put us above others in terms of successful education, which shows that our motivation for higher education can\u2019t simply be increased with higher quality options. This means that for the U.S to be considered truly one of the leading countries in education, we need to increase motivation for education, by providing more successful post-education opportunities that reward the completion of education of all levels.",

The other graph so how many men and women are getting an education and it turns out that women dominate in both countries and all of them are on the graph, That makes me really proud to know that more women want to get their education than others.

Mobility can also be downward, meaning that the respondent\u2019s highest level of education is below that of the parent with the highest educational attainment. Finally, the status quo means that the respondent has the same level of educational attainment as the parent with the highest educational attainment.\n What do you think of this method of calculating educational mobility comparing a child to the highest educational achievement by a parent\nDescribe the education mobility for children in your country using \nthe United States, the percentage of women with post-high school education is about 25 percent greater than men would you explain this?  Women have to get more education to get a similar job than a man.changes do you think might increase men\u2019s  percentage? The ability to make more money.",

I believe this effects the jobs they get, and the amount of money they get in return for their job. In short, a better education gives you a better job, which then gets you a better income; and the opposite can happen as well.\n\n#2 I believe this way of calculating the educational differences is amazing, it gives a great estimate of if the majority of the population\u2019s education is getting better or worse.\n\n#3 The amount of upwardly mobile just barely beats out downwardly mobile, and the amount for the same education is more than upwardly mobile and downwardly mobile combined. The state of the country isn\u2019t bad or concerning, but it\u2019s not good either. It does make a lot of sense though in the state of the country.\n#4 Maybe less industrial jobs would help, or less physical activities available to them.",

(Control F for \u201cJiyoung\u201d to find the reply.) As a Korean living in the US, she explained why South Korea has such a high level of educational success.  It has to do with Korean history and culture.  Thank you for sharing your perspective.  We hope others will follow his example.\n\nYou can continue to post responses.  Please check back tomorrow --  Thursday afternoon, OCTOBER 3 to see the Reveal with a link to the original New York Times article, some questions about the graphs, and some Stat Nuggets.\n The next graph will be released tomorrow -- THURSDAY, OCTOBER 3, with moderation on WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 9.  You may respond before, during, or after the live moderation by going to \u201c\u201cWhat's Going On In This Graph?\u201d  The topic --  global temperatures.  \n\nAlso, you can view the webinar with teachers and students discussing how to learn from graphs using The New York Times.

South Korea obtained the largest amount of people to go to school after high school. South Korea really seems to be on the rise with their education, considering that the majority of the people are receiving more education than their parents did. The US is surprisingly not as high as I thought it would be, but maybe the statistics have changed since 2012 and 2014. In the dotted graph for the US, more women also seek further education than men do.\n\nI wonder why they used data from 2012. How much has education changed since 2012? Why is the Czech Republic education on the downfall? What leads to a decrease in education in some countries?",

On the right graph, it is clear that the percentage of women in every country are pursuing a higher education than men. Does maturity play a large role in this data? Cost for higher education varies country to country- does this also play a large role? Do people in countries with a low cost higher education have more incentive to go to college? Also, the status quo must vary per family per country. If your parents went to college and you went to college, you received the same level of education. On the other hand, if your parents only completed a limited education (middle school, rather than high school or college) and you got a college education, you are part of the upwardly mobile trend. At some point, if everyone receives a higher education as do their parents, the status quo section will increase until the entire graph is the same or less, rather than a ix of all 3. I think this is why Italy is so high on the left graph, and so low on the right one; students may be doing better than their parents, but not at a level higher than high school.",

Even after their school days, they spend hours at cram schools trying to improve their test scores. This factor could explain the graph on the left because students face an overbearing amount of pressure to make more money than their parents.  That begs the question, how much of a role does money play into young adults pursuing higher education? And what role does the government play in getting more people to pursue higher education? For example, in Denmark, the country pays for students to pursue higher education. This is kind of confusing because why is Denmark lower on the list. It also makes me question, what kind of social pressures are put on students from countries closer to the top of the graph to pursue higher education to their parents?\nFor the graph on the right, it looks like it is exemplifying the shift from men to women pursuing higher education.

In the graph on the right it shows that all countries have more women that got higher education, and a few countries that were really close in men to women percentages. Britain, Austria and Germany were very close in percentages. i feel like that is most likely because education is equal in competition. Men are probably more likely to go to trade schools rather than to seek higher education because it will benefit them earlier in life. women go to seek higher education because it might be more beneficial later in life, though the thoughts and mindsets may be different for every person.\n\nNew Headline: Education standards that are shown by gender in selected genders for ages 25-34",

On the right graph, it is clear that the percentage of women in every country are pursuing a higher education than men. Does maturity play a large role in this data? Cost for higher education varies country to country- does this also play a large role? Do people in countries with a low cost higher education have more incentive to go to college? Also, the status quo must vary per family per country. If your parents went to college and you went to college, you received the same level of education. On the other hand, if your parents only completed a limited education (middle school, rather than high school or college) and you got a college education, you are part of the upwardly mobile trend. At some point, if everyone receives a higher education as do their parents, the status quo section will increase until the entire graph is the same or less, rather than a ix of all 3. I think this is why Italy is so high on the left graph, and so low on the right one; students may be doing better than their parents, but not at a level higher than high school.",

I notice the first bar graph is less specific than the second, dealing with overall education received in different countries, as opposed to education beyond high school in the second graph, which also shows a difference in gender. Out of all the countries, the greatest disparity between child and parent is seen in South Korea, as the children got more education than their parents. The greatest disparity in gender for the second graph is between greatest in Poland, where the two points are spread out the most. The Czech Republic has the smallest difference in the first graph, and Germany has the least disparity between men and women who receive an education beyond high school.

This is to keep teachers in line because another problem is some teachers, not all, but some are just there for the paycheck, and that's not what we need in our education system.

Also if the kids are more mobile than their parents, they could have parents that didn't go for the higher education so it was easier for them to be better than them. I wonder if in the future, if the roles will change and men will have a bigger desire to seek more education or if the women will continue to outshine them and eventually be thought of as more. \n\nThis graph shows the percentages of the newer generation getting more education than the last.

An issue that may be attributed to this may be the gendered stereotyping that takes place in the work place. Women in the majority of workplaces are less likely to be hired than a male of the same qualifications. In today's age of social improvement, a lot of auditions or interviews are conducted in such a manor that gender discrimination cannot occur. However, the gender blind cannot always happen. This is why women are on the rise in higher education, because they have to seek out more qualifications to obtain a job in the modern work force. \n\nI wonder what would happen to the data if a segment including standardized testing would be added to the table.

I think it's about how Korean think education important relative to the other countries. If I compare the educational system between South Korea and the United States, Korean gov. offers free education till secondary school while US gov. offers free education till high school. But, In spite of that fact, In the historical context we had dramatically rapid economic, social growth after the Korean War. And one of the reasons that we could accomplish this growth is parents generations' hard work and focusing on future generations' education. They wanted to give us economically, socially better country. They thought the only way to succeed and contribute to country is to study hard and to get professional careers in terms of long-term growth. I think that fact impacted how our educational system is like. Also, because of this historical context, there are thoughts that teenagers should go high school after secondary school. To tell you my personal experience, almost all of my friends went to high school after they graduated middle school. I would say it's kind of against the conventional thoughts not to go high school. (But it's not about the whole Korean population! My parents doesn't think it's necessary to go high school or university.) And I think those two graphs shows well these facts.
