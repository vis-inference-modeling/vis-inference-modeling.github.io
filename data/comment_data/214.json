The government makes nickels for 13.8 cents but a nickel is valued at five cents and here is your problem. It takes 2 nickels and 4 pennies to make one nickel so the government is losing alot of money which is very bad with the growing national debt.\n\nThe graph says in about 2003 the Nickel and Penny started to lose the government its money. So I did some research and in 2026 they will stop making Penny so the government will lose less which is good. The Penny will stop in 2026 which would be about 22 or 23 years of the government losing money on the Penny. The nickel will still be produced but it loses more money than the Penny. So how long can the US government do this? Now I say that it is irritation to get rid of the nickel because so many things go around five but the government needs to do better cost control on the nickel.\n\nNow on the other hand Dimes and Quarters are doing very well and have not crossed into the unprofitable zone.\n\nIn summary the nickel needs to be cheaper to make and the government needs to do something about it.",

In 2024, it costs 3.7 cents to make a penny, 13.8 cents to make a nickel, 5.8 cents to make a dime, and 14.7 cents to make a quarter. That means pennies and nickels actually cost more to make than they\u2019re worth. The rise is especially sharp for nickels and quarters.\nWhat I Wonder\nI wonder why the cost to produce coins has gone up so much\u2014especially for nickels. Is it because of rising metal prices, inflation, or changes in manufacturing? I also wonder if the government might stop producing pennies or change the materials to save money.\nHow This Relates to Me and My Community\nCoins are still used in daily life, like vending machines or parking meters. If it costs more to make them than they\u2019re worth, the government could raise taxes or cut costs elsewhere. Also, if pennies or nickels disappear, it could affect how stores price items or give change in my community.\nCatchy Headline\n\u201cIt Costs More to Make Money: Pennies and Nickels Lose Their Value in Production\u201d",

They are represented by a red line once it passes the dotted line indicating the coin's value. In contrast, dimes and quarters cost less to produce than their face value, and these lines are entirely grey, not passing the dotted line. I also observe that manufacturing costs have increased moderately, with a significant rise across the board around 2009/10, before decreasing and then starting to rise again. I wonder why these costs fluctuate so often. I also question whether the discrepancy between the cost and value of pennies and nickels means production of nickels might stop soon, since they plan to stop making pennies. Will they change materials instead? This impacts me and my community because it directly reflects the nation's economic state. Eliminating some coins also indicates changes in payment habits, as people turn to cards and Apple Pay instead of carrying cash. \"Penny Nickel Dime\"",

The starting values of the coins production is also much lower in the dime and quarter than it is for the pennie and nickel, meaning that since those coins hold less value, it is more difficult to produce them to prices that match or are below their value. I also noticed that all of the lines of each coins price to produce mirror each other and spike and decline at similar rates. \nWhat do you wonder?\nWhat has caused these massive spikes in the coins' production, doubling the cost of making pennies and nickels, and significantly raising the price of making quarters and dimes? I also wonder what economic situations have occurred that have led to these major spikes or declines in the price of production. If this affects the value of my coin, and if it costs 5 cents to make, why is it worth 1 cent?\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to my community because coins are still a prominent currency today, and if they cost more to produce than their value, then how does this affect the worth of my penny?

    "comment info": "In this graph I notice four different graphs showing how much it costs to create each coin. The penny and the nickels graph is red, while the dime and quarters line is grey. This is because in the graph there is a grey dotted line representing the worth of each coin. If the statistic line is over the dotted line then it is red, displaying that the government is losing money by creating these coins. For instance a nickel is worth 5  cents but to produce one nickel it costs 13.8 cents in production. The graph is also showcasing how the price of manufacturing has changed from 2001 to 2024. I wonder why each coin has become more expensive to produce? Is it because the materials are more expensive or because inflation is causing the price of money to go down? I also wonder if the government will get rid of pennies and nickels because they are causing the government to lose money, I know that this has been talked about before. This relates to my community because it is causing the government to lose lots of money on things that are not that important, such as a penny.

However, only the penny and nickel cost more than the actual coin is worth to make. The cost of the penny and the nickel started out as their value but continuously went up. But both the dime and the quarter have not yet gone above their actual value. The nickel seems to be the one that is rising the most and the highest above its worth. \n\nWhat I wonder is if the metal of the coins is affecting the cost to make it. Only dimes and quarters are made of copper, and those are the only ones that are above their value to make. Maybe copper is becoming harder to find and more expensive to make into coins.\n\nThis relates to me and my community because I have a jar of coins in my house with many pennies and nickels.

On the other hand, the ratio of cost to make and value of a quarter and dime is much more balanced. \n\nThis makes me wonder if the material used to make pennies and nickels is harder to obtain than that of dime and quarters.

Connecting this with the ever increasing line that is given, I can see that the price it takes to make these value coins are skyrocketing. Looking at the cost of this production increase makes me wonder why we keep using coins and why we can\u2019t fix this problem. I think I understand that the price goes up as the source for materials we need decreases due to supply and demand. This relates to me and my community because this causes inflation in the economy. This affects all prices of products that me and my community use and buy. It also affects people when we simply go out to eat with each other and see menu prices increase. Going on a date or hanging out with friends to get a drink, where we see drinks increased from $5 to $7. Especially for teenagers like myself, it\u2019s hard with inflation like these, we don\u2019t have as much of an income or we don\u2019t have an income at all to be able to hang out with our friends. This can also tie into small businesses having a hard time surviving with little workers. As it is equally as hard to be able to fund labor and pay workers, teenagers can struggle with getting jobs as it\u2019s hard to provide pay.\n\nA Nguyen, FVHS",

There is also a noticeable drop in the cost to produce coins around 2020 when the pandemic was happening.

I also wonder what will happen to prices as we phase out coins like the penny (and presumably the nickel later), since prices will be rounded up to the nearest 0.10\u00a2 since pennies and nickels will no longer be in circulation. Alternatively, people will most likely start paying with card rather than cash in order to make sure that they only have to pay as much as they need.

There also seems to be a dip around 2020 among all the coins, where they actually became cheaper instead of continuing the trend of increasing cost.\n\nI wonder what the full graph for a longer time period would look like, and also whether the trend of phasing out coins (like the penny) will continue until we only use dollar bills.\n\nThis could cause prices to rise slightly for every product over time, as it would be illogical for prices to end in .99 if pennies are no longer in circulation, or for prices to end in .05, if nickels do not exist (and it is very unlikely that corporations\u2014or anyone for that matter\u2014would opt to round down their prices, rather than round up). Although the numbers are very small, they do add up over time given the amount of products the average consumer purchases. The middle-class and people with stable incomes likely won\u2019t be as affected, since these people also generally pay with card rather than cash, but those less fortunate may have to create an even stricter budget to afford the most basic products. Another factor would also be the effect it has on taxpayer money, as phasing out coins that do not pay themselves off would save lots of money that could be redirected for more useful expenditures.\n\nWill the Nickel follow the Penny?",

You mention a trend of phasing out coins. Is there a trend? Do they produce fewer coins today than they did 20 years ago? You make some good points for phasing out coins.

    "comment info": "Something that I noticed about the graph is the cost of what it takes to make a nickel and how it breaks the general trend of the relationship between coin value and cost to make. Despite the nickel being one of the least used coins, its cost to create brings up the essential question of whether or not we should continue the minting of nickels and whether or not to abolish it as a whole. Furthermore, as the use of app payment or cards increase in communities such my very own, the thought of using physical currency such as coins becomes an afterthought or even a nuisance in daily life as many people would rather give away or toss their change aside. Tying back to the question asked earlier, the fact that a nickel costs more to produce than a quarter and that coins are becoming increasingly less used in our daily lives, the idea of halting the production of nickel becomes less of a radical idea. Lastly, a head line that I\u2019d give for this graph is, \u201cAre Nickels Worth More Than a Quarter?\u201d",

Over time, the expense of manufacturing them has fluctuated, sometimes rising and other times decreasing.\n\nWhat drives these changing production costs? It might be linked to the materials used or shifts in metal prices. Alterations in design or manufacturing processes could also influence how expensive the coins are to make.\n\nThis issue connects to our everyday lives because if the government continues to lose money on low-value coins, it might eventually stop producing them altogether.

Why do we still use this form of currency if it makes the government lose money and it just costs more to do anything with it. \n\nHow this can relate to me and my community is that this graph can show the overall effect of making this kind of currency, and that it can make getting money in general worse. This can cause inflation to also be bad because it takes more to make the coins than to get what they need back to continue to make these coins, which will end up in the civilians in the community having to pay more out of their hard work to pay for it. \n\nPay it, Make it, Lose it",
