The thing I\u2019ve always heard about pricing for rings is that you are supposed to spend 2 months of your salary on an engagement ring. The graph has a significant drop off after about $3,000 dollars. There are of course outliers for the incredibly wealthy, with a spike in the data at 15,000+. But what really interests me is that the second lower graph shows that the people spending two months salary on an engagement ring are those who make less than 23,000. While anyone making more only spends around 2 weeks salary.  I wonder if that puts more strain on a poorer couples relationship, or if it means more because of the effort put into having enough to buy an engagement ring?",

Usually, people with higher incomes would spend more on engagement rings since they have more money, while less well off consumers pay less. However, it was the complete opposite. Those with less than a $23,000 salary use 1/6 of their wages, while the highest income bracket of $90,000 spends 3.1%. I wonder if this is caused by hubris and humility. The latter might be arrogant and greedy, believing that they should keep most of their money and spend a little on a perceived small matter like engagement rings. On the other hand, those who can't live successful lives try to find other ways to live happily besides money, thus focusing on their partner. \n\nIf I could create a catchy title for these two graphs, I would use \"Engagement Rings Defy Logic!\" This is due to the fact that while many believe it's important to have a significant other, the graph demonstrates that very little money is spent on it, and if a considerable amount is used, it is usually by people with low incomes.",

People who are paid less on the bar graph paid a bigger chunk of their annual income on engagement rings, up to 17%. The Stat Nuggets cleared things up by explaining the layout of the histogram. The x-axis are in $500 intervals and the y-axis are the number of people according to Stat Nuggets. They also explained the graph being skewed and unskewed which I attempted to explain in earlier comments, but they did it much better.",

As depicted in the graph, there is a connection between ring price, number of people, average income, and percentage spent. Having this many variables an bring lots into question. For example, we may wonder are the richer people spending more or re they getting married more?, we can ask the same thing about the lower income individuals. We can also ask why a spike in the 15k price point exists? is it alluding to a separate group of individuals, and are these people represented in the income graph?",

Are the people who are spending 23,000 really sacrificing so much money for a ring, or is it just how much the ring costs. Same for the richer people. Are the spending just as much money as the people with less than 23,000 income or does the percentage of the income look lower since it's less money for them?",

As the price of rings increases, the number of buyers decline. Less than 100 people are prepared to pay in excess of 3000 dollars. 10 to 15 thousand dollar rings are only purchased by less than 25 people. As the price of the ring increases, there is a decrease in the amount of consumers. In the bar graph, describes the annual income and the share of income spent. People with 23 thousand of annual income buying an engagement ring used 16.7% of their income or 2.2 months. Whereas the 23 to 40 thousand dollar group and the 40 to 50 thousand dollar group spent 4% and 3.7%, respectively. As the income rises to more than 90 thousand dollars, this group of people spend 1.6 week or 3.19% of their share of apparent tincome hat more people buy cheaper rings and more expensive rings use a lower share of the annual income.",

I notice that not a lot of people want to buy rings that $15k and more and more people would like to buy $1k under. What is the difference between a ring that cost a lot and a ring that would be under $1k. This bar graph is like a downhill graph because the people that like to buy rings that are under $1k are probably not that expensive, but then i don't think that they would care about the quality of the ring and they think that they would get another one that would look the same. If you buy a large ring that cost a lot won't that be more of a cost but then won't the probably be rob for having that ring because a lot of people think that \"oh they are rich let rob his place\". I think that the bottom graph is that people would have to give a bunch of money that they get and then the people would not care about the amount of money that they have to pay for the  engagement ring. So i think that if you have a bigger annual income you would probably have to pay more and then they have to pay more for every week that they are in. So i think that it better to get a ring that is under $1k so that you don't have to pay that much and then you can save some money every week because they would only need your money.",

This high spending makes it so that the wallets of the people buying are hurt due to the sheer amount of money they are willing to spend on wedding rings. Because of this, it's no wonder why people seek a cheaper alternative to this problem. I wonder what people do in order to fill in the gap of income money they have used. Do they work extra?

I think the union of two people doesn't need to be such a huge deal but in the society that we live in it is always made out to be this huge process when it doesn't need to be.\n I respect the group of people who spent less money on the engagement ring because they will probably be more fiscally responsible and it can help them later in life.",

They show the true character of the individual and the values they possess.

Additionally, those who earn less than $23,000 annually will spend 16.7% of this income on a ring, which is 2.2 months worth of their earnings. Individuals who earn more than $90,000 only spend 3.1% of their income, meaning that only 1.6 weeks of their earnings go towards the engagement ring. By taking a step back from the graphical data, a class divide is emphasized largely through the part of the graph illustrating the percentage of their income that is spent on an engagement ring. Lower middle-class and lower-class people can be significantly harmed due to this institutionalized cultural value of purchasing an expensive physical manifestation of one\u2019s love for their partner. This possible harm towards one\u2019s financial well-being causes these rings\u2019 importance to be questioned. If there was another socially acceptable way to propose to a loved one that did not cause one to spend 16.7% of their income, would there be a small percentage decrease in the class divide or low-income levels? This graph illustrates how much an adult will spend on an engagement ring. The majority of the population sampled spends between $1K-$3K on a ring. This trend could reflect on how many Americans can not afford to spend more than that range of money on a single physical object, while very few make enough annually to spend $10K or more on an engagement ring.",

Below the histogram, around 16.7% of people whose income is less than $23,000 would have to work 2.2 months in order to get the ring, while for people whose income is more than $90,000 would take them 1.6 weeks. \n\nWondering: I wonder how the majority of people only spend 1K on a ring, while the minority of people would spend more. \nAnother wondering is why does it take at least 2 weeks for people with lower income? Is it because of their hourly wages?\n\nTitle: Valentine's Day: Which is the cheapest ring?",

The bottom graph shows the annual income of people, and how much time it took for them to to save up for their engagement ring. So shown in that graph, people with a smaller annual income take more time to save up for the ring compared to others with a greater annual income.",

However, the graph has a negative connotation the rest of the way, until you get to $15,000, which I believe it for the more wealthy people, but in my mind it is also due to the fact that it's such a wide rage of numbers, it includes anything above $15,000. I am very curious to know how the graph would change if we take more information from more days, sense this graph only includes a few days from January.

    "comment info": "At first analysis of the provided graph from The New York Times, I noticed a graph that showed a decay or a depression. The graph compares the percentage of people from a study, and the amount the person spent on an engagement ring. The graph shows a prominent decay in the purchase of a ring as the price reaches an estimation of $2.5 thousand or $3 dollars. As the amount required to purchase the ring continues to increase the number of people willing to spend that amount decreases, which is until the final amount presented. At $15 thousand an increase of people that were able or even willing to purchase an engagement ring of that price.\n\tA more interesting aspect of the graph is the comparison of the annual income of an individual and the share of income spent on an engagement ring. The lower amount of income an individual made seemed to correlate how long they spent on either saving a ring or how long it would take to remake the amount they spend on a ring back. For example, an individual who made less than $23,000 a year would have to spend more than two months re-earning money back, whereas a person who made $23,000 to $40,000 would have to spend only two weeks.\n\tThese graphs bring an interesting insight into the financial side of engagement rings and the financial impact they can have on an individual. While the meaning behind an engagement ring is typically more important than the financial worth, the impact of the cost is just as important as the meaning.",

This tells me that people usually purchase rings less than $4,000 but some will purchase a ring at about $15,000.  I wonder how much people spend on a wedding if their annual income is more than 90,000.

I also noticed that the more expensive the engagement ring amounts to, the less likely people will buy it. I was able to surmise that when people have a meager income such as $23,000 or less, it takes them a little over 2 months to be able to afford the ring. On the other hand, if a person makes an annual income of $90,000 or more, they are able to buy the engagement ring in a little under 2 weeks. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder if  a person with a smaller annual income were to start saving for a more expensive ring far in advance, possibly a year, would they be more inclined to buy a more expensive ring or buy the cheaper ring?  I wonder about this because usually when a person has a smaller income they act more frugal with the money than someone with a larger annual income. People with a smaller income could likely be more inclined to make a more financial meager decision than the financial wealthy.\n\nWhat do you think is going on in this graph?\nThe graph shows that when a person has a smaller income it takes up a larger share of their income that means they are probably going to be less likely to buy a more expensive ring. This means that if a person with  much larger income wants to buy an engagement ring, they will be more inclined to buy a more expensive ring because the cost of the ring would take up a smaller amount of the person's income.",

I see that a lot more people tend to spend somewhere in the $1,000-$3,000 range than anything else, and the amount spent steadily decreases from there. But, at the end, there is a small spike at the $15,000+ range. This part interests me. It seems that the standard and most affordable price is around $1,000-$1,500, and that is what most people pick because of their budget. As seen in the second graph, it is most common people spend around 1.6-2 weeks worth of their annual income on their engagement rings. But this brings me back to the spike in the $15,000+.

More than 250 people buy rings that are 1k, while less than 50 people buy rings that are 15K+ or more. Additionally, people who are able to buy a far more expensive ring are more likely to buy a ring for a little more than 3K, just falling short of 7.5K, more than 10k, and more than 15K. \n\n2.) I wonder what the exact numbers of annual income are. I think just summarizing their annual incomes makes the area gray for those in 23K-43K. These could possibly be individuals who are able to buy rings that are a little greater than 3K rather than those with a higher income. The gray area could possibly hold surprising results.\n\n3.) The graph is the result of those with varying incomes and the most preferred amount of buying a ring for their significant other based on their estimated income. This graph is also showing how long it takes for an individual to pay off that ring based on their income range compared to those with greater or less income.",

Something of immediate notice on this article as a whole is that the date shows that the data was posted on the 12th of February, 2020, a time which has not yet come to New York. The most notable part of the graph itself is that, as far as the data on the graph shows, people buy more cheaper rings rather than expensive ones. Which is understandable, rings are expensive in general. What is interesting in this data, however, is the fact that after a steady decline in purchases as prices rise, there is a spike in the amount of people buying rings for $15k+.\n\tA question as to what the reason is for this data comes to mind after seeing the anomalies in this graph. Because as expensive as engagement rings already are in general, it would make sense that people should not buy as many expensive rings as much as cheaper ones. Especially when considering that engagement rings are separate from wedding rings, some people may want to spend more on wedding rings because they may simply mean more to both the givers and receivers. Yet after a cost of 15 thousand dollars per ring, people start buying again.",

The second thing my eye is drawn too is the Huge discrepancy in portion of income, between people making less than 23,000 and everyone else.\n  I suppose it's not surprising that the people that make the least play a larger portion of their income on engagement rings but what is fascinating how the discrepancy is set up. After you get out of the >$23000 bracket the rings portion of income almost Plateaus at 2 weeks. Where the lowest bracket is chilling at almost 2 months. Now this could be because engagement rings don't scale down to that low of income. It is also going to be affected more by extremes as the amount of starting money is already so low. Keep in mind this bracket could contain anyone making less than $23000. Which is where I have to believe the discrepancy is created. Look at all the following brackets, whose proportions are relatively even.\n  I have sort of already mentioned it. I believe the > $23000 bracket is being raised most by people making much less than $23000. Such as a homeless man buying a ring with 8 months savings. Other than that the graph is pretty relaxed with proportion of income trending slightly down as income increases. The first graph does have a spike at the 15k+ price but that should be no surprise as the price includes the infinity above it. Those are the only considerable outliers.",

It starts off with more people buying cheaper rings, and as the ring price increases, the number of people decreases. Then at 15k there is a slight jump. On the second graph the trend is also pretty consistent. From $23,000 to $90,000 the amount of time spent is almost the same. And then at the less than $23,000 mark, the number jumps to something 4 times as much. Both graphs show common trends when it comes to money. The more money you have the more you can spend as well as the smaller period of time you have to save for.\n2. I am wondering why there was a sudden jump when the first graph reached $15,000. The graph is fairly consistent until it reaches the very end. At the $15k the graph spikes and the current theory I have is that there are a very small percentage of people who are extremely rich and only they are able to spend that much. \n3. I think what is happening in the two graphs is that within the first one is that there are more people who earn small amounts of money and since the average price of an engagement is around that amount, more people are willing to pay that much. For the second graph I think that the people who earn more money are willing to save for similar periods of time. On the other hand, people who earn less are willing to save for longer because they have to save for longer to buy an averagely priced ring.",

I wonder if this data can be used to evaluate the hard work and salary in different racial-economic classes. If these were based on different factors, such as race, gender, occupation, and age, would the graph trend the same way?\n\tEssentially, the lower amount of income a person generates, they are more likely to spend a greater percentage of their income on the engagement ring.

In addition, less people spent more on engagement rings.\n\nI wonder why there is a spike at the end of the graph. The graph steadily decreases from being very high at the beginning to going very low at the end. However, there is a spike in the graph at the very end, but the article doesn\u2019t really explain.\n\nA larger number of people spent less on an engagement ring, and only a small number of people buying engagement rings spent a lot of money. Around 250 spent less than 1K on a ring. Nonetheless, only a few people spent almost 15k on a ring.",

Due to the fact that Americans on the lower end of the income spectrum spend longer saving for an engagement ring, as shown in the second graph, numerous Americans are choosing to buy less expensive rings. Additionally, the income gap in the United States ensures that the vast majority of Americans are not able to spend an exorbitant amount of money on unnecessary items like engagement rings. \n\nI wonder why there is a spike in the number of people purchasing rings over $15,000.  I wonder why the group that makes $23,000 to $40,000 spends so much less time paying off their ring than the lowest income group. I also wonder what the average cost of a ring is for each income group. I think those added statistics would shed some light on exactly why each income group has the time frame that it does to save up for the ring. \n\nThe graph overall shows the general trend of income that someone makes versus how much they spend on an engagement ring. There is a substantial drop-off after $3000, showing how Americans are generally spending a lower amount on engagement rings overall. This trend may be due to people making less money overall or people just choosing to save their money.",

The majority of spenders paid less than five thousand dollars. A surprising amount of people who had an annual income of less than 23 thousand paid roughly 30 percent of that income on a ring. \n\tMy first thought is to wonder why lower income people spend such a large portion of their wages on a single time ring. I also wonder how these people compare to someone who spent proportionally less with the happiness and success of their marriage.\n\tThe first graph shows the actual amount of a population spent on their engagement ring and the second graph shows the ratio of money spent to income earned.

The graph shows that people are spending less on engagement rings, but the trend is interrupted when the price of rings hits 15k. People of the lower income class tend to spend more of their income on rings, which shows the pressure in the United States to demonstrate your wealth. \n          I wonder why the number of people spending $15k on rings is so much higher than the price ranges before it. Also, why is it that people are spending less or around $1k for a ring, when before rings were used to show wealth. Is this graph showing that the US is moving away from showing wealth through material items, or is it just a coincidence that people are buying cheaper rings?\n        The graph shows that people overall are buying cheaper rings, but there are outliers by the $15k range.  The chart under the graph also shows that people who earn less money spend much more of their income on rings than those who make more money. This is because a larger portion of their income has to go towards purchasing a ring than those who make more money on average.",

There is also a significant amount of people who spent over $15,000 on an engagement ring. However, people with the lowest incomes spend the largest amount on their engagement rings. This indicated that they are spending the most amount on rings as opposed to wealthier people.\n\nI wonder why engagement rings are so important in society. It is strange to see people spend 20% of their income on a very expensive ring. I also wonder if they could afford such an expensive purchase. The purchase of a ring, if you cannot afford it, seems like a bad financial decision to me.\n\nThe first graph follows a decaying pattern. As the price of a ring increases, the amount of people purchasing it at that rate decreases.

In the second graph most of the incomes and time is around the same but if you make less than $23,000 annually then it will take much longer to pay for the ring based on your salary.\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why there was such an increase at a ring that was $15,000 compared to the rings that cost less but were still really expensive.

I wonder if that surge of people towards the end occurs because the type of people who spend more than $7.5k are likely to have plenty of money to spare, so instead of just buying any other expensive ring, they just go all-in and buy an INSANELY expensive ring.  If that makes sense. I\n     In the second graph, I notice that---based on the x and y axis values---rather than comparing the amount of people buying rings of various prices, it is comparing the percentage of someone's income that is spent on a ring in various annual income brackets. I wonder if this data could be used to analyze the dedication and commitment present in different socio-economic classes. Based on the graph, if it could be used in that way, then since people of lower income have more difficulty paying off their rings, and spend a large percentage of their earnings on it, then it can be assumed that they are more dedicated to their marriages. But obviously, this is a bold assumption and there are many other factors that come into play when determining the level of commitment present in a marriage, but it is fun to wonder if there is any sort of correlation there.",
