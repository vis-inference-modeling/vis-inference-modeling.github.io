Moreover, it was interesting to see that most of the jobs that are in the middle of automatization are located in the center of the quadrant.\n\u2022 What do you wonder?\n     From the quadrant, I wonder can there be a difference in variation between related professions and the difference between automatability and the location in the quadrant. For example, I wonder, can lawyers and judges be distinguished in their level of automatization and required skills? Also, I wonder, can these qualities determine a better job? Also, I wonder how they decide the level of automatization because some job such as airline pilot can be atomized by AI.\n\u2022 What might be going on in this graph?\n     \"Can the difference between the median wage be a determining factor for the degree of job value?\" From the quadrant, I notice that some jobs that have more emphasis on communication and thinking have a higher median income. Also, less automatized jobs tend to have higher median income compared to its counterpart.",

I found this particular graph to be very thought-provoking. It seems as though there are more jobs on the right hand of the graph, indicating that there is a greater number of jobs that demand physical labor. This makes me think, which is more difficult: a physically exhausting job, or a mentally draining one? I suppose the answer to that question is subjective, and I\u2019m not even quite sure which I find more arduous. I predict that this trend will discontinue, as over the past several decades technology has gradually replaced human labor, with no indication of ceasing anytime soon. With that stated, I think that the result will be an increase in jobs on the left half of the graph. Moreover, I find that this graph is relevant to fellow \u201cGen. Z\u201d students, for it may impact our decision on which career path to take, as most would not want to pursue a field that can be replaced by technology. What are the implications of a larger amount of occupations necessitating brains over brawn? Perhaps, for instance, do those with jobs requiring more intellectual expertise receive more pay, or more, should they? Adding, what is the significance of the green and purple colored text?

Additionally, the viewer of the graph can see the average salary as well as the number of individuals working within that field.

I found this particular graph to be very thought-provoking. It seems as though there are more jobs on the right hand of the graph, indicating that there is a greater number of jobs that demand physical labor. This makes me think, which is more difficult: a physically exhausting job, or a mentally draining one? I suppose the answer to that question is subjective, and I\u2019m not even quite sure which I find more arduous. I predict that this trend will discontinue, as over the past several decades technology has gradually replaced human labor, with no indication of ceasing anytime soon. With that stated, I think that the result will be an increase in jobs on the left half of the graph. Moreover, I find that this graph is relevant to fellow \u201cGen. Z\u201d students, for it may impact our decision on which career path to take, as most would not want to pursue a field that can be replaced by technology. What are the implications of a larger amount of occupations necessitating brains over brawn? Perhaps, for instance, do those with jobs requiring more intellectual expertise receive more pay, or more, should they? Adding, what is the significance of the green and purple colored text? Is it to make the graph more easily interpreted?",

The more south the occupation lays on the scale, the more the employees work with operating machines and process.

Finally, the more north the occupation lays on the scale, the more emphasis is placed on clerical and service work. The occupations can lay in a quadrant which links them with more than one category. For example, word workers are to the right and down, meaning they are physical workers who work with operating machines and processes. What absolutely intrigues me about this graph is the fact that it is interactive as one can search for a job title and see where it lays on the graph. Additionally, the viewer of the graph can see the average salary as well as the number of individuals working within that field. This graph could truly help one better understand what they want to do with their life, depending on how much/little of something they want (e.g. less physical work).

I see that there are four points on the graph labeled as more emphasis on communication and critical thinking, more emphasis on clerical and service work, more emphasis on physical work, and more emphasis on operating machines and processes. This is showing where these different jobs lie on in each of the four categories. I wonder why the graph is mainly just broken up into two colors for the less automatable and more automatable and what exactly that entails. A name for this graph could be jobs colored. This may work because it is breaking up jobs and labelling them by color and the green appears to be more on the left side of the graph and the majority for the purple is on the right side.",

This graph may be used by students or individuals searching for jobs as a tool that tries to express the specific emphasizes that a certain job or career entails.

It also seems that the left side, i.e. the \"emphasis on communication and critical thinking\" is further to the extreme than any other. Interestingly Physical work and Clerical and service work seems to be denser than Operating Machines and Communication and Critical Thinking. The second and forth quadrants stay closer to the middle point while the first and third stray further away.\n\nI'm wondering: What the reasoning behind the color choice is; Why Communications and Critical Thinking stray so far from the origin of the graph; Why the 1st and 3rd quadrants are so far from the origin; Why the 2nd and 3rd quadrants tend to stay closer to the origin; Why Clerical and Service Work are the furthest from the extreme.\n\nAs far as a Headline: Surgeons Do Less Physical Work Than Photographers? It's More Likely Than You Think.",

Big companies are looking to increase their profit margins in any way they can and when the technology is there they will begin replacing humans with machines.\nI hear a lot of politicians say that the labor and manufacturing workers displaced by machines will be replaced with programming and administering machines, but I think there is no way to give all those displaced by machines jobs administering them.",
