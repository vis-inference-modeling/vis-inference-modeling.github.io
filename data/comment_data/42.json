The NAFTA tariff treaty allowed corporations to acquire cheap labor in foreign countries, removed factories, and businesses from these regions initially. However, Trump has been encouraging more companies to return to America.

Thus, areas like North Carolina and Texas are favorable, creating more jobs and an expanding population. The Northern \u201crust belt\u201d states never regained those corporations, rendering them with a decrease in population that never returned.\nIt is strange that Utah experienced a significant spike in growth throughout the majority of its counties.

Since most of the graph is purple and purple represents 0% to -10% change in the working age, shows there was no change or even less of a change in the work age then previously.I wonder why there is a change in the working wage in the west and less populated areas, rather then the north east including cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Boston. I find this very interesting for these densely populated areas would seem more likely to have a change in the working age since there is so much opportunity for work. What's going on in the graph, is the percentage of change in the working age between 25- and 54 throughout America.

Thus, areas like North Carolina and Texas are favorable, creating more jobs and an expanding population.

I find this very interesting for these densely populated areas would seem more likely to have a change in the working age since there is so much opportunity for work.

But when you go to the west the population seems to increase a fair amount. The southern countries see some increase in some areas. This increase and decrease is due to people becoming older. In 2007 there were people in the working age, but as they got older they exited the working age. As more people enter the working age it turns more orange. In the areas that are purple, more people exited the working age than entered it. In the orange areas more people entered the working age than exited it.

I have noticed that almost all of New England is marked with light and dark purple which means the population has either decreased by 10% or stayed the same. This is true most likely because of an increasing amount of young employees that obtain careers at a younger age than 25. The only noticeable orange area is located in New York City, which experienced an increase of the working population by 10% most likely due to increasing jobs and job stability for older employees. I also noticed that on the west coast in states like California, Nevada, Utah, Washington, and even up north in Alaska there is a considerably large amount of orange displayed in the graph which could mean there is a significant amount of employees that are young or older employees that have better job security.\n\n I wonder why New England is almost totally purple. Is it because they have a large amount of young employees? Why is the working population on the west coast made up of older employees (as seen by the large amount of orange)?  I also wonder how much of an effect it would be if the graph included people that are 16-24 years old because they are the minimum age to work. Would adding the large amount of young employees to the graph make it increasingly more orange than it is now?\n\nIs the Rise In Young Employees Harmful or Helpful to the American Workforce?",

I also notice that the mid west and west coast are less populated in 25 to 54 year olds working. I wonder why Florida does not have more 2 to 54 year olds working as this state is a popular retirement area for older age groups which makes me believe that not as many older age groups would be employed.

With its abundance of jobs attracting more people of the working-age to move there it makes sense that it would have such a high amount of orange.

Thus, areas like North Carolina and Texas are favorable, creating more jobs and an expanding population.

I find this very interesting for these densely populated areas would seem more likely to have a change in the working age since there is so much opportunity for work.

Maybe People too young or too old moved away, and people between 25 and 54 moved in.\n   Now, if I wanted to catch people's attention about the job inflation in the east-western part of the map, I would have, \"What has jobs for adults? East-west! It's the best!\"",

The NAFTA tariff treaty allowed corporations to acquire cheap labor in foreign countries, removed factories, and businesses from these regions initially. However, Trump has been encouraging more companies to return to America. Upon return, these companies decided to relocate to desirable areas considering variables such as weather, lower taxes, and location. Thus, areas like North Carolina and Texas are favorable, creating more jobs and an expanding population. The Northern \u201crust belt\u201d states never regained those corporations, rendering them with a decrease in population that never returned.\nIt is strange that Utah experienced a significant spike in growth throughout the majority of its counties. I am not familiar with the economy or landscape of the state, and question what job opportunities are so plentiful there.",

Since most of the graph is purple and purple represents 0% to -10% change in the working age, shows there was no change or even less of a change in the work age then previously.I wonder why there is a change in the working wage in the west and less populated areas, rather then the north east including cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Boston. I find this very interesting for these densely populated areas would seem more likely to have a change in the working age since there is so much opportunity for work. What's going on in the graph, is the percentage of change in the working age between 25- and 54 throughout America.  A catchy headline that captures the graphs main idea is Does a new percentage of age changes give more work gains?",

In 2007 there were people in the working age, but as they got older they exited the working age. As more people enter the working age it turns more orange. In the areas that are purple, more people exited the working age than entered it. In the orange areas more people entered the working age than exited it.

I have noticed that almost all of New England is marked with light and dark purple which means the population has either decreased by 10% or stayed the same. This is true most likely because of an increasing amount of young employees that obtain careers at a younger age than 25. The only noticeable orange area is located in New York City, which experienced an increase of the working population by 10% most likely due to increasing jobs and job stability for older employees. I also noticed that on the west coast in states like California, Nevada, Utah, Washington, and even up north in Alaska there is a considerably large amount of orange displayed in the graph which could mean there is a significant amount of employees that are young or older employees that have better job security.\n\n I wonder why New England is almost totally purple. Is it because they have a large amount of young employees? Why is the working population on the west coast made up of older employees (as seen by the large amount of orange)?  I also wonder how much of an effect it would be if the graph included people that are 16-24 years old because they are the minimum age to work.

The lighter orange and lighter purple is somewhere in between the 10% decrease and increase. It is interesting to see that generally, the states in the mid-west/west and south have a lower change in working age while the east and northeast have a higher change in working age.

Maybe if the age range was 16-54 the graph would look a lot different. It could also be technology taking away jobs from many working people.

There are of course the areas you would expect to be on the rise for the working population as well such as the majority of California, or the District of Columbia (Washington D.C.), and of course New York City. The area that strikes me as the most outstanding is the amount of purple in the Midwest. The majority of the flat plains are in dark purple with the occasional smattering of some golden color spread throughout. I think that this may be due to advancements in industrial technology such as improved farm equipment and the replacement of humans in large scale production with robots. The last thing I noticed is that the age group they considered to be \"working age\" is excluding the school-age part of the population. \nI wonder...\nI wonder what is bringing in more \"working age\" people into the northern most region in Alaska. I also wonder why they chose to exclude teenagers and school age kids in the data. Considering the increased pressures modern teenagers face when looking at the skyrocketing price of college, there is a newfound expectation for teens so that they eventually can pay off their enormous debts.

Due to the fact that this graph is focusing on a trend in the working-age of 25-54 year olds, I believe that graph is displaying the amount of immigrants in the work force.  I say this due to the fact that the majority of the orange colored sections are along the country's border- which is obviously a hot spot for immigration.",

    "comment info": "Okay so is it possible that this is related to the decline in human workers? Here me out, so most of the purple is concentrated north-east and goes through the mid-west where we slowly start to see more orange pop up. The West has many cities and many people live there; but big business don't want to invest so much into people, so they start incorporating more robots which end up taking jobs away from the people. Which is why i think the title should be Gears for Hire.",
