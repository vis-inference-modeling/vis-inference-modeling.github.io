Drivers with 5 requests an hour cruise less than 4 miles.  \n2. Some drivers spend more time cruising than fulfilling requests. \n\nSome things we wondered about include:  \n1. Do the miles represented on the y axis represent the amount of miles covered? For example, a driver cruising a 10 mile radius is receiving less trip requests than a driver cruising a 4 mile area. If this is true, cruising a 4 mile radius is likely to yield the optimal trip requests per hour.  \n\n2. Where does time of day fit into this data? Is this representative of a certain time period? How does rush hour or weekend boom affect the data?  \n\n3. Does the rating of the driver have anything to do with amount of requests per hour?  \n\n4. How is the optimal number of requests determined? \n\n5. Was there a significant difference between Uber data and Lyft data?  \n\nGreat headlines from students:  \n\"Cruising or Ubering; spending too much time waiting?\" - Kaylee \n\u201cUsing gas or waiting for a task; Taking too much time waiting?\u201d - Kaylee \n\"Too Much Cruising, Not Enough Requesting\" - Mariah \n\"Cruising for Requests.\" - Tai\u2019s",

The graph shows that most drivers spend 4 to 6 miles driving around looking for requests and they get 2 to 3 requests per hour. I wonder how many drivers are around in a specific area at each moment. I wonder this because usually, the most wait that a passenger has to endure when calling an uber or a lyft is around 12 minutes.

The reason the miles cruising number is probably higher is because drivers have to drive around and cover more areas to ensure that they get those requests. If drivers stay in one area, they are less likely to get requests, but if they drive around they can get a request from one location, and then move to another to get another request. However, it is interesting to see that the trend is not necessarily more mileage= more trip requests. I would assume that this is because if a driver drives around too much, they can miss requests while passing through an area.",

When an uber driver is cruising, trying to find a request, they usually get a request within the first hour. While they are driving around, it takes an uber driver about 2 miles to get one. However, the Uber driver cannot drive everyone around. I noticed that they only drive around 2 passengers every hour. \nIn addition, there are many dots piled up in between hours 2-4. This means that after driving around for a while, the requests start coming in during the 2nd hour, mostly. \n\nI wonder if this is for one uber driver only? I also wonder how many dots there actually are? How many people, on average, were included in this survey? How much money to the drivers averagely make on one trip?

There seems to be no title for the graph and I recommend the title needs to be \"Miles Cruised vs. Trip Request\". The dots mostly commences at X axis 2 and graduates slowly to 4. There also is a line between 3 and 4 that seems to be a indicator per hour.\n   The dots seem to curve into a waning crescent tilted a bit to the bottom. I wonder why the graph is doesn't have a title. Why does the dots seem to be more in the area of the X axis of 4 and increases more up at the 2 X axis and  8 Y axis.",

Why when drivers have fewer trip requests do they cruise more?  And why when they have more trip requests they cruise less?
