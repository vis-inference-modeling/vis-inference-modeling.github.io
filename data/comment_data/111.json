There is a clear dip in the price of gas during the middle of the pandemic which is predictable since not many people were going out at that time because of the lockdowns. With the lift of the lockdown restrictions, people started going out a lot more so that can represent the sudden rise in gas. The other reason is the change in administration and the mistakes that have been brought with it like canceling the keystone pipeline along with other conflicts caused by the current administration are the likely causes of the rise in gas prices.",

I understand higher demand for gas now that more people are getting back to normal life routines but the price rates proving deflation on television from 2019 until now also makes sense because of the many alternate devices which you would now not necessarily need to purchase television. However I question why now?. Especially when the pandemic first struck and mandates to stay at home were issued I would think that if anything the demand for such items would be when the pandemic first occurred. Cars are now at higher demand so is gas which is unethical for lots of people because transportation is becoming more unaffordable. The rise in gas prices are insane and were very sudden. Prices always change but never to this extreme. This affects the economy significantly because if prices and demand is rising more people won't be able to afford living expenses.

This could be related to both the shortage of cars being manufactured and the shortage of gasoline, causing the prices to raise. On another note, the prices of televisions experienced a gradual increase, which is much different from the prices of 2019 to early 2020. People were spending a lot more time at home watching shows and movies, so wanting to purchase televisions would make sense.\n\n2. I wonder why the prices of eyeglasses and eye care didn't experience a very noticeable change. I'd assume that people who worked remotely would be using screens all day, so glasses would become more necessary during the day.\n\n3.

When Covid-19 hit around April of 2020, there was a huge decrease in the prices of gasoline.

Then now into 2021 the demand for gasoline is getting larger as people go out more, so there was an increase in price.\nQ.2 What do you wonder?\nWhy is eyeglasses and eye care a category?

I also wonder, why is it such an array of random items on this graph? they aren't really related in any way, and there was no big change in the prices of most of them, so what was the point of putting say, chicken on the graph? Why not put on something that was really affected like toilet paper?

By just glancing at this graph, one would think that the price of gas and vehicles has gotten higher every month. But because the graph is compared to the previous years prices, this is untrue. While it is true that prices for these things have gone up, because they were so low at the same time the previous year, the are about the same that they were before the pandemic started. This trend is consistent more or less throughout the graph. Also, because the prices are not compared to the previous months, they are not going up month to month, they are only higher compared to last years prices. Also most of these products have reasons other than inflation for their increase in price e.g. televisions because of the perceived shortage of computer chips, gasoline because of the increase in oil prices, and used vehicles because of the shortage of chips to make new vehicle, limiting the supply of new vehicles, thus creating a higher demand for used vehicles. I wounded why the graph is comparing prices from the previous year and not the previous month. I also wonder why these specific products were chosen to be in the graph.",

The main thing that I noticed with this graph is that past 2021 the prices of most of these products have increased greatly after in most cases a steady decline or just a small amount of increase occurring each month. What I've also noticed is that the prices of televisions steadily decreased each month (20%) into mid-2020 and then from there began to increase into now, with a 10% increase starting into 2021. Another thing that is prominent in this graph is that the prices of gasoline have been unsteady going up and down over the years and recently began to rise with an over 20% increase. I think that this is due to the changes in fossil fuel digging over the years and that more recently the supply has become scarce causing the prices to rise.  This is similar to the recent increase in the price of used cars as the computer chips that are needed to make them run have become difficult to find and produce. I wonder if the prices will continue to increase for both these items and others over time or if after a while of increasing they will begin to decrease at some point. I also wonder if since materials are becoming scarce for a lot of things if companies will stop production or if they will continue to produce them but at a large price.

I also noticed that gasoline prices depend on how much is on hand at the moment. In 2021 the prices are starting to spike because there is either less on the Earth or they are unable to find a lot. Eyeglasses and eye care has been steadily increasing for a while but not a lot each year. About halfway through what is shown for 2021 the eyecare is slowly decreasing which could be because of a cheap alternative for eyeglasses or contact lenses. Sports equipment is slightly increasing probably because of the more safety measures they have to put in that cost more to make. As an athlete, I have noticed that every year that I get new equipment there is always a new safety measure and costs more. In conclusion, almost every category has the prices increasing which could be a bad thing. It just depends on how much the value for money is changing.\n\nI wonder why chicken is growing in price because you would think that because of the bigger chicken-producing farms they have more chickens so less money.

I think this is because businesses were closing, and things were shutting down because they didn't have enough money to pay for the shop, so thats why everything was more expensive because their was a shortage. An example not on this graph is toilet paper. For some reason everyone wanted toilet paper, and you couldn't find it ANYWHERE. It ended up selling for more, and you could only buy a certain amount. It was crazy. Because of COVID-19 the sports equipment dropped in pricing. I believe this is because nobody could do any sports, and nobody was buying their things, and they needed to stay in buisness so they lowered their prices.",

Leading up to the past two years, everything seemed normal, with slight inflation and and deflation patterns, but has shifted in the past two years. I wonder if this was caused by the pandemic, and if there have ever been similar patterns like this in recent history.  I also wonder whether they will go back down, or if everything else will inflate alongside it.  Prices affect everyone in the community, even on things like chicken.  Used car prices and gasoline have inflated the most, and this is a big factor for my community regarding how everyone drives, and even a slight price increase can have a big effect on the local economy.

A lot of recent trends can likely be explained by the Coronavirus pandemic because under the pandemic people were not buying as many products and services because of the stay-at-home order and economic crisis. This is shown especially with the price of gasoline, as it experienced a large amount of deflation in 2020, as people weren\u2019t driving as much to go places. But in 2021, as the mask mandate has lifted, places are reopening, and people are returning to their job sites the demand for gasoline is much greater than in 2020. The same explanation can be used for sports equipment, as the pandemic restricted and decreased the amount of sports activity.\nA2:What is making television begin to go up in price again? What is responsible for the recent inflation in home furniture? What part of the pandemic made chicken\u2019s price inflate in 2020? How are lower-income people ever going to be able to afford a car if both used car and truck prices and gas prices are rapidly inflating? \nA3:These are all products we consume, and in some cases rely on.

Suppliers of meat, (Farms), had to cull livestock as there was no place to take their product. Now the supply chain is behind as there is a lack of product that would have already been in the loop and being process now erased. Processing plants are no longer issue, they are caught up but there is a lack of product for them to process.

Gasoline is the one that increased the most in 2021, I mainly believe that is because it is starting to become more and more scarce. TV does cost a lot individually compare to all the other categories but it has been decreasing its price since 2019, this is because more and more TVs are being massive produced. However, soon as 2021 hits, everything started to become scarce. Eyeglasses and eye care's price did not change at all is because this field of the business tends to have a constant purchase and production. The demand and supply never change unless some terrible event happens such as widespread eye diseases. This will most likely cause the price to rise because more people need this service now.",

In my community, the gas prices have gone up tremendously in the past 6 months. I wonder what this is exactly from. I can infer that COVID has had a big impact on these rates. Used cars and trucks have also been impacted tremendously by inflation. The automobile industry is getting hit very hard, most likely because of the reopening up of the country. I also noticed that the price of home furniture is starting to go up. The shipping wait for items is so long because everything is so backed up. Most people buy their home furniture off of websites and so the prices are going up because of how long it takes to ship things now. Sports were at a stop at one point because of COVID and now that schools and towns are starting up sports again, inflation has increased. A big question that I have is when these inflation rates are going to go down. COVID has had such a big effect on the economy and inflation and so I wonder if in the future the rates will go down or maybe go back up. This affects my community because the gas rates in my town are very high and, just like the rest of the world, the shipping times for so many online items is so long.

I also noticed that gasoline and used cars and trucks increased more then 20% which shows that anything related to automobiles will most likely increase in price. I think Eyeglasses and eye care is decreasing in 2021 because it isn't something everyone uses.

For example, I noticed that the price of sports equipment has gone up recently, which is likely due to the fact that sports teams and recreational sports activities have seen a return to action recently as vaccines have come out. In my community and many other communities, public school sports teams have been brought back. I also noticed that the price of used cars and trucks have gone up as well, which may be due to the fact that more and more people are traveling by car, again due to the release of a COVID-19 vaccine. Also, as businesses come back, so does the demand for used trucks for shipping. Also, the price of home furniture has gone down likely because fewer people are spending time in their homes quarantining.

Do you think the price of shipping went down because gas was cheaper?  Or did the shipping keep their prices the same and then just made more money because they were paying less for gas?  What about airlines?  Everything is so interconnected, I wonder if any other prices dropped because of gas prices dropping.  \n\nLikewise, when the gas prices rose, I wonder what else rose in price.  \n\nDo you think the rise in prices recently made up for the drop in prices in the past so the gas prices are back to where they used to be in 2019?  Is that what you see happening in Andover?",

This is drastic due to gasoline just undergoing a drastic decrease in price in 2020. In comparison to used cars and trucks who steadily increased in price, gasoline had the most drastic change in the graph. I also notice everything slowly inflated overtime, which shows how much the economy has changed in such a short time. \n2.

This leads to me believing everyone is beginning to watch shows on their cellular devices instead of actual TV, lowering their value. I also wonder why the economy changed so much in such a short period of time. Why everything inflated in two years and why some changed drastically. \n3.

I also notice how gasoline (all types) and used cars and trucks' prices increased the most over the four other products, especially in 2021. However, gasoline prices increased more suddenly than used cars and trucks in 2021. I wonder why gasoline prices decreased exponentially in 2020, and then suddenly increased the same amount in 2021. I believe this graph is showing seven different product groups and a timeline of their inflation and/or deflation over the last three years. My guess for the reason behind the gasoline prices deflation and inflation in 2020 and 2021 is because of COVID-19 regulations lessening in 2021 since 2020's nationwide quarantine. Also, since the last election, the average price per gallon of regular gasoline in the U.S. has increased by 75 cents. This graph relates to me and my community because it affects my families' average spending on these everyday items which affects our financial state. We also have more than one car, so gasoline prices affect our lives every time we have to fill our gas tanks again.

All prices are not going up or going down.  Why do you think each of these seven consumer products changed their prices so differently?  There are different reasons for each.  It\u2019s a very worthwhile wonder to ask if these price changes were seen throughout the country.  The reason for the price increase of each may indicate if the increases regional or nationwide.  \n\nBy Friday, we will reveal the free link to the article that included these graphs.

The covid pandemic starting in late 2019 led to nation wide quarantine causing a significant drop in usage of vehicles more specifically cars. Thus leading to the dramatic drop in gas prices in November 2020 dropping by 20% in the average gas price compared to the average gas price in 2019. Gas\u2019s November 2021 dark red arrow icon represents an 20 percent increase in average price over November 2020 average price which can be linked to President Biden\u2019s actions as gas prices were below $2 per gallon the day Biden took office. This rise in gas prices caused my parents to begin driving as little as possible to reduce the amount of money spent on gas. The graph represents the inflation which we might not notice which may affect our daily lives more than we think.",

The gasoline spike during 2021 is what most caught my eye because it is strictly dark red which shows the great inflation of gas prices.\nI wonder what caused such an increase of prices especially in gasoline, used cars and trucks, and even televisions. Specifically for gasoline, I remember shortly how there was a gas shortage throughout many states, and I wonder if that had anything to do with the increase prices of gas because the less gas there is, the more pricey it could be since everyone uses/needs it. I also wonder if COVID had anything to do with inflation of gas prices because throughout the beginning of 2020, that's when the lockdown happened which people were not allowed to go out meaning that gas was not much needed since people stayed home. But as we go through 2021, that's when lockdown wasn't as strict and everyone wanted to go out which increased the need of gas. \nThis relates to myself and my community because these are things that I will end up paying for in the future and as well as now. And if we go on in the same rate then there becomes an even more increase of prices which will most definitely affect our future generations. \nThe graph is showing the inflation of prices of certain things throughout the past years and how many of those things have become much more expensive. \"Higher Prices, Danger Rises\".",

Something I noticed is that the gasoline prices were at an all time low during the time that the pandemic hit, but rapidly inflated matching the inflation levels of the used vehicles. I think sports equipment was mildly popular, but due to the social distancing and restrictions, people would only buy gear if they could play a sport. \nQ2. I wonder two things why didn\u2019t eyeglasses and eye care take a bigger rise, as I believe staring at a screen is never a good thing, especially fo flours on end? And would computers hav been a better statistic than chicken due to the demands that normally is there, but also with the increased demand with the pandemic?\nQ3. I think the the spike in the used cars and trucks began in June 2020, so by that point, people like me were sick of being at home and wanted to maybe travel around. Given COVID-19 was prominent, people in my community didn\u2019t use buses and things like that, so I believe that could be a trend everywhere. My family actually bought a car during the pandemic so we were directly affected by the cost increase due to inflation. I think the chicken price also affects me as my family tends to buy much more chicken than any other meat, so chicken being inflated for a span of over a year recently means we spend more on chicken than we should.\nQ4.

Even the economically most prosperous countries are still not recovering, and this is what we are currently seeing with inflation in the United States. The graph shows how prices have skyrocketed by 10% to 20% in the cost of gasoline, home furniture, some foods such as chicken, sports equipment, and new and used vehicles. The shortage of these products is the leading cause of the price increase due to global supply chains and the lack of people to enter the workforce. \nThis economic phenomenon can bring significant consequences for the world economy. The planet continues to show us how vulnerable our economic systems are. Therefore, We should take advantage of this opportunity and this financial crisis to seek alternative solutions that can allow us to move forward.\nIn the case of the increase in the price of vehicles and gasoline, many governments could be motivating their citizens to purchase electric cars, whose maintenance is much cheaper and environmentally friendly. Moreover, the oil industry should be reduced or ended soon for the benefit of all.\nAnother essential aspect that we as citizens can consider is to promote local purchasing.

The most significant decline was gasoline when the pandemic started in March of 2020. The most significant incline was just after 2021 for used cars and trucks. I think this is because of the demand for a vehicle because there is a shortage of materials. I wonder why television prices are going up after the pandemic because people aren\u2019t home as much but during the pandemic people were home and the prices were relatively low. This relates because I remember filling my tank for $15 during the pandemic and now it is more than triple of that for the same car.",

I imagine these items were the ones chosen to compared because each one (with the exception of Gasoline and Used cars and trucks because they both relate to the automotive industry) adds to the diverse influx of prices; it shows this was not just inflation in one industry but widely effecting.  From examining the trends, I concluded that Eyeglasses and eye care was the sole data type that did not increase in price over the past year.\n\nWhy were Eyeglasses and eye care unaffected by this wide-scale, hybrid, inflation? I wonder why there has been such serious inflation over the past 12 months? Has the supply chain collapse had an impact on the recent lack of goods or high expenses?\n\nMy community is greatly affected by these price increases because even though the costs of goods are increasing, income is not. We are now forced to survive on what we have been producing (income) but account for the rise in prices of food, gasoline, furniture, etc. which is very challenging. It is a difficult world we live in and inflation is just one of those imperfections which make life resemble a rollercoaster. \n\nUnderstanding the graph represents the alteration of prices over the years, an appropriate title for this graph would be:\nThe Price's Flight",

The gasoline graph does show that in the last 3 months of 2020 the consumption of fuel had gone back up.

The graph could help people in the community, if they were looking to buy a Used Car and Truck or buying Sports equipment or Televisions by showing that they should buy it now instead of waiting later because later the price would increase.

I also noticed chicken stayed at 0 during 2019 and 2019 and increased in 2021.\n\nI wonder what is the name of this kind of graph.\nI wonder why was the price of chicken so low in 2019 and 2020 but higher in 2021.\n\nThis would have an impact on me and my community because if the prices of gasoline and cars and trucks keep inflating, it'll cost too much for people to pay so it'll be less people traveling with cars and unable to get to places quicker. Chicken is a common food eaten at all homes, restaurants. etc but if the prices of it keep inflating, less people will buy it. \n\nThis data is about the inflation and deflation in prices from the year 2019 to the year we are in now, 2021.

Not even just food in general just chicken specifically. What I wonder is that why is chicken and sports equipment relevant here. I just seem to comprehend that, they could have just put food in general and yes there was the lockdown and no one could buy food or do much but generally speaking why was chicken so special that it needed its own category. Maybe fast food chains since everyone love chicken nuggets and sandwiches. Also sports equipment\u2026 it doesn\u2019t seem like something serious since there wasn\u2019t much of a change up until the end of what I assume is 2020. The impact that this has on my community is that maybe people are spending more because they are afraid to take public transportation and thats also probably why used cars, trucks, and gas prices went up because people are buying more cars so they can maybe stay safe. Also I feel like another impact might be that people are starting to hoard things because since the prices went down then they started to buy more of that since it was so cheap. I think what this graph is showing is the price fluctuations in certain things like chicken (still don\u2019t know why thats there) and how they may have gone up in recent times.

From 2019-2020 there was a pretty consecutive price (with subtle changes), but when we get into 2021 the increase in inflation is a lot easier to see in television. The gasoline inflation jumps all over the place here. Used cars and trucks seems to have a consistently low inflation rate up until mid 2021. The eyeglasses and eye care was pretty consistent.

Do the colors represent the variance of revenue in terms of constant deflation or inflation?\n\u2022 How does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to my community because household items in popularity are represented in this data graph. As something like technology or a television set shows a significant deflation before 2021, home furniture remains in almost constant inflation. These compare because they are both house hold items that are not bought frequently in my community, but show in this data set a variation of data. This leads one to infer regardless of equal popularity in a product in my community, the deviation of prices can range from a large variety of inflated or deflated prices.\n\u2022 What\u2019s going on in this graph?

Gasoline shows the highest increase, and eyeglasses and eye care have seen the least increase in prices. I notice that the categories don't really seem to be related to each other in any way, except for gasoline and used vehicles.\n\nWhat do you wonder?: I wonder why these specific categories of products were chosen. Chicken and eyeglasses don't seem to fit into the same category as all the other products, so I'm interested in why they were added. Were these categories chosen by importance, or by how many were sold?\n\nWhat impacts does this have on you and your community?: This impacts me because these are all relatively common products my family and I buy. My mom owns a car and buys gasoline, and I recently got new glasses. Because we purchase products like these, we can plan ahead to see what may be more affordable or expensive now.\n\nWhat's going on in this graph?: This graph shows seven different categories of products and uses colors and arrows to show whether they have decreased or increased in price as compared to twelve months prior. It uses red to signify an increase in price and blue for a decrease. it shows prices starting in 2019. The products with the most change in prices are televisions, used trucks and cars, and gasoline.

Not even just food in general just chicken specifically. What I wonder is that why is chicken and sports equipment relevant here. I just seem to comprehend that, they could have just put food in general and yes there was the lockdown and no one could buy food or do much but generally speaking why was chicken so special that it needed its own category. Maybe fast food chains since everyone love chicken nuggets and sandwiches. Also sports equipment\u2026 it doesn\u2019t seem like something serious since there wasn\u2019t much of a change up until the end of what I assume is 2020. The impact that this has on my community is that maybe people are spending more because they are afraid to take public transportation and thats also probably why used cars, trucks, and gas prices went up because people are buying more cars so they can maybe stay safe. Also I feel like another impact might be that people are starting to hoard things because since the prices went down then they started to buy more of that since it was so cheap. I think what this graph is showing is the price fluctuations in certain things like chicken (still don\u2019t know why thats there) and how they may have gone up in recent times.

The inflation of prices will influence your spending throughout the years. Throughout the years the prices of things that are bought a lot have increased. This is proven the best with cars/trucks and gasoline. With trucks and cars in 2019, the inflation in prices was only up 5%. Now in 2021, it's up almost 20%.

This could be an important factor when it comes to the economy, which could be a bad thing or a good thing. I also wonder why the prices of the other items have barely changed.

The government spending definitely has a direct impact on the rates of inflation, as does covid-19. Covid-19 is making it much harder to ship pieces for cars and other items, causing a low supply and high demand.",

Are these products the most effected by economic fluctuation? Are these products deemed 'most important to Americans'?\n\nWhat quantifiable value does each tic in the chart represent?\n\nWhat is this data based off of? Is it an average of all brands? Is it a survey?\n\nWho made this chart and what was he/she's motive (bias when creating this data)? Are the colors blue and red (used to represent inflation and deflation) chosen to perpetuate extremities?\n\nDo these fluctuations have to do with covid-19? What impacts did the pandemic, and the economic recession it caused, have on the data? How is it reflected/represented?",

I bet together you would find answers to most of them.  \n\nBy Friday, we will reveal the free link to the article that included these seven graphs.  There you will see the 179 consumer product and services price graphs.  I picked these seven graphs.  Why these?  They were products of interest to students and showed a variety of price changes.  Which consumer product and services graphs from the 179 graphs surprise you?  Why are you surprised?",
