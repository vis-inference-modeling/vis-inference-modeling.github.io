Since many don't want to leave their homes, electronic business has boomed.  This includes gaming an electronic shopping.  I wonder how we will change spending in the long term when living in isolation, and possible with a reduced income.",

When I first saw this graph seeing the mobile industries on the left side confused me, as well as Charitable giving as there have been many news articles on people donating medical supplies and food to hospitals and unable neighbors. \nI would wonder what kind of financial situation these six million people are in, whether those chosen were from a variety of economic statuses or incredibly similar. Another factor to consider would be where in the US these people live, as living standards tend to vary in the US in terms of price.\nLooking at the industries whose employees and workers were most affected by the pandemic we see Supermarkets and e-commerce. Recently my mom has told me about several changes made in the nearby supermarket to prevent spreading. Although now,  most people order groceries online as well and pick them up later, which is also why there's such a large increase in spending on online grocers.\nGenerally it seems that most industries have increasingly less profit, which makes sense as the economy thrives on human interaction. By the time this pandemic is over, it\u2019s likely that there will be a lot of recovery needed for our economy.

It makes sense, because everyone is eating at their own houses which means they need more groceries and it\u2019s not entirely safe  to go to the grocery stores right now. I would have never thought gaming would have been the second highest spent, but it makes a lot of sense, because everyone is bored and trying to find fun things to do like gaming. I was a little confused why charitable giving was in the red, but I guess everyone wants to stay apart so it\u2019s hard to give charitable gifts. \n\nI noticed that Movie theaters, Airlines, and Gyms are all the least places people are spending money on right now due to nobody wanting to spread germs, but they are thinking of different ways to promote their businesses, for example you can now rent movies online from amazon prime, and other movie providers, which I think is so awesome that are technology is so advanced and it comes in handy especially in times like these.

Not to sound arrogant, but a swift analysis of the title and axis of the graph make it fairly easy to understand.\n The graph is about \"Pandemic consumer spending\" and while the balls move towards the positive direction on the x axis, the change in spending during the pandemic increases.\n With that being said, the reveal wasn't entirely obvious beforehand. I think an important fact is that this graph only represents a small section of the population, and a fraction of their spending at that, so there's a very real possibility that this entire graph is arbitrary.",

Additionally, spending on necessities such as groceries and other food items (e.g. meal kits) has increased dramatically. This is feasible since more people are confined to their homes and cannot eat at restaurants or partake in leisurely activities outside. On another note, I wonder why charitable giving has gone down... I initially thought that spending on charity would increase, because people would want to help those less fortunate than themselves during this crisis. However, it appears as though people are putting their own needs first instead of considering those of others in worse situations. In this way, the graph also serves as an interesting analysis on human behavior- while spending on streaming and video games have gone up, charity has decreased. For this reason, a catchy name for the graph could be \"Covid Spending: Self Over Sacrifice.\" This is a time when we should be helping others, which should be highlighted over consumer purchases.",

The small businesses are suffering because the online shopping bubbles are so large.\n\nI still wonder how many people they surveyed for this graph and if It could have changed if they surveyed more people.

Many local businesses here are still open to online shopping and you have a delivery option or curb side pickup from the store.

Things as simple as, being around another human being, transportation for those who still have jobs, and spendings or savings for money. All being backstabbers to the way we now live.  As communities, businesses, people, cities, towns, and industries are quickly having misfortune. As this graph pinpoints how COVID 19 changed our spending habits, having outcomes that are both superb and atrocious. Resulting in industries skyrocketing in success, while other industries are plummeting, rapidly failing. I\u2019m not stunned by these results, as they are self-explanatory. I don\u2019t find myself questioning why, airlines, movie theatres, fitnesses, cruises, etc having fewer sales, making profits decline. Emphasizing how numerous people are opting to stay indoors than risk going outside. Even something as simple as the color, in this graph, shows the negatives and positives.

This reveal has made me wonder more about people locally than people nationally and globally. Many people in my town depend on travelers; many people own and work at beach-front and historic downtown/river-front restaurants and stores. Even though we have few cases (when compared to some other states), I can't help but be concerned for most of the people in my community. What will their lives look like in the next year, without tourists, and probably without as many local customers as they've had in the past?\n\nI also wonder about the net effect of COVID buying habits on a small and large scale after reading the Stat Nuggets. The net effect is altogether negative, meaning that most purchases are in decline, with a few exceptions. However, some areas are inevitably more or less affected than others; New York will be more affected than Montana, obviously, but what about places around North Carolina? What about small towns with little to no cases of COVID? What about cities that have many people working like normal (just from home instead), or make a large number of online sales? I suspect some people/areas will benefit from our COVID chaos while others definitely don't, but either way, the net effect will be what affects all of us for the months (years?) to come.

Upon closer observation one can see how mostly all the struggling industries are all entertainment industries, more specifically industries that get most of their revenue from  mostly middle class people. This could be due to the fact that many people of this  status are the people who have enough money to spend on entertainment things, but are not extremely wealthy, so are now being very precautions in spendings on non necessities. Another important factor that I noticed was that many of the industries that are going below what they made last year usually flourish in this spring summer portion of the year, such as cruses, and air lines. With these declines being in their busiest months it could be even more costly to them.\n\nI wonder\u2026 It is interesting to me that the amount of money spent on charity has gone down in trying times like these and honestly quite saddening, but again it is most likely due to people frugalness in these times where our economy is in flux and people do not know if they will come out of this economically sound. Another interesting statistic is that the home improvements industry seems to have gained around 15%-20% more income than last year, and this is so interesting because it seems to be a luxury to do home improvements, but people are not shying away from spending money on that sort of thing. \n\n-Caroline Keohane 8th grade",

While 6 million people surveyed sounds like a lot, compared to the roughly 328 million people in the US, it's a small data pool. Some people during this pandemic probably aren't even buying very much anyway. This graph doesn't show those people either. It doesn't show how people are saving money during this time. It just implies that instead of splurging on airplane tickets, they're splurging on video games. \n\nOne thing that this graph has showed me is that the economy is changing drastically due to Covid-19. It doesn't show how popular those industries shown were before the virus, so I can't tell if they're on the verge of going bankrupt, but I know that some businesses will and already have gone bankrupt. If enough places go out of business, our spending habits could permanently change.\n\nMaybe Covid-19 just accelerated some of the processes that were going to happen anyway. Technology is growing increasingly popular, so maybe the increase in video game sales might have gone up anyway. Maybe some of the small businesses were doomed to fail anyway, so maybe some of the changes in sales are less because of Covid-19 and more because of peoples' changing tastes.",

Naturally, with the stay-at-home orders, there would be an increase in sales for gaming and online groceries, granted, as explained in the stat nuggets, those industries are still relatively small. \n\nAlthough opening businesses up too early may be a fatal mistake, it is impossible to stay closed for such a long period of time. The graph clearly shows that people aren\u2019t spending their money on local business, and those stores are feeling the repercussions of that. It makes sense that people aren\u2019t going to their local barber shop or brick and mortar shop. It makes sense general merchandise and ecommerce is a significantly larger bubble than fitness\n\nAlthough the reveal provided a great deal of information that made the graph more understandable, I still left wondering whose spending was tracked in this. Was it the wealthy in the gated community or the local businessman who just went bankrupt? Six million people is a large study group, but does it represent the wide diversity of wealth and status that exists in America? Does this study truly represent all the different walks of life in America?",

Just like you said, do the six million people really represent everyone in America? \n\nObviously, wealthy families spending quarantine in their gated communities would purchase different items than families living from paycheck to paycheck. The fact that this data was taken from credit and debit card payments can show that maybe this doesn't reflect everyone.",

Something I noticed is that many pleasures, like theaters, have lost lots of business, along with transportation, since most of us are staying home.  Since many don't want to leave their homes, electronic business has boomed.  This includes gaming an electronic shopping.

Also, despite the fact that people have been buying more food at once, people who stock up on food one week might not have to go get food the next week. \n\nI am wondering about why mobile services have decreased.

It's compelling that our brains may make this type of association subconsciously. \n\nI noticed something that I hadn't before today, warehouse clubs, places where you can buy large quantities of food in bulk, are still receiving the same amount of revenue that they were before the pandemic. This makes me contemplate, why aren't people choosing to buy in bulk? Especially now, when grocery stores are jam packed and supplies are running low? Rather, it seems that more people are interested in grocery stores delivering and purchasing meal kits. On some level, this makes sense, but personally, I would think that people would want to buy copious amounts of food and supplies during a time like this, just in case. \n\n I expect that for the most part, the spending habits will remain relatively the same for all humans until this comes to an end. \nMy final catchy headline that I think best represents what I see today is: Looking at Spending Habits From a Distance.",

After reading the Stat Nugget, I learned that many industries are struggling like Brick and mortar stores, dine-in restaurants, and travel agencies and have lost 50% or more of regular sales. It puts the virus in perspective as not only threatening our health, but threatening our economy, jobs, and potentially our way of life. \n\nWhen I first looked at the graph, I knew it was terrible that some major industries were plummeting. After the reveal, I realize the incredible impact of these industries. Food, travel, and transportation industries provide tons of jobs to keep the economy healthy. Most of them have fallen past 50%, and about 16 million workers have filed unemployment because of the virus.\n\n I believe that this graph is saying if we don't begin to salvage these \"pillars of American Industry,\" we are going to suffer heavy losses in the economy. Coronavirus seems to be the only thing on everyone's mind, and staying safe is the number one priority. Still, the economy is slowly spiraling, and we need to try to get back to the standard way of life to save both American's health and wealth.",

Instead of spending money on fast food, airlines, apparel, etc, people are now spending money on home improvement, merchandise, online stores, and gaming.\n\nI wonder why supermarket spending has gone down. Ther are tons of people that go to the supermarket even with the coronavirus because its the only way they get food. Maybe people stocked up beforehand or simply can't afford food.\n\nIn this graph, people are spending more on home improvement, games, alcohol, and video streaming because people are getting bored sitting in their houses all day. People are getting food from meal kits, online grocers, and food delivery because it is safer than going out to the store. Less money is being spent on mobile, charities, and apparel because people do not have the money to spend because they are unemployed. Less money is being spent on fitness, cruises, airlines, lodging, and movie theaters because they are all closed. A good name for the graph could be \"how pandemics change consumer spending.\"",

This time of crisis forces us to spend our money wisely, on the things that are essential. It is very eye-opening for many Americans because many of us have never had to hold back from buying something because it wouldn\u2019t fit in the budget. \n\nThe world is not only suffering through a pandemic, but it is also suffering through an economic crisis\u2026 or maybe not? Millions of Americans have filed for unemployment and others have suffered extreme salary cuts.  Some might say the economy is collapsing, but what about the places that are thriving during this time? I have never seen our grocery stores constantly packed as they are these days, or the local home-improvement stores have lines out the doors with a massive parking lot full of cars. Though most look at this time of disaster as deliberating, it is refreshing to see all the people who are taking advantage of this time to invest in themselves and/or their homes. Although financial investments are plummeting, there is nothing more profitable than your individual investment in yourself.\n\nConsidering that the American lifestyle is to work and provide money for your family, this change is so unusual to our country, and I wonder if it will permanently change our culture in the future.\nHeadline: \u201cHow Covid is Infecting Our Economy.\u201d",

Even in this time of economic struggle and crisis, we have found that the real effect on a lot of people's day to day lives aren't that drastic. \n Now, that's not to say no one is feeling the effect of the coronavirus- people certainly are-, but the economic turmoil we see, quite frankly, means more to business than it does to the people who don't own the businesses. The Dow-Jones plummeting is bad for the people who own corporations or invest in stock, but it's not as terrible for everyone else as one would expect it to be.\n This is really evidenced by increased spending on luxuries such as video games and alcohol.

Since these bubbles represent industries and the percentage of spending that is being made towards those industries it\u2019s clear to see that there are more industries that have suffered from the isolation of society to those that have gained. Many of these industries are related to or involve traveling (seen in Airline, Cruises and lodging) or social interaction and usage of a communal area (seen in Movie theaters, Fast food, Fitness and charitable giving). \nMeanwhile on the right we can see industries that can thrive through online interactions, gaming or delivery services as people become less willing to go outside.\nSome industries are surprising to see where they are on the graph. I expected mobile to actually be used more since people would spend more time calling mother but I suppose that when you're in the confines of your home there are other methods than calling and cellular data wouldn\u2019t be needed since there\u2019s internet service. Another strange one is Home improvement. You\u2019d think letting a stranger in your house to fix it while in quarantine from a virus would be the last thing one would want to do, so I wonder if there\u2019s another way that that industry is growing, as well as why people are suddenly investing in the improvement of their homes. \nI was thinking about the phrase \u201c in a nutshell\u201d except this time with bubble.

Some items shown on the graph are things like airlines and movie theaters, and while some people might rather stay at home, those who liked going out will still do so. People who like to travel are going to travel as much as they can once they get the chance because the virus probably would have made them even more stir-crazy than before. With the creation of streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, people were already opting to stay inside and watch movies there instead of going to the theater, so the number of people who choose to watch Netflix rather than go out to see a movie probably won't change.

Therefore, with this being said, many movie theatres, restaurants, gyms, and airlines have closed.

Another source of the outcome, is through online purchases, gaming, and other essential goods. \n\nI wonder what this graph will start to look like once we are further into this lockdown, when even leaving your homes for essentials might be even more dangerous.

Covid-19 has caused people to be trapped in their homes resulting to more spending's via essential supplies, delivery and home oriented things.

In my opinion, I think it would make more sense for charitable giving to increase because the poor may need help in times like these.

It also seems as though more people are trying to waste as much time on fun or time-consuming activities now that they don't have anywhere to be or anything to do. Looking online during this pandemic, I've seen how people have been picking up more hobbies and doing more busywork, like cleaning or fixing things in their homes.\n\nI wonder if even more people are suffering than would normally be in an outbreak like this due to the decline in charitable giving. Everyone is already suffering, but if those in need before the pandemic are getting even less help now, will they be the ones who don't survive the outbreak? The effect of the pandemic on peoples' money-use could seriously negatively effect the economy in the long run, and I think that prices could end up rising drastically when this is over, just to make up for the break.

However, sales of things that people can use at home, like video games and alcohol, have gone up. People have been using e-commerce and online grocery shopping more as well. Home improvement sales have had a marked increase also. This increase in purchasing things which can be used at home is likely a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\n       When practicing social distancing due to the novel coronavirus, people spend a lot more time at home.

They also shop online so they do not have to leave the house and risk getting sick. This is likely why e-commerce and online grocery shopping have gone up, while supermarket shopping has stayed the same. Spending on things that are not strictly necessary, like charitable giving and fast food, has gone down. This is probably because of the faltering economy giving people less spare money to donate or spend on fast food. Altogether, there are more things on the decline than the rise.

I know that gyms are closed down, along with almost everything else, but this still makes me ponder: are people still finding alternative ways of exercising such as actually going out into nature, or are they just choosing to not be active, for even a small portion of the day at all?\n\nYes, what's going on in the world right now is terribly troubling. Yes, it's all too exigent to work for home and live life at distance from those who you love the most besides your immediate family. But I think that surely the most efficient way to achieve solace during this time is to practice self-care. Staying healthy by eating wholesome foods and moving by going outside everyday are the best ways to do that. So when I look at this graph, in this moment, and I notice that food delivery and meal kits are at an all time spending popularity high for everyone, I'm happy because that means people are not only supporting businesses and grocery stores in and around their community, but they're in turn also taking care of themselves and their family.\n\nThe most fitting headline I can come up with today is- How People are Choosing to Live Through Their Spending Habits.",

    "comment info": "In the graph, I noticed that online grocers and gaming is in the lead for more spending, while movie theaters and airlines are almost at 100% less spending. I think online grocers are increasing because people would most likely want to avoid interaction with people at the grocery store, so they would less likely contract the virus, and also prevent spreading it. However, I'm not sure about why gaming has increased sales. I think it has increased because many schools across the U.S. have closed. As an effect, many students learn online and may have more spare time to play video games. \nWhen looking on the other side of the graph, movie theaters and airlines are some of the things that consumers are spending less on. I think that airlines have less sales for obvious reasons, that they're either closed, people are quarantined, or that no one would like to have a higher risk of contracting the virus. For movie theaters, yet again I'm unsure why its lost more spending than airlines. Movie theaters are a perfect site for spreading the virus, as it occupies a large amount of people. I understand that can cause plenty, if not all theaters to close.\nI wonder how the graph will change over the course of the year. I think there will be a significant difference compared to this one.\nHeadline: The Panic of the Pandemic",

Because of the decrease in fast food and the rise in grocery purchases, it's true that most people are probably eating healthier. But I don't see why they wouldn't be buying frozen foods in their groceries in addition to fresh foods (except for possibly purchases from the online grocers). I also noticed that the spending on \"fitness\" went down nearly 75%. There's a chance that has caused people to exercise less, but I know if they're anything like me or my neighbors, they've been spending a lot of time exercising on their own without a gym or new equipment, doing things such as running, walking, biking, and bodyweight-exercises.

Because people need food, this is an explanation for the increase at supermarkets, food delivery, etc. Because people are at home and not able to go out, there is a trend of online shopping, home improvement, gaming, reflecting people's hobbies. The decrease in spending trends are due to closed places (airlines, movie theaters, gyms), and the decrease in charitable giving may be due to the fact that people feel money is tight as they are not working (cannot afford it).

I believe this is because most people have turned to online shopping sites, like Amazon, for their non-food needs and wants. The negative side is logical because of the many closures of businesses, and people no longer have access to airlines, movies, or gyms. People are stuck at home and businesses offering shopping outlets and potential deals would make others want to turn to online shopping.\n\n I wonder why the size of the supermarkets and e-commerce bubbles are bigger, but the smaller food delivery is almost 50% past the more spending side. The industry sales for e-commerce and supermarkets seem to be much bigger, but the population has spent more money on the food delivery service than usual.  I would conclude that since more people are at home, there would be more spending on food. Also, grocery stores are limited in products which could mean buying the more expensive brand and costing the consumer more money than before the virus. \n\nName for the Graph: Will our Economy Bounce Back from our Spending?",

The graph appears to be right-skewed, since social distancing reduces spending in most industries. The bubbles for online grocers and gaming could be rendered outliers since the spending for these industries increased significantly by almost 75%. Spending on online grocers has increased by a higher percentage than spending on meal kits and food deliveries.\n\n\nWe wonder if toilet paper had its own bubble, how big would it be and where would it be placed? Why have alcohol sales increased more than those of grocery stores? How are the categories \u201cgeneral merchandise and e-commerce\u201d and \u201csupermarkets\u201d defined?

That plus the extreme rise in spending on gaming and streaming services demonstrates how almost everyone is stuck at home, trying to both save money while out of work and entertaining themselves in the midst of a crisis. We can\u2019t go to the gym, we can\u2019t go to movie theaters, we can\u2019t go \u201cnon-essential\u201d shopping, and we definitely can\u2019t travel, and even if we legally could, why would we what with the safety concerns and unemployment/financial hardship? The second thing I noticed was the rise of about 25% in spending on alcohol. I can\u2019t help but wonder if this points to high rates of depression and anxiety among people in this time. We already deduced that many people are staying secluded in their homes, so loneliness, depression, anxiety and fear all seem like likely results of that isolation, but I suppose boredom is also a potential cause for the rise in alcohol purchases. I think boredom is also a likely cause for the rise in home improvement spending; since we have all this time at home and we don\u2019t have much else to do, why not finally get around to those renovations you\u2019ve been wanting to do?",

How will these temporary changes affect our spending habits in the future? Another thing I wonder about as someone who values face-to-face human interaction over the \u201cconnectedness\u201d technology has given us is: will we be more reliant upon technology after this storm has passed? Or less?

I also notice that the red dots labeled with different industries represent industries with the least spending (less than 0%) and the green dots represent those with the most spending (more than 0%). According to the graph, spending on gaming and online grocers are the highest, while spending on airlines and movie theaters are the lowest. The reason for this is that the most time of the average consumer is now being spent in quarantine, and those staying indoors want food and entertainment without running the risk of leaving the house. The sizing of the dots also represent the industries with the most sales (represented by the sub-caption under the graph). General merchandise and e-commerce as well as supermarkets are receiving the biggest amounts in industry sales in regard to the graph. I wonder why the industries shown to have less spending during this time are more concentrated and greater in number than the industries that are shown to have more spending? Perhaps many of the industries and services provided by those industries rely heavily on outdoor activity. For instance, as travel has been shut down recently, the airline business has been suffering spending-wise. Possible Title: \"Online Industries Dominate during the Pandemic.\"",

Because people need food, this is an explanation for the increase at supermarkets, food delivery, etc. Because people are at home and not able to go out, there is a trend of online shopping, home improvement, gaming, reflecting people's hobbies. The decrease in spending trends are due to closed places (airlines, movie theaters, gyms), and the decrease in charitable giving may be due to the fact that people feel money is tight as they are not working (cannot afford it). It is interesting to see that people prioritize general merchandise spending over charitable donations, however. \n\nCatchy Title: \"Money Doesn't Grow on QuaranTREES\"",

The number of industries that are in the \"red\" immediately grabbed my attention, particularly from the airlines and movie theaters, which are experiencing a nearly 100% decrease in spending. \n\nThis graph excellently illuminates the fragility of the global economy. We can group most of the red into entertainment and travel industries, and it's quite astonishing to see how those two industries have led to our economy being left in ruins. It's sad to see charitable giving have such a decrease in their spending, as it leaves thousands struggling on top of the pandemic. \n\nI was surprised to see supermarkets not experience an increase in spending. I work at a grocery store, and we have seen such an influx of shoppers that we had to start limiting the number of people in the store. Some days it feels like a war zone; the masks, the gloves, the plastic shields at registers. \n\nI have to wonder what this means for people at home. Since spending is about the same, is food not short in supply? Are people not struggling to find food, or is that even a concern for Americans? This matter gets even more cloudy when we look at the decrease of spending in fast food. Where are those people getting their food, or are they?",

The government has tried to help by turning schools into places to get food, as well as putting in place economic impact payments made for families who require money. \n\nOverall though, you're right that Covod-19 is leaving a wake of economic disaster behind it. Many local places are struggling, and I believe that after this, lots of previously struggling stores might be filing for bankruptcy.",

Meanwhile, consumer spending on general needs such as food, and houseware have increased. Then, people are at home more which means more supplies and materials are used quicker than usual, and people are using things a lot so the more something is used, the quicker it needs to be replaced. I wonder if when quarantine is over, will the consumer spending on food and houseware go down to where it was before this pandemic, or will it stay higher than its regular numbers? People will always be cautious of something like this occurring again in the future. A catchy headline could be, \"Consumer spending, will it ever be the same\"?",

Major industries, such as movie theaters and airlines, have taken very heavy hits. While movie theaters have been hit severely by the state guidelines in place, streaming services have grown significantly, along with other digital entertainment services, such as gaming. Airlines, which many people previously spent large quantities of money on for vacations  or for business trips, are now not taking as much of people\u2019s money. This money is likely to have been rerouted elsewhere, such as home improvement or alcohol. While seemingly random, the large amounts of money for travel (to entertaining vacations) have been redirected towards home renovations or other at-home pleasure activities. These are the less obvious changes in expenditures, with the more obvious ones being physical purchasing of items such as apparel and food, being swapped for digital or delivery versions of the same services. This shows the forces of supply and demand in the modern market balancing out, even amidst a global crisis. The after-effects of this pandemic will be very interesting to observe later on, especially whether or not major industries that have been affected stay the way they do, or change back to the way they formerly were.",

This is out of a fear of catching corona virus, so people are maintaining social distance and quarantining themselves. \nI wonder if life will go back to normal after corona virus, or if some of these bubbles will remain on the left or right side of the graph.",

While it seems like everyone around me is still super busy, it makes sense that lots of people would have free time on their hands now to renovate their homes. You also have a good point about people stocking up on things like toilet paper and food contributing heavily to the general merchandise and e-commerce bubble. \n\nI was curious too about the lasting effects of this pandemic on our spending. Will people go back to public areas right away? Or will it take longer for everyone to readapt to our old society? What will happen to industries like public transport, movie theaters, and lodging once everything we are allowed back outside? I also wonder if online shopping and ordering will still be as popular once everything opens back up and people can go shop in person again.",

Before this whole pandemic started, I would always go out. To the movies, I would Travel, train at the trampoline gym, eat out... I always thought of these activities to have a lot of consumers and costumers. Which makes them have more money. Looking at this graph, I wanted to vision it in a different perspective. I imagined it before the pandemic started. Observing the graph that way, I would take a wild guess that the chart would be the other way around. Airlines, Cruises, Fitness... would have probably been More on the right side of this graph. While the other goods and services would go more towards the left. However, things like Supermarket and e-commerce would probably also go more to the right. Looking at this Chart in that other perspective made me realize how much COVID-19 has affected our spending.",

    "comment info": "I noticed that many of the rises and falls of major industries during the COVID-19 pandemic have balanced out surprisingly well. Major industries, such as movie theaters and airlines, have taken very heavy hits. While movie theaters have been hit severely by the state guidelines in place, streaming services have grown significantly, along with other digital entertainment services, such as gaming. Airlines, which many people previously spent large quantities of money on for vacations  or for business trips, are now not taking as much of people\u2019s money. This money is likely to have been rerouted elsewhere, such as home improvement or alcohol. While seemingly random, the large amounts of money for travel (to entertaining vacations) have been redirected towards home renovations or other at-home pleasure activities. These are the less obvious changes in expenditures, with the more obvious ones being physical purchasing of items such as apparel and food, being swapped for digital or delivery versions of the same services. This shows the forces of supply and demand in the modern market balancing out, even amidst a global crisis. The after-effects of this pandemic will be very interesting to observe later on, especially whether or not major industries that have been affected stay the way they do, or change back to the way they formerly were.",

While it's clear that a vast majority of businesses have seen some bad drops in spending, a majority of said drops being even below -50%, one of the things your eyes are drawn to first on this graph are the massive bubbles of general merchandise/e-commerce and supermarkets. Of course, it is understandable to see that people will be spending more money on these sorts of businesses. I see why these things would make sense of course. And I do not blame people in any way for going and purchasing their needs right now from industries like Amazon and Walmart. But it is just painful to think how businesses that are already always at the top of the food chain are still doing great when many other industries and businesses are struggling, by building themselves off the backs of essential workers. And it's worse when you realize it's all simply a big circle, as it is because these smaller industries and smaller businesses are struggling so much right now, that those of lower class are forced to put themselves and their loved ones at risk working incredibly hard for billion-dollar industries that pay them little to nothing because the system is built in a way that forces them to do so, so that they may give their families food and a roof over their heads. Even in crisis, it is the poor that struggle as the rich grow off their backs.",

It is so sad to think of those in abusive situations, or those in extreme poverty or those who... the list goes on and on. I am sure that a huge reason for that decrease is the fact that many people have lost their jobs or at least are having to take a much smaller salary so there isn\u2019t money for non necessities. However, I am curious if another factor of less donations is that churches aren\u2019t meeting. Many people give charity through the church or the church is involved in helping fund organizations, and people don\u2019t have the funds or the exposure to the reminder of options. I am totally not saying that you have to be in a church to be someone who gives to charity, I am merely saying that churches do play a big part of helping fund non-profit organizations.

Not just in how we go to work, or who we see on a daily basis, or when we wake up, but even in how we hold onto our money.\n This is a graph focused on people's spendings- on the profits of different industries in the midst of this chaos Some industries are booming, some industries are failing, others are beyond even that. What I will say, though, is that it all just sort of makes sense. \n Of course movie theater profits are going down. Of course airlines are making less sales. Of course people aren't going to the gym, instead choosing to work out at home, or just buy more video games and stream more netflix.  Obviously, fewer people are going to get fast food or using their mobile data because few people really have to commute, instead choosing to order food and groceries.\n Everything, down to charitable giving, makes sense. A lot of people are struggling to pay rent right now. It's hard for them to qualify for unemployment checks because of the systems in play. In general, \"poorer\" people- everyone without a large reserve of money saved for a situation like this- who might've been giving what they could, now can't give anything. Now, at first, I wanted to be disappointed in society for that. I wanted to be angry about \"hoarding money\" in a time of crisis, but I will concede that its causes make sense, so I really can't fault anyone but those in charge for it.",
