I'm also wondering if a whole area gets leaves and as much as it needs before the other states.   \n\nMy guess on what's happening here is the climate and elevations get higher and higher in the spring time in order to collect leaves and sunlight for its state and terrain.",

This is a combination of generally warm weather, the new spring season, and how cold the weather in each respective territory remains throughout the early spring.  I wonder if global warming has a significant effect on how quickly or slowly the leafs appear on the trees, and further, flowers or fruits on the trees.  A title for this  graph could be \"May Flowers: An Evolution of Spring.\"",

In fact, the blue of March goes north to the west and the yellow of April goes south to the west.  \n\nI wonder why this is so.  What do you know about these regions that could explain why months intermingle?",

I noticed that it seems the that some of the south shown in green sees there first leaf in January and as moving up it from the green region from January to April. So it is showing that the southern points see the the first leaf first and as you move norther the months are April and may. This makes sense because the southern areas are relatively warmer.

The first thing I noticed was that the more south a state is on a map, the earlier it sees its first leaf. This makes sense as the more south a state is, the closer it is to the ecuator, making it warmer. I do wonder however why certain regions in the midwest experience spring later than others. It's a very disorganized pattern, too. The creators of this graph were very creative in terms of the animation they added as it shows the progression of states that experienced spring.

This certainly makes sense, since the Southern parts of the country are closer to the equator, and therefore, they are warmer.  However, I wonder why the areas in the Midwest saw their first leaf in May, a month or two later than many states that are located further North.  The animation of the graph really brings this to the attention of the person studying it, because the areas of the Midwest are the last parts of the white map to be colored in.

    "comment info": "While Spring is only beginning to emerge here in N.J., I notice that many states across the nation are already well into its midst. The Southern portion of the country, in particular, -- including all of Florida, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North and South Carolina repset lively and parts of Arizona and California -- boasts witnessing the first signs of Spring as early as January and February, on average. A horizontal slice running through the middle of the U.S., spanning approximately from the top of texas to middle of Nebraska vertically and from Nevada to New Jersey horizontally, is said to possess an average date of the \u201cfirst leaf\u201d appearance in March. I notice that the remaining upper one-third of the U.S. typically encounters the first signs of Spring by early April, leading into about Mid-May. One element of this graph I like, is its use of different colors to display which parts of the country begin to experience Spring when. The first question that comes to mind when analyzing this graph, is why do the Southernmost states feel the effects of Spring first, and the Northernmost parts last? What is the science behind this pattern? Also, How does the official first day of Spring, or the vernal equinox, correlate with when different states witness the \u201cfirst leaf\u201d?",

    "comment info": "(Cont'd)\nWhile I know that the first day of Spring is determined by the vernal equinox, which is when the sun crosses over the plane of the earth\u2019s equator making night and day approximately equal lengths around the world, what effects might global warming have on the official first day of Spring? How might this graph be improved to showcase the correlation between when a state sees its first leaf and the official first day of Spring, as well as how the first day might change (i.e., occur sooner or later) due to the rising temperature of our earth\u2019s atmosphere? \n\nHeadline: Warmer Weather on the Way: When Will Spring Surface in Your Neck of the Woods?",

This extra exposure speeds up the growth rate for plants to sprout leaves which is why the states closest to the equator have their first leaves appearing the earliest.",
