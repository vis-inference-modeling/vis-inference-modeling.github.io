Many people died, a lot lost their jobs, and people started spending more money on food from stores instead of eating at restaurants. I also see that people didn\u2019t hang out as much, and even after the pandemic, things never really went back to normal. \n    2. What do you wonder?\n    I wonder how long these changes will last and if people\u2019s habits will ever completely go back to normal. For example, will people keep working from home, shopping online more, and hanging out less? I also wonder how these long-term lifestyle changes will affect young people like me in the future. \n    3. How does this relate to you and your community?\n    This relates to my community because the pandemic also changed the way people around me live and work. Many people in Japan started wearing masks and spending less time outside or meeting friends. Schools and workplaces moved to online systems, and habits like wearing masks all the time still remain. \n    4.

For example, the Unemployment claims graph went from fewer than half a million claims before March 2020 to over 6 million unemployment claims around March \n    2. I wonder at what point each graph starts to even out and go back to its track before COVID. Many of the graphs seem to look similar to before the pandemic, and I wonder if it was because of the pandemic ending or the improvement of the U.S..\n    3. This has made an impact on me and my community because we have seen a shift between before the pandemic, during, and after. During the pandemic, the employment rates were high, our test scores were going down, we spent less time socializing, and more. Now that COVID is not as big of a problem anymore, everything is switching back to relatively how it was before the pandemic. Some changes are not completely back to normal, such as test scores and time socializing, but we are back on the track we were originally supposed to be. \n    4. \"A ripple in time\"",

However, this surge was followed by a decrease in 2022. This decline could be attributed to lingering COVID-19 concerns, the emergence of new variants, or the persistence of social habits formed during the pandemic.\n    \n    My main question revolves around the definition of \"socializing\" used in the graph. The term is broad, encompassing everything from in-person interactions at school or social events to online communication via social media. The lack of specificity makes it difficult to fully understand the data. Clarification on the types of socializing included would greatly improve the graph's interpretability\n    \n    Like many communities, we've seen a growing reliance on social media for communication, sometimes at the expense of in-person interactions. The graph, even without specifying the type of socializing, highlights the pandemic's impact on our social lives and the importance of finding a healthy balance between online and offline connections.

After so long after the pandemic I still wonder why we still haven\u2019t been able to get back to normalcy after Covid. Another thing that bothers me is the fact that our time socializing with others have stayed so low so long after the pandemic. What would these graphs look like if Covid never happened? Would the graphs continued to stay consistent or would they still have changed no matter what? I personally think some still might have changed for the worse and some might\u2019ve done better",

The amount of money that people spent on restaurants has increased since 2020, and has surpassed money spent on groceries as of 2023.

    "comment info": "Headline: Changes in 2020: Covid-19 Impacts on the U.S. people\n    The graph shows that in 2020, there were significant changes in various aspects of Americans' lives. In terms of unemployment claims, they shot up immensely in 2020. The same goes for total deaths, used car prices, and 'how to cut your hair' searches. I also noticed that many metrics returned to their \"average\" pre-COVID-19 levels. However, some trends seem to persist indefinitely. For instance, the declining U.S. score (3rd grade through 8th) remained downward until today. However, it is difficult to say if COVID-19 caused these changes in online shopping and U.S. scores because they were already on an upward/downward trend before COVID-19. I, therefore, wonder if the impacts of COVID-19 (post 2020) on these aspects of the U.S. people's lives are as impactful as they first seem and how these aspects may have interacted with each other. For instance, do unemployment claims correlate with the prices of used cars and, furthermore, the prices/economic state of the country? I believe this graph encourages readers to examine the interplay between various aspects and to consider the broader impact of COVID-19 on these factors. This relates to me and my community because I lived through the Covid-19 pandemic. I am able to relate to several of these aspects. COVID-19 had a significant impact on me, and as a result, I can attest to the correlation between these aspects and COVID-19.",

The first shows an increase in death rates after March 2020, a direct effect of the possibly fatal disease. Unemployed claims spiked from below 2 million to 6 million claims a week, likely caused by businesses shutting down. In previous years, the amount of women in the workforce has increased but declined during the pandemic. I assume that many moms were forced to stay home with their children because they attended online school. During COVID, people spent more money on groceries than restaurants. The stark, 40% increase in used car prices shows how large an issue inflation is. Online shopping also increased during the pandemic. Socialization fell drastically in 2020 and has not recovered, showing the change in culture after COVID-19. Students from 3rd to 8th grade went from being 0.2 years ahead to being more than 0.4 years behind in grades. The final graph shows the spike in people searching  \u201cHow to cut your own hair\u201d in 2020. This is evidently due to social distancing.\n    2.

Such as online shopping, U.S scores, and time spent with others. However, some seem to be completely dependent on the pandemic, such as \u2018How To Cut Your Own Hair Searches\u2019 and 'Unemployment Rates\u2019 which can be attributed to the economy\u2019s state at the time, and the increase of time spent on the internet. I wonder what factors played a part in these roles. For example, does online interaction count as socialization, as social networks, such as TikTok, peaked interest during the pandemic. Additionally, what demographics are being polled? For the online shopping, it relates to the community, as a lack of teachers is still surging our country. As a student, I have noticed post-pandemic the lack of subs who care, and strong new hires within schools. Considering my community is very close to the D.C suburbs, women employment is a very important aspect of D.C life. The nation\u2019s capital, where the U.S is represented to the global stage, we should have an accurate image of our country and the perspectives within it. The pandemic helped shape a more adequate share of women in the workforce, which could be due to epiphanies about interests, or more time to start their own business and for entrepreneurship in general. This goes back to my original question of what factors played a role in this graph\u2019s increase.",

Trends come and go, people ultimately throw away hundreds of clothes that will impact our environment severely.

Millions of people are laid off due to the digital incompatibility of many jobs (i.e. people that are unable to work enclosed inside their homes) 3. The majority of women decide to tend to their infant children post-orders due to propensities caused by proximity and quit working initially, however because of the higher mortality rate of men, the net amount of women in the labor force decreases at a slower rate of men dying from COVID at higher rates, causing the share of women in the labor force to increase 4. Restaurants close due to social distancing so the alternative is groceries 5. Used car prices increase due to an independent factor unrelated to the COVID pandemic, the car prices should decrease as demand for transportation decreases because of the stay-at-home orders, so it is due to an unrelated factor 6. Online shopping increases due to social distancing 7. People become socially isolated because of staying at home 8. Online learning is substantially less effective than in-person learning 9. Barber shops close due to social distancing",

The first thing that I noted was the incredible spike in deaths starting around March 2020, and the spike tied to the start of the pandemic. The other major change was the incredible spike in initial unemployment claims, almost 6 million a week above anything before COVID-19.\n    \n    Another change was how people were spending their money. Grocery spending increased while restaurant spending dipped lower than the pre-pandemic level. I also found it interesting that the spikes in used car prices and the online shopping levels were both also above pre-pandemic trends. For parents, perhaps the most alarming trend is the downward trend in test scores for students, especially in math, which could potentially affect a generation.\n    \n    This connected to my own experience because I remember the school closures, the shift from in person to online, and how everyone had to adapt. All of this change in lifestyle affected academic, social, and emotional education. It also reduced times spent socializing, which reminds me of how isolated I had felt during the time.\n    \n    Headline: How COVID-19 Changed Everything From Learning To Living",

As a student in high school, I've noticed the declining trend in the time socializing with others as a major impact from the pandemic. Since returning from online school, students are increasingly less likely to interact with one another, especially as many students decide to turn to their phones in their free time as opposed to starting a conversation with others they're physically sitting around. Additionally, although the US scores on reading and math exams are only for 3rd-8th graders, my current high school teachers have mentioned the trend is also present in high school, especially evident in the grading of nationwide exams like AP exams that have begun making their rubrics slightly easier for students. The time online definitely set students back, and the education system is having to create new standards for students to adjust to their learning setbacks. I do wonder about the used car prices graph because there was an extremely steep incline all the way up to February 2022. Although prices have begun decreasing in recent years, I'm still confused as to why the prices shot up this much for used cars.",

Why do they go up and then back down again in the same year? It seems like it could be seasonal because of winters, but winter alone seems like not a good enough explanation for this. Something feels more off than just a seasonal flow for this amount of deaths being because of seasonal. Even more odd is that this spiking seemingly continues in a greater way in the post-COVID era. This relates to the community in that greater death rates obviously create more death, and therefore more sadness. This especially connects with me as I had a family member (albeit not necessarily a close family member), who died from COVID during the peak pandemic.

    "comment info": "Headline- The COVID Curveball: The Pandemic That Changed Everything\n    \n    What do you notice?\n    In these graphs, I notice major shifts beginning in March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic started. Unemployment claims spiked dramatically, while time spent socializing dropped. People began spending more on groceries and less at restaurants. Academic scores (especially in math) fell, likely because students had a harder time focusing during remote learning. Used car prices dipped in 2020 but then skyrocketed after 2021. Altogether, the graphs clearly show how the pandemic dramatically changed daily life for Americans\n    \n    What do you wonder? \n    What made some trends temporary (like haircut searches) and others more permanent (like online shopping)? How long will it take for student learning levels to fully recover, especially in math? It's been 5 years since COVID, and they still aren't near where they were pre-pandemic. Will car prices or grocery spending ever return to their pre-pandemic trends?\n    \n    How does this relate to you and your community?\n    This graph relates to my community because I experienced the pandemic and the changes it made to my life. As related to the graph, I socialized less with my friends, and as a result of online school, I felt like I learned much less. My parents, while still employed, shopped online much more and only ordered online groceries. They saw the changes in prices as well.",

Unemployment claims were also relatively low, but they skyrocketed in March 2020 at 6 million claims per week. The share of women in the workforce decreased, but gradually increased beyond its pre pandemic numbers. Online shopping saw a sharp increase after March 2020, and so did the price of used cars. People began socializing a lot less, (possibly as a byproduct of social distancing, as also seen with the increased web searches of \u201cHow to Cut Your Own Hair\u201d) and US Scores 3rd grade thru 8th declined. \n    \n    Questions - Beyond the initial shock, how has the pandemic changed daily life in the U.S? What long-term effects are we seeing (or will see) in education, the economy, and social behaviors? And most importantly, how do we measure recovery - by numbers or by well-being?\n    \n    Relation to Community - These trends hit close to home in NJ.

This showed me that the pandemic really affected human life in many ways. I also noticed that in general, after the pandemic began, data was more inconsistent. Naturally, data isn't always exactly gradual but in these graphs the data stays generally consistent. However, after COVID hit, things changed a lot from the original information but continued to change abruptly even after that. \n    2) I wonder how people who make these graphs can determine the information to put as data. Like, how do people know how many people are partaking in a survey or how calculating with averages, etc, can change how the graph looks? I just wonder how the whole process of creating graphs based on real life stays accurate. \n    3) This relates to me and my community because every focus for these graphs represents something that either directly happened to someone, or occurred around them that they saw. For me personally, I certainly noticed the used car prices when my family had to get a car, and I noticed that I began using online shopping much more often. \n    My headline would be \"How did COVID leave a lasting impact?\"",

The graphs paint a picture of a declining society, with a concerning statistic about reading and math levels in 3th - 8th graders being behind 0.2 - 0.4 years behind at most recent (2023). Luckily, those seem to be on the rise, and it will be very interesting to see if math and reading levels will be restored to at least the 2019 baseline in the future. \n    \n    2) What do you wonder?\n    I wonder why the share of women in the labor force went down during the pandemic, but then went back up following 2021. Were women disproportionately affected when job layoffs occurred during the pandemic?\n    \n    3) How does this relate to you and your community?\n    To put it plainly, I had to live through the pandemic.

This looks like on average it was happening in the middle of 2022.

For example, the restaurant prices as opposed to the grocery prices, as well as the US test scores being at a significant low for some time now. How long do people think it will be before US test scores return to what the 2019 baseline is? When looking at the graph representing time socializing with others, I am wondering what the units were that were being used for this. Was it on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis that they were being tracked? \n    \n    In connection with my community, many small businesses that closed can be seen when driving through Minneapolis.

From socializing to education to employment, the pandemic had an immediate and sweeping effect. US students in grades 3\u20138 saw test scores plummet in both math and reading, probably because of so many people switching to online learning.\n    \n    Additionally, millions more people almost immediately lost their jobs and claimed unemployment, and people started eating out much less often. I wonder what kind of effect that had on the American economy with so much less money circulating suddenly. I also wonder if the online shopping market would have risen so sharply if there had not been a pandemic, as our shopping has become increasingly digital even without the pandemic, and it looks like the trend was going upwards anyway. Finally, I wonder why some of the spikes in the graphs happen a decent time after COVID-19 hit and why the effects were delayed in some areas.\n    \n    This closely relates to me and my country because I had to attend school online in 2020 and personally experienced the global wave of social isolation the pandemic caused.

The pandemic created an environment that made society more comfortable with technology than directly interacting with another.

Academic performance has yet to fully recover, vehicle prices remain elevated, and most significantly, our levels of social interaction are still noticeably lower than before. There is no clear indication of when, or if, these trends will return to pre-pandemic norms.\n    2) What do you wonder?\n    What will society look like in twenty or thirty years? Will the decline in standardized testing outcomes lead to shortages in certain professions? Could this hinder technological and scientific progress?

Will these stem-related jobs be filled, or will the decrease in standardized testing prove fatal, resulting in gaps throughout our most innovative jobs?

I am very sorrowful for those who had to go through this, yet I am satisfied enough to see that millions of people have bounced back and got jobs within a year.\n    Transitioning on to the third, I am baffled and unaware until now about how many women are in our labor force as of today. I notice a positive trend showing how it is going to continue to keep going up. It makes me ponder how women got here in the first place.\n    On the fourth, I can extremely relate, I like to spend lots of money on food, but have never noticed how much each individual spends in comparison to groceries and restaurants. \n    With the fifth, we can notice an increased price in used cars due to the supply chain disruptions during the pandemic.\n    I can take part to the sixth, as almost everyone had to shop online because during the pandemic, no one could go outside.\n    Many people could interact with eachother during covid so they had to chat online\n    Many people didn't try during school in the pandemic, I personally only had 3 hours of school in 2020\n    8 cool",

This rapid change is from the COVID-19 pandemic, causing people to quarantine, resulting in lack of personal interaction. \n    I wonder if the spike in online shopping will only increase from 2020 and future years to come? Obviously not being allowed in person to different stores/shops, there was an increase in online shopping, so with this new activity normalized and often used, will this affect the activity of in person shopping? Since we all got so used to online shopping, it might be hard for business to gain a steady income again for in person sales due to the consistency we all endured from the Pandemic.\n    This connects to my community especially during times of COVID as we had to experience these changes from in person living lifestyles, but also from online and social media presence.
