    "comment info": "Interesting graph. By no means am I attempting to be biased towards a certain league, but how is it possible that the MLB and Minor League Baseball sell more tickets annually? After some time of thinking about this, I realized that it came down to how many games are in their seasons. Since Baseball seasons are MUCH longer, how accurate is this graph, really? If the NFL or NBA season was also 160+ games, I'd expect them to have much higher annual ticket sales. Especially the NFL, due to their stadiums being much larger and selling many more tickets on average per game. My point is this - this graph makes it seem as though professional baseball, even the minor leagues, is 2-3 times more popular than other major sports. At least that is what I first thought when I saw this. But, the facts are the facts, so it makes sense that ticket sales are increased when the amount of games in a season for that league is also increased.",

I\u2019ve always thought that playing sports is more fun than watching but sometimes it's fun to watch a sport with my dad or play a sports video game like mario super sluggers (it's just mario baseball) but just screaming about something stupid like donkey kong getting a home run and then rubbing it in my brothers face that i am so much better than him at the video game.  To go back on track about how baseball has a surprising amount of ticket sales, I think it's because people take their families to baseball and then it's only really dads that go to football games when you really think about it.",

NFL is at the bottom with less than 25 Million ticket sales, while MLB is at the very top, sometimes selling more than 75 million tickets. This graph shows the popularity of certain sports to Americans. One thing I wonder is if ticket pricing has any influence on sales.

Baseball is considered to be the \"most American\" sport, so it would make sense as to why it has the highest ticket sales, even with the minor league producing more than football and basketball. However, it is interesting to see that even though baseball surpasses the other sports, it fluctuates annually while minor league baseball, basketball, and football have a slight and steady increase. The increase for basketball and football sales may be due to an increasing interest and popularity in these sports. The sharp declines can be due to overpriced tickets, so people held back with purchasing them in a certain year.",

Do you think football and basketball would sell as many (or more) tickets as baseball if they had as many games?\n\nWhat do you think a catchy headline would be for this graph?",

The MLB has had the most fluctuation in sales since 1992, and the NFL has had the least change. Over time, the NFL has had steady and gradual growth, while the other three sports have had spikes in their sales. I wonder why MLB has had major changes while other sports had less change.

Football  although being \"America's favorite sport\" has lacked in ticket sales to other major league sports. I think the reason for this is because teams in the NFL like The New York Jets are so bad that they don't sell any tickets which would equate to the loss in NFL ticket sales.

I was shocked to see that you find football to be \u201cAmerica\u2019s favorite sport.\u201d Can you back that up with some data or sources? I\u2019d love to see them as my class argues over this idea often. Check back tomorrow for the link to the original article and what the journalist found, including some other measures of popularity of sports.\n\nIs the NFL the only league with a team that doesn\u2019t win often? I have been a fan of many lovable losers who still sell many tickets even in long droughts without a winning season in sight. Also, when you watch football on television, are there many empty seats? Is it really possible for the NFL to sell many more tickets?  \n\nI\u2019m also curious since you seem to be a football fan. Do you believe that if the NFL were to play more games (as you mentioned baseball does), would they enough people interested to buy tickets to many more games?",

Major league baseball ticket sales are significantly higher than any other  sport, including minor league baseball.

There are a few noticable dips in the ticket sales, especially for major league baseball and basketball. Major league baseball sales took a huge hit right after 1992, and basketball sales dropped after 1997 and in 2012. I wonder what caused those drops, and what casued minor league baseball sales to spike in around 2015.

The y-axis demonstrates the number of tickets sold in millions, with the highest amount sold in major league baseball. The overall trend of the graph is that more spectators have paid tickets to attend major league baseball games as opposed to minor league. Baseball is also the more popular sport to be seen live as demonstrated by it having the highest ticket sales. I also notice sharp declines in ticket sales involving major league baseball from around slightly after 1992 to 1996, as well as in national basketball games in around 1999 and 2012. Ticket sales reached their peak in 2007 for major league baseball and around 2015 for basketball. I wonder what may have caused these sharp peaks and troughs and why major league baseball is the most popular sport to attend? Maybe the economy of the different times has played a role with worse economy being paired to troughs and better economy being paired to peaks?

Going Once, Going Twice, and SOLD!\n\nI notice I noticed that in this graph, the MLB ticket sales are substantially higher than the ticket sales of the NBA and NFL. Baseball has definitely sold way more tickets than football and basketball. In addition, the highest sale on the whole graph is for baseball, which sold 55 million tickets in 1992. However, the number of tickets for MLB significantly dropped right after its peak in 1992. I also noticed that each sport went through certain dips in sales, but all have risen since 1992.\n\nI wonder is what the sales of each league would look like if they had the same number of games. The number of ticket sales per league is being compared, but they are on an unfair scale because each league having a different number of games. In addition, why was there such a large drop in ticket sales for the MLB in 1992-1996? I wonder why baseball sells so many more tickets compared to the NFL and NBA. A couple of reasons could be the number of games or the size of the arena.",

        "comment info": "@Turner Friday I appreciate your quest for more information. I do think you may have a good idea to look into how many games each league plays in a year to find some reasons why this graph looks this way, but I do disagree with labeling it unfair. Many times, there is more to the story inside of a graph, but it does not make it an unfair comparison. The number of games may be part of the story and possibly the prices of tickets as well. Can you think of other variables that may be included in the story of this graph? For instance, you pondered why there was not much variability in the number of ticket sales in the NFL over the years. Is there a reason the NFL can only sell so many tickets? Have there been events in the NFL such as strikes and lockouts that other leagues have needed to manage? Be sure to check back tomorrow to find the link to the original article to see what the journalist found, and keep seeking more information!",

I do want to caution you to be careful with the word \u201cexponential.\u201d Remember that word has a very specific meaning with numbers, and I\u2019m not sure that you meant that any of them were growing exponentially. \n\nYou had some great questions. That\u2019s a good insight about the number of games affecting the number of tickets sold. Do the different leagues play a different number of games than each other each year? How many MLB games are played? How many NBA games? How many NFL games? You may be onto something here. Use the actual numbers to back up your thought to not only answer your own question but also to inform others. Be sure to check back tomorrow to find the link to the original article. You may see that the journalist has some similar thoughts as you as well as some others.\n\nI\u2019m also curious about what you see when you say that each line is steady as well as increasing. I\u2019m not sure that I agree that all are \u201csteady\u201d. Which ones have more variability (change from year to year). I see that they all increase somewhat, but do some increase more than others?\n\nIs there a catchy headline you would use to draw more people in to looking at the graph?",
