The state of Florida has the highest number of banned books throughout the United States in 2023; meanwhile Alabama, Delaware, Connecticut, Alaska, Arizona, Montana, and Nevada have zero banned books from July - December 2023. I wonder what regulations and laws have been implemented in Florida that have led to the banning of 3,001 - 6,000 books.

It makes me wonder what kinds of books get banned and if there are specific laws for banning books. I also wonder if the state can just ban books or if the people get to vote on wether a book gets banned or not. I wonder if any books that are considered significant in literature are banned in certain states, and if so, how it may affect the educations of the students in that state. It also made me wonder what books were banned in my state, so I looked it up and I saw that some of the books on the banned/challenged list in my state were books that my friends independently read in class this year.

With such a progressive movement of silencing and removing works from states, it's easy to get lost in knowing what is right or wrong. Are these books being banned because they are bad and hurting the minds of our youth or are they being banned to push an agenda? Should Americans be letting their children read books that fill their minds with wrong things? This graph shows Florida, having Texas close behind, banning the most books. On the other hand, states like Alaska, Hawaii, Arizona, Montana, Alabama, and Nevada have no books banned. Any book can be in any of the states, so that raises the worry of why books are banned in some places and not others. When viewing this topic from the American standpoint you can stand to reason the fight for our First Amendment: the Freedom of Speech. Americans must also push to fight to keep books that may be indoctrinating youths off the shelf. Americans should have raised concerns about this drastic variety of 0 books to 6,000 being banned, so go to a local library or school board meeting to voice your concerns. This choice by states can lead to either our youth's safety or the chance of a fight regarding the want to protect one's freedoms.

Second, I've noticed that Texas and Florida have a significantly large amount of books banned, Florida being the highest.

This relates to me and my community because this graph shows that there are around 1-10 books banned at the school district level in my area which indicates to me that my community has a larger range of books available to read.",

Most states are in the 10 to 300 range but these states are in the 3,000 to 6,000 range which is a lot. This has much to do with their population community and school system choices. I wonder what types of books are being banned. And why do Texas and Florida have the most banned books, if it was just because of the population then California should also be up there with a lot being banned.

Why are there states banning so many books now? There was a huge jump in the number of books that were banned from 2022 to 2023 (about 9,000 or more). But what could be the cause of this? Could it be historical, political, or maybe even cultural reasons why Texas and Florida have banned so many while other states like Nevada haven\u2019t banned any?

I noted that Texas and Florida had the highest number of banned books, in contrast to states with zero banned books, such as Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico, Montana, and Alabama. This struck me as odd since a few states are in similar areas, so it\u2019s not necessarily a contrast in location. The majority of states, however, have less than 500 banned books, which is still a lot, considering how much effort and time is put into writing a novel. This makes me wonder what content has to be in a book for it to get banned? How is it decided that documented literature can be taken away from new generations? In my freshman year, we read To Kill A Mockingbird, which is seen as controversial due to its racist language and themes. After reading this book, I felt educated on what that time period was like. It gave me and my classmates a new perspective on how people were treated then. This grasp on a previous period in human history enlightened me and showed me how different we are as a society today.

The two biggest states with the most bans are Texas and Florida which are both southern states that are very populous which could have some meaning as to why the books are heavily banned. As you look across the states, no noticeable pattern occurs and it seems scattered into many states that have no connections in almost any way. This is shown as a state like Pennsylvania has a large amount of heavily banned books, but every single neighboring state is not as bad: this is shown in the other heavily banned states like Wisconsin, Texas, and Florida all have little to no banned books in surrounding states. It makes you wonder why these states specifically are very \u201csensitive\u201d or find the books offensive and inappropriate. I think the reason could range from generally just the political party and the decision makers of the state to possibly history or the culture or \u201ctype of people\u201d in the state.

It seems as though the vast majority of states fall under the \u201c1-10\u201d and \u201c11-100\u201d banned books categories. However, the only states with at least 1,001 banned books are Texas and Florida. This makes me wonder: is there a correlation between the number of banned books in a state and their political views? Which district officials, and particularly how many, are responsible for banning books? Do they accurately represent the voices of stakeholders, including teachers and parents? If not, this could demonstrate oligarchical corruption in our democratically driven communities. And perhaps most obviously, is the practice of banning books generally effective in protecting the education of students? If not, we must evaluate to what extent book banning negatively affects education. Because I personally believe book banning is a negative practice, I would name the graph \u201cBook Banning: Dangerously Restrictive Education.\u201d",

And if you look at the rest of the graph it is hard to find a discernible pattern for books banned and states that align in the same group. In my personal opinion I don't think that books are any form of media should be censored to audiences unless outright vulgar or inappropriate. Books like Of Mice and Men and To Kill a Mockingbird have been banned due to the controversy surrounding them. The main idea is that the ideals told in the books are too much for children to handle and children should not read them. I think a similar thing is going on in the states like Texas and Florida but the definition of \u201cinappropriate\u201d or \u201ctoo much to handle\u201d can vary from place to place, And that is why we see a graph with almost no recognizable patterns.",

I wonder why there are only such a few states that have not banned books and how other states like Florida and Texas have banned upwards of 1,000 to 3,000 books and why they have banned so many books while other states have only banned lower numbers of books or even none. I also wonder why it is that larger, more populous states like Texas and Florida ban so many books in their schools and is there a correlation between how large the population of that state is and how many books they ban? This relates to my community because my local library chooses to not display books covering sensitive topics such as religion, and violence and other sensitive topics.

It is interesting that some states, such as Florida and Texas are in the dark red, indicating a high amount of banned literature, while some states have banned 0 books during this period. The dark red indicates numbers of over 3,000 books being banned in just a few months. This is very shocking and makes you wonder what qualities these works retain that creates so much controversy to the point where it needs to be completely censored from the public. I wonder if the content of these banned books is directly based on the political opinions of the state. Is it really ethical to ban books if our first amendment right\u2013protecting our freedom of speech\u2013is prevalent, perhaps today more than ever? This connects to my community personally because I think reading classic literature is very important, however, classic works that we have read in previous years at school are being challenged as being of controversial nature. These works include Of Mice and Men, and To Kill a Mockingjay, which both portray important themes about our society  that cannot simply be overlooked because they contain sensitive topics. I think it is important to not shield important messages from children in schools due to controversy because controversy in our world and country is unavoidable. \u201cShould Literature be Censored in America?\u201d",

    "comment info": "After analyzing the graph I noticed that this data is from July to December 2023 and depicts the number of banned books per state. Florida has the highest number of books banned from around 3,0001 to 6,000 and Texas is close behind with 1,001 to 3,000. States like Arizona, Nevada, Montana, Alabama, and Hawaii have around zero. The graph depicts that typically Southeastern states seem to have more states that banned over 1 to 10 books and Northwestern states typically have a lower average. By looking at this graph it makes me wonder why books are banned and who decided what to ban. This makes me curious as to whether there are similar topics discussed in most banned books. Do different states' politics influence what books can and can't be outlawed? For example, are majority-ruled Republican states less likely to have prohibited books or the other way around? Is the government trying to hide to Americans certain subjects discussed in books and if so why? In my freshman honors English class, we read two books that are often banned in the US: To Kill a Mockingbird and Of Mice and Men. Both books described the hardships faced at that time and allowed me to gain perspective on these periods. Without the books, it would be hard to understand certain points the author made stand out about racism, sexism, and other sensitive subjects. However, sometimes the author of the book can be seen as insensitive and can personally hurt certain individuals views.",

I wonder what the constraints are of banned books are and what steps are taken to get a book banned in the state and why a book would even be bad enough to ban when you have the choice to read a book in the first place. This connects to me because I know that I have read banned books before within the state of Colorado, so what does it mean when a book is \u201cbanned\u201d if students still have access to it. Not only this, but this connects to my community because how are books banned in schools supposed to be segregated from non-banned books in the community library because you can access them through your local library and then bring them on campus without ever knowing that book was banned. It also sparks the thought that many teachers or even administrators don\u2019t know the list of banned books by memory, so how are they supposed to enforce it?

In contrast, states such as Nevada and Arizona contain absolutely no banned books. I wonder why this may be? Is it because the state of Texas has different views and opinions than the state of Arizona? I am from Texas and seeing how we contain the second most banned books concerns me on why we are so censored. In my sophomore year of high school, we were assigned a banned book project where we were able to read and research banned books. We were able to do this project on specific books because they weren't banned in our school but they were in others. This project is on the verge of being terminated due to the fact that most of these books will no longer be allowed in our library. I believe we should be able to read what we choose and we should not be censored to the stories and ideas of creative authors but the state of Texas and many other states believe otherwise.

Secondly, I noticed that there were a couple of states that have not banned any books whatsoever. This surprised me since I thought there were at least a couple of books banned in all states. Since Texas and Florida have the most books banned in the U.S., I wonder what specific books they are banning and for what reasons. I also wonder how many books in total America has banned. This graph relates to me because I am, somewhat, a strong believer in the idea that books should not be banned, however, there could be exceptions. Additionally, this also relates to my community since I live in Texas and am not shocked that they have banned a lot of books. Even though I understand that certain books might not be appropriate for certain ages or that certain topics just should not be brought up at school, nevertheless, I believe that these books should simply be kept out of the school or not be read instead of banning them.

I wonder if the conservative majority in these two states and other southern states correlates to the amount of books being banned. This relates to me and my community because Colorado holds a liberal majority with two democratic senators and books being banned is not a common occurrence locally. This makes me wonder if the banning of books has more to do with county legislation or state legislation and who should hold the final say. Since only 1-10 books have been banned in Colorado, it does not impact me as much as it would impact a student living in Florida or Texas. \n    Headline: Banning books: a state or county issue?",

The darker the color, the more banned books that state has. The first thing I noticed is the two states tha5 has the most banned book is Florida and Texas. Both of these states happen to be more conservative/ republican states. Also, very democratic sates like New Jersey has the grey color meaning little to no banned books. A possible conclusion is that more conservative states are banning more books while democratic states aren't. I wonder how this conclusion applies to swing states. Does it just depend on that state's choice? This affects my community by my community having a broader selection of books displayed in school giving different influences than different places. A name for this graph could be \"How many books is your state banning: the amount of books banned in each state mapped out.\"",

Taking mind that this is from 2023, I believe the number has just increased. I also noticed that out of all 50 states in the U.S., only 8 have no books banned.  This leads me to wonder what the logic behind these bannings is. I also wonder if this violates the 1st amendment since it's banning someone else's words. This relates to me and my community because in my school, we read \"To Kill  A Mockingbird\" which is banned in some states. A catchy headline could be \"The Busted Banned Books of United States\"",

Especially with this day and age when information is restricted from education on a early age it may affect what a student learns and is expose to until they leave their little bubble.",

In the past few years, book bans have been a very hot topic, leading to heated discourse about where or if a line should be drawn regarding the content of a book. I noticed that notoriously blue states have little to no banned books. On the other hand, notoriously red states, specifically Texas and Florida, have over one thousand books banned. I wonder why the range of banned books is so vast in Florida and Texas. It seems like it would be easier to simply have more precise data. I also wonder if this graph includes books that are challenged in certain areas. This relates to my community because, as a high school student, I like to be aware of the books that are restricted in my area and others. \n    Headline: Banning books throughout the country.",

Seeing this graph made me question, if this was the public number of banned books in each state of the US, what was the exact number of banned books including the ones banned without public notice? Would the numbers increase? Would there be darkers shades of red in some states? Thinking about how I live in Texas, one of the states with a darker shade of red, I can conclue that with about 1001-3000 banned books, sometimes our education revolving around literature can be more limited than those states with 1-10 banned books.

The amount of books that have been banned varies a lot from state to state but the most popular ranges are from 1-100. I wonder why some sites haven't banned any books when it seems to be the norm right now and why some others have banned thousands of books. I want to know why some states took so drastically to the banned book movement and some so little. This relates to my community because I live in a state with 1-10 banned books.

I understand people not wanting their younger kids to have access to these books, but there are many ways to prevent that. As a parent when taking your child to a public library you can easily guide your kids to books for their age. For kids in high school, librarians or teachers can restrict certain books for certain grades that can handle it better. No book should be banned because many of these books can teach kids good and valuable lessons in life or even be something that they can relate to. The authors of these books wrote the content inside for a reason and deserve the chance to have their books read all over by many students.",

I noticed that the darker the color, the more books are banned within the state. Furthermore, both Texas and Florida have the most banned books sitting between 1,001-3,000 and 3,001-6,000 books. \n    I wonder, since I previously mentioned the data was from 2023, how the graph would look like for 2024. Would there me any drastic changes? The note says that it does not include banned books by public libraries- what would this graph look like? What is the purpose of banning a book in school if a child can access it outside of it? Doesn't the concept of banning books violate the author's First Amendment rights?\n    This relates to me and my community because I'm a high school student in a state that has 1-10 banned books, though I am grateful it isn't more. Banning books restricts people from being exposed to new things and ideas, especially in a time that is so important for developing their own thoughts and opinions. Not only this, but many books I have both read and loved, in school and out, currently are on a banned book list whether it be in my state or another's.  \n    Title: \"Silenced Pages, Lost in Politics: Banned Books in the States\"",

Florida stands out with between 3,001 and 6,000 books banned represented in a dark maroon red, while states like Arizona have no banned books at all, marked in grey. Pennsylvania falls somewhere in the middle with 501 to 1,000 books banned. This suggests that while book bans aren't happening everywhere, they are particularly concentrated in states like Florida and Texas. This makes me wonder: why are Florida and Texas leading the way in banning books, and what specific criteria are being used to determine which books should be removed? How do these bans affect students\u2019 access to diverse perspectives and the freedom to think critically? I also wonder how these book bans impact educators\u2014are they being forced to limit their teaching materials or self-censor? In my own state, there have been only 1 to 10 banned books, which feels relatively low, but it still makes me think about the impact of censorship on access to knowledge. This issue also resonates with me because I recently wrote an essay on political courage, focusing on Congressman Jamie Raskin, who has actively opposed book bans. His argument that banning books attacks First Amendment rights and harms democracy deeply connects to the current situation. In fact, Raskin\u2019s own book was banned in Texas, so I\u2019ve been aware of this issue for some time.\n    \n    Headline: \"Book Bans Surge Nationwide, with Florida and Texas Leading the Charge\"",

I saw that the number of books banned is mostly over 100. There are many things I wonder about when I look at this graph, one being the types of books that are banned. What causes a book to be banned? Is there a more \"bannable\" genre? Are books like allegory, satire, or non-fiction novels (The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins or 1984 by George Orwell) more likely to be banned than other books? What is the purpose of withholding literature from children when they can access and read outside of school and public libraries? Is banning books an infringement of the author's First Amendment right? This impacts my community and me because restricting books can impair the public's access to literature. I am lucky to live in a state where the number of banned books is 1-10 and not over 100. I love so many books that I love, and many are currently on a banned list in other states. \n    Title: The Censorship Chronicles: Banned books per state!",

Not much research is required to quickly determine that this is because these states in particular have a habit of restricting education, especially education relating to diversity (such as LGBTQ+ identities or cultural diversity).\n         Some things that this makes me wonder are what kind of books are banned in the smaller states outside of the midwest, and what kind of books are bad enough to be able to be banned in the states with only 1-10 banned books? It's a pretty exclusive club for those states, and I wonder the prerequisites to get in.\n         While brainstorming headlines, I came up with \"countless books banned throughout U.S.; children's education falters.\" While it's a little dramatic, it describes the situation decently. And as all good journalists know, sensationalizing it will make people read it.\n         I live in Vermont, so I did some research about the books banned in Vermont. It's one of those states that has very few books banned in it. I couldn't find any sources that told me which books were banned exactly, but knowing Vermont, I believe they're books that are especially against equity or diversity, and/or directly promote violence against these groups, though that's a guess.",

Perhaps the older traditionalists living in Florida are responsible for the book bans.\n    - Michigan is just about in the middle of the book banning frequencies chart. Not too shabby, although I'd prefer it if we made like Nevada and banned book bans.

How does this relate to you and your community?\n    \n    This connects to my community since I live in a state with up to 10 banned books.

Have you ever asked the librarian for one of these books?  \n    \n    If a book is banned in your library, go to \u201cBooks Unbanned.\u201d  There, you can read about getting the ebook through the Brooklyn Public Library and other public libraries.",

I also noticed that Alaska, Hawaii, Delaware, Connecticut, Alabama, Nevada, Arizona, and Montana all have 0 banned books. \n    \n    -After looking at the graph, I wonder why some states have as little as zero banned books while other states have as many as 6,000 banned books. I also wonder why the books aren't being banned on a government level if some areas feel that strongly about preventing them from being read. \n    \n    -This relates to me and my community because I live in New York where 11-100 books are banned. This affects me because it should be my decision what I decide to read, not my government or school district, and when that right is taken away, I should be educated so I can do something about it. Additionally, my community is affected because New York has a significant number of books banned for a state with such a high population in an area where many people feel strongly about our rights. \n    \n    -A catchy headline for this graph could be \"Bye Bye Books.\"",

What specifically made these states more restrictive with their books? What common themes and ideas are most banned for individual books? Florida and Texas are the two states that have most books banned. I did not know of this before reading this research essay and now I know New York as well has books banned.",

From this graph, I wonder if there is a certain party of government that is prominent in states like Texas and Florida, possibly a conservative one, and how that party differs in Arizona, Montana, and Nevada.  It truly makes me wonder if the government is trying to push censorship on certain topics in schools. This graph relates to my community because there is a notable amount of books banned in New York. Although New York's numbers are significantly less than Florida and Texas, it is concerning to view a state that is typically known for being progressive, as one that is trying to hide information from students.\n    Catchy Title: Are writers being censored?",
