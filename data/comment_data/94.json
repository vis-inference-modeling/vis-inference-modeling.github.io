I also noticed while looking at the graph that the more income one makes, the less the percentage of smoking is. \n2. I wonder as to why people with less income smoke more than those with higher incomes. I wonder this because if they have less income, wouldn\u2019t they want to spend it more on things they need like food, water and their house? It makes me wonder if those of less income smoke more than those of higher incomes because of stress.\n3. It can affect how kids might tend to be since adults with lower income smoke (being of a role model). Will the kids smoke if they also have a low income?\n4. What is going on in the graph is that the graph is showing the percentage of people who smoke everyday or sometimes based on the amount of income they make. The graph shows that people of lesser income smoke more than those of higher income.

I also noticed that the graph measures household income, not just personal income.\n2. I wonder what the exact amount of participants there were that were surveyed, and whether or not it shows an accurate representation of the entire population, not just the sample. I also wonder what method they used for sampling, for example did they use stratified sampling, cluster sampling, or simple random sampling. I also wonder why people with lower income tend to smoke more even though they can likely not afford as much smoking materials as opposed to higher income households.\n3. The impact this has on the community is that most people with lower income will tend to have worse health since not only can they not afford as many essential supplies, but they are now spending more money on smoking and other substances that damage their bodies further. This could also have an impact because there would be an increased amount of deaths in the community, especially in essential workers in the lower income households, which could have an impact on the amount of essential workers there are in out society, affecting people of all incomes and backgrounds.\n4.

We can infer that, because lower-income households are generally more likely to smoke than higher-income households, that lower-income households will also be exposed to much higher levels of smoking deaths. As stated, in the first paragraph, \u201cCigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the United States.\u201d By the same token, the opposite would be true as well - higher-income households tend to have fewer chronic smokers, along with lower numbers of deaths attributable to cigarette smoking. It is also important to note that cigarettes typically contain nicotine, which is an addictive substance. This can add to even higher costs that lower-income households are more likely to face.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?

There is a pattern of: the greater the income, the less smokers.\n- What do you wonder?\n          Why exactly does smoking have such a great affect on smokers every day lives? Is it smoking addiction? Is it smoking culture? Is it just the people who smoke? Is smoking affect someone mentally? What is the difference between the low income smokers and the big income smokers? Does \"smoking\" include cigarettes, cigars and hookah? How many people who have an income substantially greater than 100 thousand dollars smoke?\n- What impact does this have on you and your community?\n          Well, I do not smoke and nor does any part of my intimate family. So, I would say that our family isn't affected by smoking. But there are some more low income communities in my area, who lean towards smoking. Smoking, just as proven by this data, can greatly, negatively affect you. So, it is very important to not smoke.\n- Catchy Hook Title: How smoking takes over your income.",

    "comment info": "What impact does this have on you and your community?\n        This graph would actually tend to provide valuable information on the impact of those that smoke regularly on various communities. We can infer that, because lower income households are generally more likely to smoke than higher income households, that lower income households will also be exposed to much higher levels of smoking deaths. As stated, in the first paragraph, \u201cCigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the United States.\u201d By the same token, the opposite would be true as well - higher income households tend to have less chronic smokers, along with lower numbers of deaths attributable to cigarette smoking. It is also important to note that cigarettes typically contain nicotine, which is an addictive substance. This can add to even higher costs that lower income households are more likely to face.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the  graph\u2019s main idea.\n        I would say that this graph is portraying the relationship between household income and the percentage of smokers that smoke \u201cevery day\u201d or \u201csome days.\u201d I would probably name this graph, \u201cThe Effect of Smoke on Money.\u201d",

I notice that people who make 35k are more likely to smoke while people who make 100k or more are less likely to smoke. \n\n2) I wonder if having less income impacts your mental heath which causes people to start smoking. I also wonder that if you have less income then you have more time to spend which people spend in smoking, while if you have a higher income you have more work, therefore having less time to smoke. \n\n3) This information makes me more aware of my surroundings and helps make me some assumptions. When I see someone smoking it would make me think that it would be more likely that, that person has a lower income.\n\n4) In the graph we just see the comparison of income with the probability of smoking.

What do you wonder?\nI wondered if these two variables\u2014smoking and income\u2014are even correlated in the first place. They don't seem to directly influence the other, so there might be some other variable that causes both of these to change.\n3. What impact does this have on you and your community?\nThe state I live in, Virginia, has a median household income of $74,222(US Census Virginia, 2019), which places it in the $35k-$75k range for smokers, with 15%. From this, I estimate that around 3 in 20 people in Virginia are smokers. Since I spend most of my time with my family or in school, this does not really impact me much, but will definitely impact my community, since smoking is not healthy for them. \n4. What\u2019s going on in this graph? \nThe Smoking Everyday\nIn the graph shown above, you can observe that 21% of those with less than $35k in household income have reported to have smoked. This percentage will decease to a 15% in the $35k-$75k range, down to 13% in the $75k-$100k range, and finally drop down to 7% in the >$100k range. It seems that the percentage of people who smoke undoubtedly decreases as the household income increases, but for what reason? If you earn more, are you more likely to not smoke? The data on this graph is quite strange, and it seems peculiar how these two variables\u2014smoking and income\u2014can even be related.",

But this cannot conclude that smoking causes people to have lower income. The graph does show that the higher the income the lower the percentage of smokers. This makes me wonder why people with low incomes feel the need to smoke and what keeps people with higher incomes to not smoke. It also makes me wonder if environment plays a big role in smokers, if wealthier backgrounds contribute to not smoking. Maybe people who have less than 35k income use smoking to cope with the stress. Even though me and my community has never had to face these challenges, I imagine it's very hard to live in a low income community where not only is the air being contaminated by smokers but it's a very unhealthy way of living. This graph mainly shows that the higher the income the less people smoke. It's left leaning and makes me wonder if smoking is related to wages.

A pack-a-day habit results in $188 per month or $2,292 per year. This is a substantial amount of money. \n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder why people who tend to make less money smoke more often. One theory is that people who make less have more financial problems in their lives and thus need a way to escape the stress. Nicotine, which is a sedative and a stimulant, allows people to escape briefly from reality and heightens their mood. People who make more money don't have as many stress factors which means they don't need to find ways to relax and escape. Another theory is that people who can't afford a better education like the one people with more money can get didn't receive much encouragement to not part take in drugs/smoking. However, this point is very subjective.\n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nThis doesn't have a strong impact on me or my community. However, it does worry me that people smoke because it leads to more deaths which is bad. In addition, in theory, the more people there are who smoke the higher the chances of teens wanting to fit in or teens who are pressured into smoking by smokers. \n\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph?

Conversely, the highest income category has the lowest rate. Given the high cost of cigarettes, this inverse relationship between income and smoking seems counterintuitive. We can't assume a cause-effect relationship from this observational study, but it's fair to say that other factors might be involved to explain it. I wonder where this seeming correlation between smoking and income comes from. In part, could it be inferior health education in poorer communities regarding the repercussions of tobacco? Could it also be strategic advertising by manufacturers to target the poor population? If this is the case, is it unethical and worth government intervention? Coming from a mostly upper-middle-class city, this graph doesn't have a direct impact on the vast majority of us. However, given that about a fourth of NH citizens make less than $35k/year, this information is important to all of us. Smoking has many horrific health consequences, but those with lower incomes often don\u2019t have health insurance. The health of our state\u2019s economy could be negatively impacted by smoking-related morbidity. It\u2019s important for us to be aware of the relationship between smoking and income as its cause may be unethical and preventable. The main idea of the graph is that there's an inverse relationship between smoking rates and annual income. Headline: \"Income and Smoking, Could They Be Related?\"",

Although most would assume that high income people would smoke more because they can afford to spend, but the graphical display shows that that is not in fact the case. In addition to this, it is also shown that people whose income is more than 100k smoke very much less more often than not. \n\nI wonder why smoking is still popular or even in question when it is well known that it is bad for you. I understand that a majority of the people who still smoke, especially in the U.S, are probably all people who have smoked for a long time and are now addicted.\n\n\nAs someone who lives in a predominately middle /upper class area, I don't think that this issue is as prevalent as the majority of those who do smoke here can afford it. However, the lower income/impoverished people in my town may be more likely to smoke or have smoked. This effects my community because of the immense damage can do to your health and overall well being. Smoking should be more regulated in public areas, especially in this time of safety and social distancing.\n\nThe main purpose of this graph is to show that people with a lower income are more likely to smoke than those with a higher income.",

The graph is right-skewed, with the highest percentage (21%) of smokers falling within the less than $35,000 household income bin and the lowest percentage (7%) of smokers falling within the over $100,000 bin.\nI wonder why individuals with lower incomes have the highest rate of smoking? I wonder if the inclusion of other drugs, such as prescription medicines, would change the levels of usage among different income levels? While the over $100,000 bin may have the lowest levels of smoking, I wonder if it would have higher levels of prescription drug use due to potential insurance coverage? Also, I wonder if each block is dominated by a certain age group? The lower income levels may be dominated by younger people while the higher income levels may consist of older people. \nMembers of my community that fall into lower income brackets may be more likely to smoke, which will most likely cause long-term health consequences. Since premature death and illness are caused by smoking, my community should focus on funding treatment options for people with addictions. These treatment options should be free to everyone to ensure that they are accessible to all income levels. \nThe smoking and income graph shows that individuals with lower household incomes are at higher risk of smoking than individuals with higher household incomes.\n\u201cIs Income a Predictor of Smoking Levels?\"",

The first thing I noticed when looking at the graph is that the highest percentage of smokers were grouped into the less than $35 thousand dollar annual revenue category. Along with that I noticed that as the annual income of people increased, the percentage of smokers decreased. I think this is interesting as the results of the graph show this trend to be very steady and consistent. From these findings, I am wondering if there are more smokers with smaller wages because money might be a problem for them. I know that many times people that smoke or are addicted to drugs originally started because they are going through a rough time in their life, and  felt they needed something to ease the pain. I wonder if the graph is showing the same thing, as more people are smoking to help them cope with possible money problems they are having.\n\tThe findings in this graph might also be able to explain why there aren\u2019t a ton of smokers all around our city. Our town is considered to be overall on the wealthier side, which would put us towards the middle of the graph shown. This would mean that we shouldn\u2019t have a particularly higher percentage of smokers living in town, and I believe that to be true from my experiences growing up.

This rate is 21% among households making under $35k a year, while among households making over $100k yearly it is three times smaller at 7%. Clearly, there is a connection between income level and smoking rates.\n2. I wonder what the graph would look like if additional bars were added for higher income groups (e.g. $100k-200k, $200k-300k, etc). I predict the percentage of smokers would continue to decrease following the right-skewed shape of the graph, creating a thin tail. Like many others, I am definitely curious about the cause of this connection as well. \n3. Smoking claims thousands of lives and is especially common among lower-income households, so we must do our best to help these members of our community. Increased anxiety and other mental health issues are common among poorer people, which may lead them to smoke more. It is important to provide the resources they need to quit smoking, and to improve their quality of life so that they won\u2019t start in the first place. By improving their health, we improve the collective health of the community. \n4. The graph graph demonstrates that there is a clear connection between yearly household income level and smoking rates. This could be for a variety of reasons, likely multiple ones combined.

In general: the lower the income category, the higher the rate of smoking.\n2) I wonder why this is the case. I don\u2019t think there is a cause-effect relationship here, and certainly this is not caused by some moral failing of the poor. Are sociological factors common to smokers also common to people having less income? Is it the fact that old, retired people are more likely to smoke and also more likely to be in the <$35 category?\nAlso, this graph only analyzes smoking, (tobacco, I presume). What about other drugs? Alcohol? Cannabis? Etc.\n3) I live in a relatively wealthy area, so for most people in my community this won\u2019t be that much of a problem. But we have to be conscious of the health concerns of EVERYONE in our community. Take COVID-19. It\u2019s a respiratory disease, so being a chronic smoker is not very good during these times. Lacking adequate health insurance or medical care is also not very good during a pandemic. Both of these problems are correlated to being low income, so we have to be cognizant of the fact that this disease will disproportionately affect the poor. And now people are making less money due to the economic devastation during the pandemic, exacerbating this problem.\n4) The main idea of this graph is that people in lower income categories are at a higher risk of smoking.

Approximately 21% of those who earn less than $35k annually, the lowest income bracket, smoke often, compared to 7% of those who earn over $100k annually, the highest income bracket. This graph suggests there is a relationship, whether causational or not, between household income and the percentage of smokers. As income increases, the percentage of smokers decreases. I wonder if this is true because smoking for many is used as a coping mechanism. Since those in lower-income brackets tend to deal with more stress related to finance, are the percentages of smokers higher for this reason? I also wonder what a map would look like which shows the states and their average income and percentage of smokers. I think this data would be interesting to see as it would allow us to compare data state-by-state as opposed to just generalized data. This information impacts my community as it shows those around me who earn less have a higher tendency to smoke and are therefore putting themselves at risk for many health issues. However, I am very fortunate to live in a wealthy part of the U.S., which means according to this graph not many people smoke. I would be able to back this up as I do not see many people in my community smoking. This graph shows income brackets and their corresponding percentage of smokers.

Or to just be social? The impact that it has on me is that the more lower class you go, the more people are dying from smoking, or even second hand smoking. A catchy headline would be \"What economic class smokes more cigarettes?\"",

Every time the salary goes up, the percentage of smokers goes down.\n\nWhat I wonder: I wonder why there is a higher percentage of smokers with lower salaries. Could it be due to them unable to pay for their needs and they see smoking as a way to relieve some of that stress? I also wonder if it is more older people smoking, or if it is the younger generation that tends to smoke more.\n\nImpact: This has a big impact on my community because there are some lower income neighborhoods around me. It is not uncommon for me to see someone smoking in those areas and it could be related to financial needs. The government should try and focus on helping families with lower incomes because it may end up decreasing the amount of smokers worldwide.\n\nHeadline: How Salaries Lead People to Smoking",

We say there is a correlation between two variables if both are quantitative.  Otherwise, we say that there is an association between any two variables, but in this case, for a quantitative variable (household income) and a categorical variable (smoking).\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about if having a lower household income CAUSES people to smoke.  Or, if alternatively, if smoking CAUSES one to have a lower household income.  Both of these are described here as cause-and-effect relationships.\nIn statistics, there can only be a cause-and-effect relationship if we perform an experiment.  We would need to randomly assign a large group of individuals to one of two groups: where all members of one group are assigned to smoke and all members of the other group are assigned to not to smoke.  We would collect income information from all members of each group for many years. Then we would compare the average income for each group. Given what we know about the harmfulness of smoking, such an experiment would be unethical. When an experiment cannot be conducted, we can use observational studies to learn about the relationship between variables like smoking and income.\n\nThe data represented in this graph comes from an observational study.  There is NO cause-and-effect, but rather an ASSOCIATION!",

On the other hand, if we were to look at household incomes with at least 100K, then 7% would say that they smoke. I wonder as to why exactly it is that we see these results. Could it be that the less income a household makes, the more likely it is for that house to be located in a poor community and therefore be influenced by street culture. I would say that this impacts my  community very greatly because I come from a background that makes nowhere near 100K a year, and there is already a culture of smoking that happens with the adults in my life. Although this may be true, I do have faith that smoking will die down in my generation because most kids my age are already aware as to the dangers of smoking. I hope to see this study done in the future with much less percentages -- no matter the household income. Catchy headline: \"Is There a Correlation Between Household Income and Smoking?\"",

What causes this culture of smoking?  How could the cycle of the culture be \u201cbroken?\u201d  You could find on the CDC website statistics on who smokes.  There, you may uncover strategies for reducing smoking. \n\n( Just a small note \u2013 in the second sentence, you probably don\u2019t mean \u201cabout 21% *more* smokers.\u201d)",

There is not as much change between the $35k-75k and $75k-100k range as there is from <$35k and $35k-$75k and from $75k-100k.\n\nI wonder what the divide is between the percent who smoke every day and those who only smoke some days. The difference could matter a lot if someone is looking at health concerns or the amount of money spent. I also wonder what exactly is being smoked. Is the graph talking about cigarettes, marijuana, both, etc? If so, knowing how many smoke every day versus only some days would probably become more important.\n\nThis impacts my community because smoking can affect more than just the person doing it. If we are concerned about health or providing support to people who need it, we need to know where and how to connect to them.\n\nTitle: \"Who's Lighting Up?\"",
