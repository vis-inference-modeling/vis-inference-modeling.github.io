    "comment info": "The first thing I noticed is that teenagers nowadays are getting a very minimal amount of sleep. Sleep is very important for peoples everyday functions and it hugely impacts their minds and bodies. I think the reason people today are getting less sleep is because of techknowledgy and distractions. I think teenagers focus on things that aren't important in life and it can make them feel worse later on after the damage is done. Getting minimal sleep, and doing things that aren't necessarily good for you can lead to poor mental health, which is another increase in the graph for teenagers today. I think it is all connected between bad habits we are making today. If we make a change and recognize what we are doing, I think these negatively affected areas can improve. It will take time but it would get better. \nI wonder if teenagers these days just applied themselves and tried to better themselves individually, how that would affect communities everywhere?\nI think a good headline is, \"Will Teenagers Be The Downfall of Society?\"",

These all go hand in hand with the impact of social media on mental health and isolation and less physical interaction among the youth population. these declines have differences between the two genders. so the impacts are not gender neutral but rather gender diverse. there could be many other reasons other than social media that are negatively impacting the rate of suicide. Other declining factors include smoking cigarettes which are in exchange with the recent increased vaping. less social interaction such as fewer rates of TV watching could have led to drinking less alcohol and a decline in the rate of sexual interaction. Overall, the rate of suicidal ideation is more felt among female population and that could be due to more vulnerability or exposure to bullying or societal or family pressure.  But I wonder why the female population is feeling this more and is affected more by the situations they face in their lives.",

Indeed it's very human to notice an association and want to believe it's causal, but it's crucial not to draw that conclusion! There are many other plausible reasons for the association, such as that some other underlying issue in the person's life (anxiety, stress) is causing both. Or that smoking has directly or indirectly caused the depression. It's also possible that it's a coincidental association. And of course the other big thinking error is to move from anecdotal observations (such as you observing people in your neighborhood) to generalizing to a larger population without data.

In addition, phone use and screen time have increased dramatically, as if electronics have filled the void left by the absence of drugs or alcohol. Additionally, besides vapes, the students' use of drugs has decreased while metal health has regressed.\n\n2.    What do you wonder?\n\n   In terms of the graph, I wonder how the data would differ or be distributed if it separated female responses form male responses. Is one gender more likely to exhibit a specific behavior or emotion? Also, referring back to the first question, I am curious if social media and technology\u00a0has\u00a0had an effect on the use of drugs, alcohol, and vapes.\n\n3.

Due to the pandemic and the need to maintain contact with others through virtual means, nearly all of our generation's high school students have become technologically dependent.

Use of marijuana is on the rise again (30%).\n I was surprised to notice the downward trend in sleeping and television watching, until I noted  the increase in electronic devices usage.  It may explain the decline in watching TV: everything is done on the phone, tablet, or other device, these days.\nTrends in the upper set of graphs seems more positive; the lower set of graphs presents a different picture: between 2009 and 2019, teens feeling sadness and hopelessness are on the rise, as are the number of those who seriously considered suicide, those who made a suicide plan, and those who attempted suicide.\nI wonder if there is a correlation between lack of traditional methods of \u201cescape\u201d (alcohol, tobacco) and the rise in feelings of negativity.  In other words, does it alleviate sadness if we imbibe nicotine and alcohol?  Or does the rise in marijuana use cause paranoid reactions that lead to the rise in feelings that lead some to consider and even attempt suicide?\nThis impacts my community because it is largely populated with teens whose behavior, beliefs, and states of mind may be reflected in the data shown in these graphs. It means that many of my students are not getting enough sleep, are persistently feeling hopeless or sad, and most troubling is the rise in considerations of suicide.\nA potential headline:  \u201cIs a Gram Better Than a Damn?\u201d.",

What about the increase in use of smartphones and other devices?  How do they relate to emotional well-being?\n\nThese statistics come from the federal CDC (see sources below the graphs), which carries out very extensive national surveys frequently.  They are reliable:  sample sizes are large and the questionnaire and survey methods are well-designed.  \n\nFrom your perspective in the UK, are behaviors different than the US?

I'm curious how these graphs would look if we arranged them like the bottom six with male/female charts.\n\n3: This relates to my community, because I find it disturbing that 12-20% of people have seriously considered suicide and made a plan. It does make me glad that the rates are going down(40% of high school girls have considered suicide... geez), although they are going up a little bit in terms of depression.
