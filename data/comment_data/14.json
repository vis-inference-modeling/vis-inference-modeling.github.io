I wonder if all the companies stock markets add up to $1,000,000,000,000.  I wonder if some of the big companies are taking over the smaller ones. Something that is going on in this graph is they are showing who dominates the stock market. All though there are definitely bigger companies like Amazon and Apple who have more money these companies are still big.",

Many of you wondered why some companies did not have stock market values. And did the colors mean anything?  You had some catchy headlines including TN of Chelsea\u2019s \u201cWhat Does a Trillion Mean?\u201d and Jane of Milwaukee\u2019s \u201cBusiness By the Billions.\u201d Good noticing and wondering leads to snappy headlines.\n\nThanks to all teachers and students who responded.

I wonder why these companies were specifically selected, and if the selection process attempted to put apple market shares  in perspective to other industries. If this is the case, it would be interesting to compare with other companies within the  tech industry (i.e   Alphabet, Microsoft, Netflix as suggested above) .  The story this graph is telling us is that Apple and Oranges aren't the same thing.",

The graph excludes companies that are under or over the billion dollar mark. I wonder why some companies have specific values to their squares and others don\u2019t. I also am surprised that companies such as McDonalds aren\u2019t included and Hershey\u2019s is. I wouldn\u2019t have thought Hershey\u2019s was more equitable. There also is a significant lack in entertainment companies. I\u2019d think with the increase in television and movie streaming that companies such as Netflix or Hulu would at least make the list. My catchy headline would be: \u201cBusiness by the Billions.\u201d",
