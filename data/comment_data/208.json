Only 12 species are in the 75+ to 100+ and there are more than 50 types of Butterflies in the -100 to -75 range. Each year we lose 1.3% of Butterflies in the US so in 20 years if the rate stays the same we will have lost 26% of the butterflies population. Which means we will have 26% less butterflies pollination in 20 years.  This will cause problems going into the future. If the population of earth rises which it probably will in 20 years and there is 26% less pollination on crops, flowers and other oxygen giving plants there will be smaller harvests and less Oxygen which will cause even more problems. So we should try and make good efforts to raise butterfly populations and use more sustainable practices. So we should get off our computers and go outside and grow gardens and flowers, use less energy from the power plant and help bring more butterflies to our communities across the United States.",

    "comment info": "My takeaway from the following graph is that there are more butterflies in the larger quantity. My wonder for the following graph is how the butterflies decreased in quantity from 2000 to 2000. Did they have an illness impacting their population? Was there a large demand for butterflies? Was there a hunting population among predators? Was there scientific research going on in the lab? Was there climate change impacting their habitat? Some people might have answers to the stated questions. How would this relate to the people is that, due to the nature of the butterflies, maybe because of the increase of butterflies being taken away from their natural habitats and into butterfly sanctuaries internationally. Some may attribute it to the impact of climate change globally, due to the warmer temperatures from 2000 to 2020. Finally, a good memorable headline would be \"See how the butterfly abundance shifts throughout 2000 and 2020.\"\n    The reason this is memorable is that the reader will see the following headline and have a curious mind about how the abundance of butterflies shifted throughout history. \n    In conclusion, I think this is my wonder, thoughts, and impact on the community.",

In contrast, only a small number of species have seen an increase, and only a handful have seen a 100% or more increase.  Is habitat loss, pesticides, or climate change to blame for the problems of so many species?  I wonder whether the growing species are invasive or simply more suited to human habitats.  Since butterflies are pollinators, their extinction could have negative effects on ecosystems, plants, and agriculture.  Additionally, it serves as a reminder that local communities may lose not just a valuable species but also the aesthetic appeal and cultural significance that butterflies hold. \n    \n    A catchy title for this graph could be: Vanishing Wings: Most Butterflies Are Disappearing Fast",

One observation is that each dot in the graph represents a different Butterfly species. Another observation is colored dots on the left are red while the colored dots on the right are green. The green shows an increase in population and the red shows a decrease in population. The graph also has percentages on the top. in the graph on both sides it shows 100%. For the dots on the left the 100% means a 100% decrease in population and therefore extinction. the 100% for the dots on the right means a 100% increase in population. There is also a lot of dots in the middle with no color which means that those specific species have not experienced any significant change in population. \n    \n    What Do You Wonder?\n    There are many questions that could be asked about this graph. I wonder why there are so many Butterfly species have lost their population. I wonder if this is due to human mistakes. I also wonder if there is something that we can do to help. \n    \n    How Does It Relate To You And Your Community?\n    This graph relates to my community because besides Bees, Butterflies are also natural pollinators. Without them, my community can suffer from less pollination and plant and flower growth. As well as that, Butterflies are a food source. Without them, animals like birds in my community could starve as a result.\n    \n    Catchy Headline\n    Fluttering Away: Just What is Happening to Butterflies?",

There are many more species of butterflies losing population and going extinct rather than gaining population. The closer you are to the -100% mark, the closer you are to extinction.

Is it due to environmental factors like global warming, loss of habitat, or loss of resources? Is it because of an a priori factor like a mutation or an increase in predator presence? Are the select few species that are in a rapid increase infringing on the survival rates of weaker species?\n    \n    This relates to me and my community because it is highly indicative of a harmful factor in the environment. Whether an invasive species or failure to survive due to loss of habitat, the loss and potential extinction of so many species in the environment is a massive concern for everyone. The loss of one species can alter and disrupt an entire food chain. \n    \n    Possible title: \"The Butterfly Effect\"",

The closer to this percent the lesser the amount of butterflies in each specific species. As well as orange dots there are also a few green dots. These green dots show the species that populations grew. As they approached 100%, these species grew the most. Each dot represents a new species so I think this graph is trying to show us the drastic butterfly species decline.\n    \n    There are many things in this graph that confuse me. I wonder what the specific species are and which ones declined. I also wonder how long it took for each species to decline. Was this process fast or throughout the whole 20 years?\n    \n    I can relate this information from the graph to my community. Maybe there were certain factors, like pollution,  that contributed to the decrease in butterfly species. Maybe these declines could have been prevented if everyone took care of the planet. This is a good wake up call because everything has a consequence and pollution may have caused  the extinction of many beautiful butterfly species.\n    \n    Catchy Headline: Butterfly decline?

This scenario could be illustrated with a diagram demonstrating survival of the fittest in a specific region. \n     Butterflies are a vital part of the ecosystem, so it is crucial to learn the causes of this shrinking population to avoid further decline.

The left hand side of the graph (shows negative change), where it is mainly crowded with orange and red dots.

Seeing the butterflies grow and then releasing them into the wild was always such a fun experience and it is one of the things that made my family and I come together to truly enjoy watching nature and seeing the beauty in things that many people overlook.

More specifically, I see a large number of statistically significant negative changes. This is very concerning, as butterflies are an integral part of our ecosystem, without them, we will be in big trouble.\n    2. I have some curiosities regarding the graph choices and the story the data presents. To be completely honest, it took me a little time to figure out what the graph was showing and what everything meant. I don\u2019t have a perfect solution, and I eventually understood its message, but as a statistician, I know data visualization needs to be clear. You can\u2019t assume the viewer will interpret it the same way you do without some guidance. For example, a key for the color gradient could be helpful since it is not explicitly explained, and the color choice is not color-blind friendly. As for the story of the data, I am concerned. Such significant species declines are alarming, no matter the species. My initial assumption is that global warming and harmful agricultural practices are the primary causes.\n    3. This data relates to my life because it could be some of my own actions that contribute to this change. While some progress has been made toward a \u201cgreener\u201d world, clearly, there is much more work to be done.

Sure, 75% sounds huge, but in a tiny population it\u2019s not actually that many. A small change\u2014like a few butterflies coming or going\u2014could just be random chance.\n    That\u2019s why scientists don\u2019t rely only on how big the change looks. When they call something \u201cstatistically significant,\u201d they\u2019re also asking: How confident are we that this change is real and not just random noise?",
