It does a great job of visually emphasizing the disparity in temperature trends, drawing attention to the faster warming of nights. This pattern likely points to urbanization and the heat island effect as key contributors. However, the graph could benefit from additional context, such as annotations on population growth or comparative data from similar cities, to deepen understanding of the underlying causes. Despite this, the clear presentation of data trends makes it a strong tool for sparking conversation about the urgent need for sustainable urban planning and climate resilience.",

Whenever there was a bit of a dip in the temperature, there was lower solar activity. Whenever there was a high in solar activity, the temperature was higher. Another thing that I noticed was the sun is going through a little stage where it is burning out a lot of energy, causing more solar flares than usual. That is why there are so many more counts of northern lights, not so far in the north at more unusual times as well. This activity is going to peak in the summer of 2025, and then cool off according to studies done in San Diego State University.

What stands out to me from the graph is the range of temperature being very large, from 70 to 100 in a single year not really fluctuate much, until 2000 where the range decreased by half, decreasing the lowest temperature and the highest remaining stable. One possible reason for this, could be climate change and global warming affecting the coolest temperature and warmest as well.\n\n2. This graph sparks curiosity to be regarding how the graph look or what trends were prior to 1960, and how they will continue past 2020(the confines shown on the graph). Another question I had, was why as the years progressed, the range didn\u2019t increase, decreasing the lowest temperature and increasing the max temperature when the explainable reason for trends is climate change. In climate change, we know that drastic changes are what occurs, with overall harsher winters, which dint evident in the graph.\n3. This graph can be related to my life and community in prompting me to evaluate climate changes in my own community, made possible through my understanding of this graph.

Whenever there was a bit of a dip in the temperature, there was lower solar activity. Whenever there was a high in solar activity, the temperature was higher. Another thing that I noticed was the sun is going through a little stage where it is burning out a lot of energy, causing more solar flares than usual. That is why there are so many more counts of northern lights, not so far in the north at more unusual times as well. This activity is going to peak in the summer of 2025, and then cool off according to studies done in San Diego State University.

The day subgraph shows a lot of noise, still on the graphs it is written that the temperature has slightly increased. At the same time the night subgraph shows clearly the increase of the average temperature.\nThe biggest question I have is the temperature sub graphs in agreement: one is increasing much faster than the other. In theory they should show similar patterns. The cause of this different behavior is concerning.\nAdditional question is on the first glance insignificant day temperature growth, what was it caused and what is its effect on the environment and our lives.\nThe graphs show the general increase in temperature, for my and any community this should be concerning, because this might be not a natural process, rather human interaction with nature brings to this consequence. Reducing destruction environment must be the priority question, to prevent further sufficient climate changes \n\nConcerning night temperature increase.",

The nightly increase is an unnatural increase in heat, and therefore dangerous to all communities and not just Las Vegas. Addressing and taking action against climate change is and should be our top priority as a global community. However, the global action against climate change isn't likely, so what actions do you think individual people should take?",

What stands out to me from the graph is the range of temperature being very large, from 70 to 100 in a single year not really fluctuate much, until 2000 where the range decreased by half, decreasing the lowest temperature and the highest remaining stable. One possible reason for this, could be climate change and global warming affecting the coolest temperature and warmest as well.\n\n2. This graph sparks curiosity to be regarding how the graph look or what trends were prior to 1960, and how they will continue past 2020(the confines shown on the graph). Another question I had, was why as the years progressed, the range didn\u2019t increase, decreasing the lowest temperature and increasing the max temperature when the explainable reason for trends is climate change. In climate change, we know that drastic changes are what occurs, with overall harsher winters, which dint evident in the graph.\n3.

The daily highs have increased by two degrees fahrenheit, and the overnight lows have increased by eleven degrees fahrenheit.  I noticed that the red represents the daytime temperatures and the purple represents the nighttime temperatures.  I wonder why the difference in temperature between the day and nighttime was so great, being nine degrees.  Because Las Vegas is a major city and is largely populated, the use of pollutants, air pollution, amongst other types of pollution, is most definitely an issue.  Looking at the ragged edges of the top and bottom of the data, I am wondering why the increase is so inconsistent.  Maybe this represents the years where the pollution wasn't that bad compared to years where the pollution especially affected the warming of Las Vegas.  This is specifically seen surrounding and including the year 1980, where the temperature dropped well under 100 degrees compared to other years where the heat spiked.  This relates to me and my community because of the increase of global warming not only where I live, but worldwide.

The nighttime temperatures have continued to rise over the years while temps during the day have had very little change. In the graph, I noticed that in between 1960 and 1980, there was a huge drop in the temperatures at night, but since then the temperatures have only gone up. What caused this big drop, and why hasn't there been another significant one since? I theorize that climate change and an increase in factories(greenhouse gasses) may play a part in this increase, and that is what heavily impacts me and my community.

There are two key temperature trends: daily highs (in red) and overnight lows (in purple). Daily highs have increased by about +2\u00b0F, while overnight lows have increased significantly more over the years compared to the highs.\nThe graph covers a period from around the 1950s to the 2020s.\n\nWhat do I wonder? \nWhat factors are causing the sharp increase in overnight lows? Is this happening in other regions? Global warming may be a factor in these increases, but why are overnight lows increasing so much more than the daily highs? \n\nWhat do I think is going on in this graph?\nI think the graph shows that Las Vegas is getting warmer over time. Daytime temperatures are going up a little, but nighttime temperatures are rising much more. This might be due to climate change and the city's growth, making it harder for the area to cool down at night. Summertime heat is growing more intense. \n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThe graph is  a reminder that rising temperatures could become a reality in my community. Even though my community might not be in a desert, similar shifts in temperature could happen everywhere.

The temperature seems to fluctuate quite a lot throughout the years. This has to do with the overall weather of that year and how much pollution contaminated the air. I wonder what specifically is causing the temp rise. My guess is pollution that has made it hotter overtime. New technologies that were made over the years could be causing more pollution that is piking the temperature. The graph is really demonstrating global warming and the effects it has on certain areas. The rises concern in my community because it will be interesting to see how much we have been affected by the same type of problems that made Las Vegas hotter.

As the city has grown, more buildings, roads, and other infrastructure have been constructed. This means that urban areas tend to be warmer than their rural surroundings. There may be other factors, such as an increase in greenhouse gases due to human activity like burning fossil fuels. I wonder how the daily and overnight temperatures in Las Vegas have changed since 1950. Also, how do the temperatures compare between different seasons?

    "comment info": "The first thing I noticed while analyzing the graph that in the year 2000 to 2020, the daily highs bar stays consistently over the 100\u00b0F even when it seemingly drops. Whereas, everything before the year 2000, though it does hit over 100\u00b0F, it is not consistent and when it drops it goes below 100\u00b0F. The overnight lows, I notice, begin to increase in the temperature after 2000 and are near or above 80\u00b0F. In contrast, the years before 2000 overnight dropped far below 80\u00b0F and even hit 70\u00b0F. I know that the Las Vegas is the middle of the desert and climate change has gotten way worse over the years, contributing to the chart's changes. \nI wonder if climate change is the sole reason for the rising temperatures in Las Vegas? Since Nevada is mostly desert, I wonder if the rest of the state is having similar temperature increases? From 2020-2024, has the temperature risen even more?\nThis impacts my community because climate change is a worldwide affect. I notice the drastic change in temperatures where I live and at this rate, it will only grow worse. The environment that surrounds everyone, including myself, is being extremely harmed which directly affects the way that we live every single day.\n\"A Risky Gamble: The Rise of Temperatures in Las Vegas\"",

For the overnight lows, there was a slow and steady rise between 1950 and 1980 until it started to spike significantly by the year 2000. From then on, it continued to increase for the next 20 years, with a total of +11 F from 1950-2020. The daily highs remained mostly constant, with a brief but noticeable dip sometime in the 1980s. From then on, It finally had an increase of +2 F from 1950-2020. Ultimately, the temperature rose in both areas and is likely to follow an upward trend into the 2020s. \n\n2. (What do you wonder?) I wonder what caused a brief decrease for both daily high and overnight low temperatures as the timeline approaches the 1980s. Did a major event or political change occur during this period? In addition, have the states or areas surrounding Las Vegas experience similar trends in temperature as a result of climate change? \n\n3. (Relation to Community) The steady increase in overnight low summer temperatures is a call to the ongoing trends of climate change, which affects a vast amount of communities worldwide, which brings health and environmental implications, such as the risk of heat-related illnesses, wildfires, and quality of life. As such, it is important to notice the changes in temperatures over time and address them. \n\n4. (Headline) Las Vegas Nights Ablaze: Daily Temperatures on the High Roller",

    "comment info": "In this graph noticed that the temperatures in Las Vegas during the summer have been increasing. The high temperatures has increased by 2 degrees and the low temperatures have also increased but by 11 degrees. This means that the days are getting hotter and the nights are not getting as cool. There was a big drop in temperatures a couple years after 1980, but it went back up. The overnight temperature has risen much more drastically than the daily temperatures. I wonder why this is? Could it be the difference isn't actually as large since the daily temperatures is talking about the high and nightly temperatures are represented by the lows? This relates to my community because it shows that temperatures are increasing, and while I don't live in Las Vegas this graph is proof that temperatures are rising, so they are most likely rising everywhere based on the data. This is important to recognize so that a solution can be put in place to remedy the problem. I would title this graph \"Turn Up the Heat\" because it is showing the increase of temperatures.",

The red part of the graph is the high temperature levels, and they can go over 100 degrees many times. It is also shown that the high temperature was at a low in the mid 80's. next, the low of the graph is shown in a purple color, and the average low temperature is 70-80 degrees. i notice that the lowest it had been was 70 in the 70's, and the hottest it was for the lows has been recently.\nwhat do i wonder - I wonder if the  average low temperature and high temperature have increased recently due to the state of global warming our earth is facing, and if some of these similar fluctuations have happened in the past. \nwhat's going on in the graph? - I think that the graph is being used to show the change in average temperatures, and how rapidly the temperatures are increasing in the past 10 years.",

In the graph, as well there are many peaks and dips in the graph, and when the daily highs peak, the daily low also peaks, and vice-versa. Lastly, as the graph goes on, the distance in temperature, between the daily high and the daily low decreases, the gap between the two decreases in width.\n\n2.) Why does the width between the daily high and the daily low decrease as time goes on, and especially so after the year 2000? What causes the daily low temperatures to increase, while the daily high temperatures stay stagnant? Could energy consumption, or the location of where Las Vegas is, contribute to the temperature of the daily highs and daily lows of Las Vegas?\n\n3.) New Jersey is a decently volatile state when it comes to the weather and temperature, especially Perth Amboy, which is right next to the coast, meaning that it is more influenced by the ocean, and that also goes for the temperature, and recently it's been feeling hotter in New Jersey for much longer, so this could concern my community as what if it doesn't get colder, or what if it does but for much less time.\n\n4.)

Additionally, I may have an answer to one of your questions!\n\nWhen we are talking about comparing temperatures between Vegas and Texas, it may seem unclear as to why Vegas would be so much hotter, however, I believe that one major contributor to its high temperatures comes from the fact that it is what is considered an \u201cUrban Heat Island\u201d this \u201cHeat Island\u201d is mostly caused by rapid urbanization and development, leading to heat becoming, in a sense, trapped within the city because it doesn't have many places it can escape through.",

For example, I live in Florida, and here, rather than it getting cooler at night, OUR heat, remains pretty consistent (except in wintertime of course) and as such, I am always getting asked how we handle it, however, for vegas and california, it is a more unique situation. Their air is FAR Drier than anything we have here in florida, as such, the heat that is experienced during the daylight hours does not remain for long after the sun sets. In science heat tends to want to hold on to water which is also why hurricanes become so much stronger when warm water is present (i.e. the caribbean chain of islands). However, because this dry air is present, it offers a much better chance for tolerable conditions and also offers a much easier transition especially if the family is coming from a country or state that already had drier weather. Additionally, It's definitely helpful to keep a water bottle or sunshade umbrella handy during the day!",

I wonder why the midnight temperature took such a strong approach higher, whereas the daylight temperature took a more gradual approach to its climb in temperature.  I also wonder what led to the numerous noticeable variations in temperature over the years, both during the day and at night.  Finally, this graph only displays summertime temperatures, so I wonder what the yearlong temperature graph would look like.  Most likely pretty awesome\n\n3.

I also wonder if there is a certain reason that this graph is specifically focusing on Las Vegas, is it because it has had the most significant temperature increase? This relates to my community because as global warming rises, it affects the environment that I live in and that affects the way that I live my life. \nHeadline: Las Vegas Heat: The Rise of Temperatures Throughout the Years",

I also notice that while the nighttime temperatures are increasingly rising, there is a spike downward in temperature just after the start of the 2020s.\n\n2.  I wonder why the nighttime temperature took such a sharp approach upward, while the daytime temperature took a more relaxed approach to its rise in temperature.  I also wonder what caused the many obvious jumps in temperature throughout the various years, for both the nighttime and daytime temperatures.  Finally, this graph only displays summertime temperatures, so I wonder what the yearly temperature graph would look like.  Probably pretty cool.\n\n3.  While I don't live in Las Vegas, this temperature differentiation could very well be observed in locations across the continental USA, including that of my home region.  I have noticed some very peculiar weather patterns throughout this last summer, but my state is known for that.

It's easier to tell where the highs hover around than the lows because the lows are getting hotter and hotter with little to no dips in temperature. The highs and lows in Las Vegas have dips before but the highs have more noticeable dips  during the early 1980s so I wonder what caused the highs and lows to take such a dip during the early 80s.

There was also another big drop in daily lows around the late 1970s, which doesn't match the rest of the trends in the graph. I wonder if this specific instance is because of global warming, or if the Las Vegas area is doing something more that is impacting the temperatures of the area.\n\nThis relates to my community as an example of the effects of climate change and global warming on changing temperatures.

Daily highs in Las Vegas are above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and the overnight lows seem to be above 70. The lowest temperature was 70\u2109 in the 1950s overnight, while the lowest it was during the day was in the 1980s and 2000s when both were slightly below 100\u2109, but after that, as the years went on, the daily temperatures kept increasing along with the overnight temperatures. It doesn't seem like it will be going down anytime soon. \n2. I wonder if this has to do with the geographical location of Texas, it\u2019s one of the closest states to South America where temperatures are around 86 degrees Fahrenheit or above. I also wonder if Texas does not have temperatures as low as 60\u2109 because of the global warming phenomenon.
