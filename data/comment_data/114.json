One of the things I find interesting about the data is that the majority of the cities with the highest murders cleared are very populated cities. This can be due to the fact that they have plenty of funding for their police and other public services. The places with the lowest rates of cleared murderers were usually rural cities so it makes sense how when the population is so far spread out it takes time for the emergency services to reach the location.

As I mentioned earlier, not every data point is labeled and I wonder if the cities are chosen by random, population or some other method. \n3.  Luckily Hawaii is not a place where violence is particularly common, especially gun violence. I believe that gun ownership hovers around 12-15% usually. Just out of interest with some quick research I put together a quick data point for Hawaii and found that in 2019 we had 32 homicides, 20 of which were solved giving us 62.5% of murders cleared. We had 62 gun related deaths in 2019 with around 66% being suicide and 23% being homicides (the other 11% probably being hunting related). Eventually we get 63% murders solved and about 43% of homicides with guns.https://efsgv.org/state/hawaii/https://projectcoldcase.org/cold-case-homicide-stats/",

These can be seen, for example, in New York, which has a lower percentage of crimes committed with guns (less than 60%) but with more than 80% of crimes solved. While in cities where there are more gun crimes, such as Gary, Ind., with more than 90% of murders with guns, they have less than 20% of murders cleared.\n\nNow, what factors could be influencing the likelihood of a gun murder being solved or not? This New York Times article likely wants to point to the controversial issue of gun laws in the United States, with variations in each state and many hidden conflicts of interest.\n\nOne of the main consequences of the poor gun restrictions is the impossibility of knowing who has access to guns, who owns them, and even if that person is physically and psychologically able to own a firearm. However, just a few months ago, Texas approved buying and carrying a gun without a license. While many applauded the fact, this evidence of graphics and data ends up being terrible news for this region. Guns make it challenging to solve a crime.\n\nFinally, we can only hope that the government and the different states can reevaluate the gun control laws and come up with a solution that seeks the general welfare, not the profit of the gun industry in the country.",

Rather, these cities were the ones that met that \"30 or more murders\" criteria. \n\nI'm also curious about whether or not you had seen the article prior to your post.

I'm curious how you took from it that the NYT is trying to sway public opinion into removing guns out of the community because no claims were actually being made yet (unless you went and found/read the article; I haven't yet) - it seems to me maybe you personally drew that conclusion and are trying to ignore or resist it.",

To start, in cities with a larger percentage of murders done with guns, not as many murders were solved as those done without guns. This leads me to believe that murders done with guns are harder to solve, which can make these cities much more dangerous than cities with murders done without guns. While looking at this graph, I wonder how many murders were committed in each city each year on the graph. This would allow me to be able to understand which cities are safer regardless of murders done with or without guns. I also wonder which cities on the graph have more gun control. This would help readers understand how gun control can affect the crime rate in different cities. This relates to me because I have always wondered how the ownership and use of guns can affect crime in different cities. This can relate to my community because in America, many different citizens continuously argue about the use of guns. This allows people to have a better understand of how they affect society when used in the wrong way. In this graph, we see how murders committed with guns affect there chance of being solved.

There is a misconception that gun control laws are an attempt to get rid of guns entirely. However, these gun control laws are still allowing those who want to purchase a gun purchase one just with more certification. Owning a gun does not mean one intends to use it for murder. These gun control laws help filter out the misusers from the people seeking protection from obtaining their license. Even if someone who has a gun license has plans on using it for murder, it will be much easier to close the case as the gun will be traced back to them.",

I think this is because the type of combat that involves guns, in a sense, is not hand-to-hand combat. When people fire a gun it is something that is used from a distance. I wonder what kind of action the police force is taking because this is a problem. Innocent lives are being taken and the families of these victims don't even have the chance to know who caused their family pain. I also wonder what the government is doing about it. For the past few years now, the topic of gun restriction has been huge in America. Many groups of society believe that guns should be banned and I wonder if this topic of unsolved murders comes into the discussion. I also noticed that there are points on the graph that are not labeled and so I wonder what type of role they play in the graph. The town of Gary, Indiana has approximately 95% of murders that happen with guns. Out of this 95%, only about 5% were cleared. Maybe in smaller towns, it is harder to uncover crimes.

    "comment info": "It does look like there may be an inverse relationship, but there is so much spread that it is hard to tell. This is partly because the population size is so big so that there is more room for variation. I think it's very interesting that the bigger counties are on the upper left hand of the graph. For example, Sacramento and New York, which have budgets of tens of billions of dollars. On the lower right side of the graph, we can see smaller counties like DeKalb and Gary, which have significantly lower budgets. This may confound the study because more prestigious detectives could be attracted to larger cities for larger salaries. Or cities with higher budgets could afford better detectives. I wonder how the data was collected and how long that took. I would be very interested to know the r value, or correlation, between the two variables to see how strong the relationship is. A residual plot would also showcase the relationship better. It is also interesting to note that the x-axis begins the scale at 50%, making the graph seem more extreme. This topic greatly interested me because homicide rates are rising quickly in Mesa, the city where I live. A headline I came up with is: Are Gun Murders Harder to Solve?",

You just might be onto something when you mentioned police budgets being bigger for some cities/counties than others and what that might bring to the table of solving murders.  I did a quick check to discover the yearly budgets for Sacramento and New York just to see how close your estimates were.  Sacramento specifically proposed a 166 million dollar budget while NYC is between 5 and 6 billion dollars.  Los Angeles on the other hand is between 11 and 12 billion dollars.  Please come back tomorrow for the Reveal to read about resources available to police.\n\nDo you have an estimate for what the correlation (r) value would be for this graph?\n\nA residual plot would reveal if the data follows more of a linear model vs. a non-linear model.  \n\nGood eye on the scaling of the graph!  Why do you think the graph has the scaling that it does?\n\nMesa, AZ is near to Phoenix which is located on the graph.  It's just not labeled on the graph.  You can find Phoenix at approximately (74, 63) on the graph.

I would like to know the r value. I would like to see the residual plot. I also wonder as to how this applies to cities with lower murder rates.\n\nThis pertains to virtually everyone because murder clearance rates appear to be noticeably reduced when there are higher rates of gun murders, and clearing murders is helpful when it comes to putting the perpetrators in prison; something most people appreciate rather greatly.\n\nThe rates of gun murders and murders cleared in cities with high murder rates are being compared.

Even though it is spread out more evenly it is clear to me that there's kind of a 50/50 chance that you'll get caught just judging off of the graph. But in each case it's slightly different, we don't know if the body was hidden or disposed of, there are still people who just havent been found after getting murdered which could influence the graph alot. What I'm wondering is if there were any people not included on the graph, are there any missing people? It would most likely relate to the community if there was a sudden spike of crime in my community or other places. I would think if crime is happening in other places it would start fear and people might think of different ways to protect themselves. Which eventually might lead to no guns at all because of safety concerns. A head line could be: Murders and their weapons",

I wonder how many of those places have gun laws especially in places that fall in the top 90%-100%. Is gun control a problem in any of these cities? How do these numbers on either axis correlate with how safe these cities are?\nQ3. I think this relates to my community with a recent gun crime making the news.

This one made the news because even though we knew what had happened to some degree, the officers were not going to go to trial at first.

Chicago is almost on the trend line, with just under 60% of the murders solved. The graph demonstrates that gun murders are harder to solve, but ignores the far more important fact that gun control doesn't prevent gun violence. Someone might look at this graph and think, \"In order to solve more cases, we need less gun murders, so we need less guns, and therefore we need stricter gun control.\" However, when you notice that cities like Chicago with strict gun laws still have high violent crime rates, it is apparent that stricter gun control is not the solution. One of the leading predictors of violent crime is rates of fatherless homes. Statistics show that in general, a 10 percent increase in fatherless kids results in a 17 percent increase in juvenile crime. Therefore, while the New York Times implies that less guns mean more solved crimes, and therefore safer cities, guns aren't the problem. The problems are societal. The question shouldn't be \"What are the most common weapons in murders?\", because people will always find another way to kill each other. The question should be \"What can we as a society do to increase the numbers of fathers in homes?\" We need to address why people commit murders, and not how.  It is more important to prevent murders than to solve them.",

I wonder if all the murders that were cleared I would like to know if they were found guilty or not, I also wonder how many of the murders were caused by single shot and multiple shot and also I wonder at what point in the city these murder took place because with location I could more easily connect with the murder.\n\n3. Around 80 of them were cleared which means that they were solved or came down to a decision that put someone away or they could say that the case was solved.\n\n4. What is going on in this graph it is showing us in cities that had 30 or more murders which ones that were caused by guns were cleared or solved. It shows us what percentage in each city on which murder cases caused by guns were solved or cleared. Also, as you move down the x axis the more murder with guns the less it is able to be cleared which is why it also has negative correlation.\n\n\u00a05.

It appears that many of these communities listed are from the western part of the United States. I realize there are some from other parts of the United States but a majority are from the western party of the country. I also noticed that these towns are big cities, some of the biggest most known cities in the United States. \nWhat do you wonder? \nI am wondering why these cities are named? I am completely sure there are more cities but I would like to know why just these? I have read this article and it has not given me any information about how these cities were chosen.

I say this because as mentioned earlier western states and bigger cities are mainly represented in this graph. I am from a small midwest town. I feel like my community would not be on this graph.

I also think the more developed and populated cities, the more likely to solve the case because the resources and efficiency are much higher than less developed and crowded cities. However, I cannot agree with the fact of having more guns cause less efficiency in solving cases because if the city is highly sensitive to gun use and trading, it can tag on all the sales even though there is a large number of supplies.

This relates to my community because it shows that it is pretty safe around here and that we have safe and secure gun laws. An alternate title for this is, \"Guns are greatly affecting many murders\".",
