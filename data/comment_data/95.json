Given that, I would think it likely that of the say 30-40% of the population that does not want to be vaccinated, those under age 50 could get the infection, but might likely survive, while those who are unvaccinated and over the age 50 would continue to make up a greater proportion of deaths.

Ever since the start of it all, the public has been left with lingering questions upon when life will become normal again. The reveal helped me understand many parts of the article more clearly. At first, I was unaware of the difference that threshold immunity had compared to vaccine immunity. Many people, mostly between Democrats and Republicans, argued over the act of removing masks and what it could bring our country. I was unaware that threshold immunity is much more harmful than immunity formed by vaccines. It is only after a person receives both shots of the vaccines when they are announced fully vaccinated. This ultimately slows down the whole process of distributing vaccines, making it take much longer to reach the longed for threshold. After reading more information within the article, I also saw how total immunity includes the estimated number of those who contracted the virus and recovered from it. Even with the total immunity reaching its threshold in every chart, the deaths that will simultaneously occur are always much higher. This creates an inquiry for researchers of which plan is the most efficient way to take on the virus without too much hurt to the public.",

What Is The Right Call?\nOnce I reviewed the graphs detailed in this article, I noticed how obvious it is that Graph B is the most feasible and secure solution in order to reach the wanted herd immunity. Saying this, is this even an achievable plan? Even with President Biden's vision of having every adult in the United States vaccinated by May, many states lifted mask rules which could possibly set us back. Then again, is this act perhaps a step in a positive direction? Many debates are forming around this topic and the answer is unclear whether or not this risky move was beneficial. With disregard to the newly mask-less states, I can still see Biden's goal upon vaccines being reached. Teens, the most populated group of virus spreaders, are a huge factor to our goals. The vaccines are unable to cater to anyone under 16, leaving a vast portion of teens without the ability to get one. Even people the age of 16 who are eligible for the vaccine still have questions about it's safety. Will there be significant side effects that could possibly scare away many teens from receiving the vaccine? There are many concerns that I have, especially with Graph B and how it shows 90,000 casualties occurring if we are to reach immunity. It's also known in Graph D how unenlightened the United States is due to the possibility of new contagious variants springing up out of nowhere. How will scientists become aware of a new variant once it reaches us?",

Summer is nearing us and so are beach parties, creating a perfect setting for Covid-19 to thrive. Wilmington is known for being a common home for tourists during our Summers so the influx of tourists from states without masks could be harmful. This could potentially shut down North Carolina this summer if the spread becomes too out of control. Other North Western states will likely not have to deal with this possibility. If a decline like this was to happen again, schools would noy be the only areas impacted this Summer. Beaches could be closed along with restaurants, hurting our community even more due to all of the \u201cmask-free\u201d visirots. The decision to live by these seemingly necessary rules is a very poor decision in my eyes. Even when a state has low infection numbers, it's hard to manage travelers once Summer is here.",

The graph reveal also showed graphs with even more vaccinations, to accelerate herd immunity even more, which is something I hadn\u2019t previously considered(more than the 3 million in graph B). The huge vaccine increase pushes the total immunity up one month and the vaccine immunity up two months. It would also decrease the deaths by 10,000. Ending all social distancing precautions now would push the immunity timeline forward, but it would multiply the deaths by a little more than three. It is a very high-risk scenario and I do not think it\u2019s the best option, especially when there are safer routes that have a closer timeline. Even easing up on the precautions in the spring could result in lots more unnecessary deaths. I wish that we could end all precautions now, however I know that is not the right path. We could have our lives back to normal now, but hundreds of thousands of people would be killed. The best option is to increase the vaccines as much as we can realistically and keep safety measures in place. If we can just hold out for a little longer the end could be very soon.",

We also can't force them to get the vaccine, so what is it that we can do? Hope they get COVID and quickly recover? Hope they don't get COVID at all and don't become immune? The vaccine and precautions can only help so much but I guarantee that those precautions won't be in place forever. Once they're taken down and anti-vaxxers are free to do as they please, it's only a matter of time until they become exposed and COVID begins to spread once again.",

I Just basically talked about that the whole time not really looking at the other graphs.

The reason why \u2018C\u2019 could potentially work is because people would like the idea of not wearing a mask as much. Even though graph \u2018C\u2019 will take longer by a month it will still not force the public to rush into getting their shots, like graph \u2018B\u2019.

What Is The Right Call?\n\nAfter studying these four graphs closely, it is clear to see that Graph B is the safest and fastest solution to reach the ideal threshold. However, how practical is this scenario? Although President Biden has made a promise to have every U.S. adult vaccinated by the end of May, states such as Texas, Mississippi, Iowa, Montana, and North Dakota have lifted mask restrictions with their states. Is this a move in the right or wrong direction? Is this the light at the end of a dark tunnel or a move taken too soon? At the current rate, vaccines are being distributed, I do believe Biden will uphold his promise. But the next concern is teenagers, argued the biggest group of spreaders for the virus. Testing is happening to ensure teens over the age of sixteen are able to receive the vaccine safely, but how long might this take? How many parents will allow their children to become vaccinated if it has potentially side effects? My biggest concern with the charts in the uncertainty. Graph B states that we could reach the herd immunity threshold by May, but in that time, 90,000 people could die. There is no way of knowing whether more contagious variants as displayed in graph D should be a concern or whether we are immune to all strains once vaccinated.",

With the upcoming summer in only a few months, my biggest concern is whether or not the beaches will be a massive hotspot for COVID spreading. With the endless income of tourists to our beaches in North Carolina, our state and others highly affected by tourism could potentially have the worst of it, shutting down our communities while tourists return to their \u201cmask-free\u201d towns. While states such as North Carolina are inclined to shut down again in the midst of summer, less popular states like North Dakota and Iowa are more likely to stay open. This affects schools from opening five days a week, small businesses staying afloat, and most importantly the elderly or those with health conditions from contracting the deadly virus. I believe decisions on lifting restrictions must be made very cautiously depending on the state\u2019s infection and death rate, and also must be made to change easily and quickly if COVID cases start to rise.",

I also noted that the immunity totals could very possibly be less than indicated because I know people who have had it twice. I failed to really analyze the other graphs and compare them to each other. Originally, I didn't even notice that the vaccine threshold is never reached in the variant scenario(Graph D).\n\nAfter reading the reveal, I see that the graphs represent not only vaccine immunity, meaning the number of people who have been fully vaccinated, but also a total immunity including both vaccinated and those recovered from Covid-19. Each graph predicts when the immunity threshold will be met in four different circumstances. The first graph (Graph A) predicts that we will reach total immunity in July, and vaccine immunity in November if the country continues to handle the virus as it currently is, keeping restrictions and a steady vaccine rollout. This model predicts that 100,000 people could die from the virus before the herd immunity threshold is met in July. Graph B shows a prediction that we will reach total immunity in May, and the vaccine immunity threshold in July if we stay the same other than nearly doubling the vaccine rollout, from 1.7 million to 3 million shots per day.

Graph C shows that if we continue with 1.7 million shots a day, but ease up on restrictions regarding gathering, masks, and distancing, we will reach the threshold for total immunity in June and vaccine immunity in October. The earlier time of total immunity is the result of more people contracting the virus, which brings a higher amount of people recovering, but also a much higher death count of 170,000. While immunity does come faster, it is not worth how many extra deaths occur in the process. Graph D shows the possible outcome in the event of new variants, those that have wreaked havoc on other parts of the world due to their increased contagion rate. It predicts that we could reach the total immunity by July, but vaccine immunity is unknown due to the unpredictability of new variants and their resilience to the vaccine. The death prediction is a devastating 200,000 before the threshold is met, twice that of the same scenario without variants. Obviously, this is not a good outcome because so many people die, and immunity is indefinite. This virus is unpredictable and it could stray far from these predictions, or follow one of the other graphs not presented in the article.",

It looks at the number of people who have been fully vaccinated and combines that with an estimate of the number of people who have been infected and have recovered to measure total immunity. \"Measures like wearing masks and social distancing have proven to be effective in slowing the spread of the virus. As more people get vaccinated, it\u2019s tempting to ease up on those precautions.\" I think some places will end the mask mandate sooner, like Florida. But they are actually doing very well",

I notice that the only graph that isn\u2019t reaching the threshold is the supply of vaccines for public precautions.

Easing up on public precautions increases the number of deaths and lengthens the time to reach herd immunity (40 % to 70%). An increase in vaccine supply shows to be the most effective in reaching herd immunity sooner and preventing more deaths.\nWhat I wonder about these graphs is that will we reach the goal sooner if more people are being vaccinated, or will it take longer for us to reach the goal with all of these states ending their restrictions. \n This graph can impact my community because these graphs can encourage people in my city to get the vaccine so we can meet our goal and then be able to stop the restrictions once enough people are vaccinated.\nThese graphs are showing us different routes to take to achieve herd immunity, I would call it \"Covid and the way out\"",

Not only does it save the most amount of people from dying, but it\u2019s in the most timely manner. However, I don\u2019t think the US is capable of following such a direct plan of action, because many citizens find it against their right to wear masks or even be vaccinated. With such refusals against COVID safety procedures and the denial of proven science, I doubt we could get so many people to oblige to Graph B\u2019s plan. This also leads into why I think 3 million shots a day would be impossible, so 1.7 million is more reasonable, but it\u2019s sad to say that I\u2019m not certain if we could even gather that number of people everyday. Graph C seems to kill almost twice the amount of people from Graph b, and it only takes one month longer. The main reason for it\u2019s drastic increase in casualties is because public precautions are mildly lifted, while in Graph B we can see that no precautions are being lifted. This very idea would be more favored by most Americans, for they have grown to crave normacay and to risk not social distancing or wearing masks, or even being tested and quarantining.",

A scary aspect of possible leanince in our safety precautions, is if there was a sudden outbreak in an even more deadly verison of the virus, as shown in the contagious variant graphs.

In theory, it would save more lives, however, I am skeptical of the government being able to vaccinate mass population efficiently.  It appears that many states are prepared to lift restrictions as those that already have. I think the majority of Americans have grown tired of the mask mandate as well as the restrictions on gatherings.  I feel as though many people would prefer option C, however, we must consider those who have underlying health conditions.  If there was certainty that the vaccination would be effective against each variant of COVID-19, then Graph D would be a possibility, although there are no guarantees. If the vaccines show that they are not working on each variant then they will probably slow the production of the vaccine. This would mean delays in reaching  herd immunity. Although graph A would eventually work, It would most likely take longer for everyone to either become immune or get vaccinated. One downfall to all of these plans is that the vaccines in question are not FDA approved, presently they are just approved for emergency use. This shows the government is unclear as to  the long term effects these vaccinations could have on people. The lack of proven data and uncertainty surrounding the vaccination have many Americans opting out of vaccination.",

It should be an easy answer to choose protecting others, but with the mental toll that this virus has caused it has people craving for things to be normal. If we choose plan B we will continue to live our current lifestyle which will be frustrating, but it will also save lives. The chances of us being able to successfully achieve plan B are slim. People have a tendency to do what benefits them rather than others so we will most likely end up leaning more towards plans D or C. We all should make an attempt to come together and in turn stop the virus, save lives, and get us back on our feet as fast as possible.",

        "comment info": "After reading more about the graphs I have a better understanding of what they mean. With so many factors that go into stopping this pandemic it is certain that there is going to be a large number of deaths. First off we can see in graph A that maintaining our current pace isn\u2019t a bad option, but if we performed graph B and gave more shots everyday we would be able to reach herd immunity by May. There are also two options that would create more havoc, graph C and D. Graph C would allow us to lessen up on restrictions before we hit herd immunity which would cause us to have a massive surge in deaths and cases. Graph D would also cause problems because if variants of the virus are created and we don\u2019t have an adequate way to deal with them the situation will just get worse. Both option C and D will push back progression and force us to reach herd immunity way longer than if we all worked together and tried to complete graph B. The threshold of reaching graph immunity is between 70 and 90 percent. A big factor of how fast we reach this is how many vaccinations are given everyday. At our current pace(graph A) 100,00 will die and herd immunity will be reached in July.  If we increased the amount of shots to 3 million we could reach herd immunity by May and 90,000  could die. If we were somehow able to increase our output to 5 million shots we would reach herd immunity in April and 80,00 could die. If we want to save as many lives we need to increase shots and go with graph B.",

Ideally, our goal as a collective, should be 3 million shots per day as shown in graph B. However, the main problem is that these goals may be too unrealistic and may not align with our current situation given the presence of variants. Because of the new rise to potential COVID variants, graphs A or C may be a more realistic outcome. To prevent further COVID deaths in the recuperation period, it is important to administer as many vaccines to the public as possible.",

I am drawn toward graphs A and B, particularly because they seem the best and the soonest immunity reached. Graph B is the best case scenario but it will be hard to reach that because vaccine supplies are hard to increase. Graph A seems more realistic and is my guess for the future. I believe that we should do everything in our power to end this whole thing as soon as possible and take every precaution to do so. I personally dislike online school and am ready to get back to learning face to face so gaining herd immunity before my Junior year would be great.

I say this because we would ease up on precautions (graph C) and but supply vaccinations at a higher speed (graph B).

We were also shown a new graph that was even better than Graph B where we can reach herd immunity by April and still have 10k less deaths. This requires 5 million shots a day however and I don't see this happening. All the scenarios weren't great however, the two worst scenarios were one with 320k deaths and one with 530k deaths. Both of these scenarios only happen however if we end precautions now. I think that this shows further  evidence about how if we end the precautions now then it would be worse for our future.

Although some people believe we should end restrictions or at least ease up that would create 70,000 more lives lost but we would have herd vaccination a month earlier, in June. There is one situation where the virus contagiousness increases and this is our worst case scenario. It would cause an extra 100,000 lives lost although we'd still be achieving herd immunity by July.

Also when looking at these graphs I notice that if we stop using precautions, and stop worrying about state regulations we never get to the heard Immunity goal or it takes a lot longer to reach that goal. What I wonder about these graphs is that will we reach the goal sooner if more people are being vaccinated, or will it take longer for us to reach the goal with all of these states ending their restrictions. This graph can impact my community because these graphs can encourage people in my city to get the vaccine so we can meet our goal and then be able to stop the restrictions once enough people are vaccinated. A catchy head line for these graphs could be following regulations and getting the vaccine will help you get into a new routine.",

We\u2019d reach herd immunity by May, and vaccine immunity by July. But truthfully, I am not sure how possible this is. With states that have as large of a population as Texas reopening in a crucial part of the pandemic, I highly doubt we will reach herd immunity before the summer. I think Graph C will closely model what actually happens. As I mentioned before, when states like Texas open up and get rid of mask mandates, in no way does that put us, as a country, anywhere closer to overcoming the pandemic. \n\n\tI am also not sure of how spring break will affect these graphs. In Graph C\u2019s scenario, lifting restrictions along with the massive influx of college kids to Florida (which has never had a mask mandate) is a recipe for disaster. It raises a few questions in my mind. Will we see a spike around the first week in April? Or, in some miraculous turn of events, will people stay at home? How quickly can we bounce back from the inevitable spike in cases/deaths due to people vacationing for spring break?",

While \"herd Immunity\" starts with just 70% of the population, we are only at approximately 40% immune (as a population). Looking at this chart, it makes sense that \"vaccine immunity\" will reach that 70% mark later than \"total immunity\" would because every day people are developing covid antibodies, and this line includes vaccinations. What's been consistent with each graph is the fact that the new mandates for the virus will most likely end this year, in 2021, with the earliest \"total Immunity\" being May, and the latest being July. I've also noticed that in each chart, the \"total immunity\" line levels off just above 80% immune, which makes sense because not everyone in the US will be exposed to covid to not everyone can be immune to covid. Whats's interesting to me is that there are only four graphs. I would like to depict and see the other possibilities to compare and contrast the \"total Immunity\" rate, the death rate, and the vaccines per day rate. I think these are the most important \"numbers\" throughout all these charts, and they tell us what the timeline will be, and how successful the scenario will be when it comes to making out with everyone alive.",

This pandemic hasn't hit me and my family as hard as most, but I'm worried that some standard practices that we use to do before covid will stop altogether. \n\nComparing these graphs, I noticed that the \"best-case scenario\" graph is graph 2, with minimum deaths (90,000), earlier herd immunity for \"total immunity\" (May), and earlier herd immunity for \"vaccine immunity\" (July). The change that we have so see to accomplish what this graph says is to increase our vaccine shots per day from 1.7 million (which is what we are at right now) to 3 million. Without any unforeseen roadblocks and variants, this task seems possible. The graph that seems like a \"worst-case scenario\" is Graph 4. This has the most deaths (200,000) and predicts that we will not reach herd immunity with vaccinations. I feel like this graph is more realistic because it includes more variants of the covid virus. Graphs 1 and 3 are also hitting high death rates, at 100,000 and 170,000, and have later herd immunity for vaccinations.

In the spring there would probably be some precautions with social distancing still but we could reach herd immunity by June. We just have to last a little longer with the same restrictions then hopefully by the summer things will ease up. After comparing graph B with other scenarios it is truly the best way to reach herd immunity. In the other graphs, we never reach the herd immunity threshold. Graph B shows the least amount of deaths and the shortest time frame. I know we all want to get past Covid-19 but we have to be in it a little longer. Graph B is the only one that shows we reach both thresholds for herd immunity by the summer. All the other graphs show us reaching both thresholds by November which is just too far away. We should defiantly go with the Graph B plan with an increase in vaccines, public precautions, and no variants.",

I don\u2019t enjoy the graphical representation, but there's not a much better way to do it. I do enjoy how it shows the projected time that we will reach herd immunity. According to the graph, if we keep pumping out vaccines, and there are no coronavirus variants, and we keep the precautions in place, it\u2019s the most ideal situation, where 90k people will die, but we will be immune by may. That would be amazing. \n\n\nI wonder if these graphs are really true. Trends change all the time and don\u2019t follow data every time. The data is probably not 100% accurate, which sucks, but whatever. Also, we don\u2019t know that if you catch coronavirus, you are truly immune. So we should definitely try to stick to the vaccine at the moment, and see where that gets us. Additionally, I believe that we should try to ease up the lockdown even when we allegedly hit \u201cherd immunity.\u201d\n\nThe impact this has on our community is amazing. The more vaccines we pump out, the better. We\u2019re pumping out so many vaccines at the moment that I think we\u2019ll hit herd immunity around July. But that\u2019s just my opinion.

Honestly, Graph B represents an ideal situation, but based on recent news of different communities lifting certain restrictions and the current efficiency of vaccine distribution I believe that Graph C is more accurate to what our reality will look like.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI wonder how long herd immunity will be sufficient.

Also, with the spikes in typical travel times coming soon, I wonder how those will affect the graphs.\n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nIn my community, it is pretty split between reluctant, anti-maskers and people that take the virus seriously, so I think the higher the vaccination rate, the better for everyone (duh).

And like me, they also don't know the answers to questions such as how long the vaccines will be effective / how long the antibodies remain after infection. Something that I did not consider was that easing up restrictions could point to earlier herd immunity, but could also increase the probability of a mutated strand that would set us back to square one.\nThe ideal situation is if vaccinations are severely increased. This results in the quickest total and herd immunities while also having the lowest death rate. On the other hand, with increased vaccinations there will be more temptation to lift restrictions. By lifting restrictions, the time until vaccine immunity is not altered very much, but the total immunity suffers greatly. There is also a bigger chance for mutations and increased death rates. So all in all, it is best to increase vaccinations while keeping measures in place. Unfortunately, this is not realistic. The more likely situation involves a steady or slightly increased vaccine dosage with safety measures either kept in place or loosened.",

Although to keep death rates low we should be increasing vaccine output but also making restrictions even stricter to completely ensure that the vaccine is working and running its course because I have seen death reports of people that went out so often no one knows if the vaccine harmed them or if it was something else. Based on the graphs we should be increasing vaccines to 3 million shots per day and not ending restrictions until some time after April so we could avoid a lot more people dying. \nWhat I wonder- Is this vaccine truly effective? Vaccines take years and years to make yet this one was created in a matter of a year it's not that I am not grateful for the possibility of an end to this madness but the possibility this vaccine is harmful is truly scary. \nImpact- This impacts me and my community because since a lot of vaccine recipients are experiencing immunity soon things could semi go back to normal and the community can run as a whole again. \nWhat's going on?

Personally, I do not like the idea of that so I believe restrictions should be kept avoiding the outcome of Graph C. Graphs A, C, and D would cause too many deaths and could take up until June or even July to reach full herd immunity.

That means they'll let just a few more people die in my community, or way more, like up to 4,000 North Carolinians.

Sports and extracurricular activities are limited, which can make in-person social interaction scarce. It would certainly be nice to ease up on precautions and get back to normal life more quickly as shown in Graph C, but if we did that, so many more people would die.

Increasing the rate that vaccines are being handed out seems to be the best course of action since the least amount of people are at risk and we will reach threshold immunity in May. There is of course the chance that a new variant of the virus will appear and that would definitely increase the amount of deaths as seen in the graphs. \nWhat I wonder: I wonder what would happen if we increase the amount of vaccines we give out daily to over 3 million. Would we reach herd immunity quicker with less deaths or would it end up being less efficient than just stopping at 3 million. I also wonder what would happen if we end restrictions now instead of in April. \nImpact: The potential risk of the virus has an impact on everyone in my community. I would want to make sure my community is at the least amount of risk so increasing the amount of vaccines given out daily would be good. We need to make sure everyone in the community is able to get the vaccine.\nHow can we get to herd immunity faster but with fewer people dying?\nI feel like the best plan of action to get to herd immunity faster with fewer deaths is by increasing the amount of vaccines sent out daily. If a newer variant does emerge then we may end up having to increase the amount of vaccines given out to above 3 million per day.\nTitle: The Path to Herd Immunity and What it Will Cost",

The graph I think is best for the nation's general welfare, is graph B.

As I look around town, I see large crowds of people huddled together, without masks or social distancing. Even with mask restrictions in place, COVID cases are still rising, and people don\u2019t even follow restrictions. I understand how people who are vaccinated may think they are immune to getting the virus, but they should still be masking up, for the sake of others and for themselves. If we lifted restrictions like Texas has, the impact of the virus would increase significantly, and the rate of vaccinations would not be able to restrain the virus from spreading. In the graphs, we see different ways we can reach herd immunity, but the question posed is how. I believe if we can increase vaccine supply, keep the same public restrictions in place, with everyone following them, and having no variants, we could very well reach herd immunity by June, assuming everyone is able to get fully vaccinated.

With more than half a million Americans dead from the pandemic, I think it should be a top priority to keep that number as low as possible. I also noticed how the conditions of each graph changed, and how that reflects what could happen in the near future. In states like Texas and Mississippi, where restrictions are being lifted, we may see results similar to graph C, which will lead to many more Americans dying. In my opinion, we should do our best to stay on a model reflected by graphs A and B. Graph B is the ideal situation, but current vaccine supplies are unlikely to support 3 million people a day. I also noticed how much steeper the orange dotted lines are in graphs C and D. It is important to notice these lines because they show the population that will be immune due to exposure and recovery. It is a very poor choice to lift restrictions at the moment, as our death toll could rise like graphs C and D, especially considering the new strains of the virus that could be more deadly or contagious. My biggest wonder from this graph is how people will respond to it. The governor of Texas would likely benefit from seeing this graph. I think he would respond negatively to it, as he would see what could happen to his population. I also wonder how the virus deniers might view the graph.

I think B is the best option, as it saves the most lives. The reveal supports this, saying, \u201cthe US would reach herd immunity earliest and the fewest people would die if more people are vaccinated sooner in the scenario depicted in Graph B.\u201d In the article that allows the simulation to be controlled, it can be seen that 5 million shots a day will both save more lives and get the nation to herd immunity faster. However, this many shots a day is too ambitious. The amount of shots directly correlates to the herd immunity date. The faster shots get into arms, the sooner the date comes. Similarly, the more infections that there are, the sooner we come to a herd immunity. However, the more infections that there are, the more deaths that there are. This is supported by graph C. I wrote things that match these claims in my original post. One aspect of the graph that I overlooked in my post was virus variations. As the virus spreads, it evolves and changes its chemical composition in order to be immune to antibodies and vaccines. Variations and new strains cause vaccines to be less effective, as they often cannot efficiently prevent all strains of the virus. Hopefully these variants are not spread to the United States, or anywhere else in the world. That would cause an increase in deaths and a later herd immunity threshold, as supported by graph D.",

To the people who are vaccinated at the time and are healthy, this should not worry them but for someone who has underlying illnesses or has not receive their vaccine yet, they are more at risk. But when you look at all the plans you cannot avoid the fact that people are going to die from 90,000 to 200,000 people. I wonder what will happen if there is another spike in cases. Will we have to back to lockdown? Will easing up in the spring possibly lead us to shutdown? This could impact me and my community greatly. All of these are potential solutions and if we choose the wrong one it could lead us to another lockdown and more importantly many people dying. Is it really worth going back to normal and gaining deaths rather than waiting and possibly avoiding these deaths. Now we will never be able to avoid people dying but we can prevent it by taking the best precautions to keep us safe. I know my town has many small businesses that could not undergo another shutdown. These businesses getting back on their feet the last thing they need is it be told they are shutting down again.

It is inevitable that people will die, but it is what we do until we reach herd immunity that will protect the pace. Even if most people are vaccinated, it would be in our best interest to keep public precautions enforced. Small businesses could definitely not undergo another shutdown. Until we reach herd immunity, our main focus should be getting as many people there as we can.",

    "comment info": "In the charts I observed, I noticed how Graph B is the most reasonable way to continue on with trying to reach herd immunity.  It has the least amount of people that would die from the virus, and it also shows us reaching total immunity in May. Another plus about this graph is how many vaccines will be given out each day. With three million shots given each day, it shows us ending this global pandemic very soon which is a very pleasing thought. One thing about these graphs that makes me wonder is how did they know how many people would die from each scenario? I'm sure they based it on how many covid deaths occur daily but sometimes I am not always willingly trusting everything the media says. Something that surprised me in Graph 1 was how we would still be letting 100,000 people die if we continued distributing vaccines and keeping the mandates in effect. I guess most of those deaths will be from elders or people who are traveling a lot around the globe. The impact of someday reaching herd immunity will greatly impact my community, due to how we will be able to gather just like before the virus started. It will be refreshing to not have to wear a mask anymore and I feel like people will be in better spirits as well. Activities based on getting our community together will hopefully happen more and this will help the many kids who have been dealing with online learning. Getting out of the house and helping our community is such an important thing that everyone should practice.",

Now knowing this it makes more sense as to why many more people would die if other more deadly strands came out and if we were to lift public precautions. An area I did predict correctly was graph B, with how many vaccines will be given out daily and that it would be the best possible outcome. One of the pros associated with speeding up vaccinations would be that vaccine immunity would be achieved quicker. Although, 100,00 people could possibly die from the virus, and even if we increased to five million shots per day 80,000 people could pass away. A pro dealing with lifting the precautions and masks would be that we could reach herd immunity in June which is the start of Summer. But in the worst case, 180,000 people could die, and that number is very steep compared to 80,000. In the end, it only depends on the lives that we can save so the best option would be speeding up the vaccinations. It has the least amount of people to die from the virus and as well as the quickest time to reach vaccine immunity. While lifting precautions would have us in herd immunity by July, it also is very dangerous due to how a stronger variant of the virus may come out. Another negative associated with this scenario is how long it would take to reach vaccine immunity.",

With everything there is always something that could happen or a wrong way things could go. So, how do the people know what to do? They don't. There are many unknowns as I previously stated but with what is known we can decide on some pretty major things. One big debate is the precautions being taken. Do we lift them? Do we keep them? There are many pros and cons to both sides of the debate. If we lift them more people die but we get faster herd immunity. If we don't lift them there is less death but longer time till we have immunity. With these very important things factoring in, many people wonder, what is the best way to go about this? As research continues we continue to find more and more things out about this life threatening sickness but people have questions like, Can we survive a very big summer without the precautions and will we have to shut down again? I believe there are benefits to every side but if we are going to take away the precautions we need to be very cautious and still be careful about the people around us and ourselves.",

It would make sense that the number of people who have recovered from the virus and have received the vaccine reaches the herd immunity range before the number of people who have been fully vaccinated, but this makes me wonder: how many people are going to suffer from the virus before we can all get vaccinated? We should take into consideration Graph B and how there is a smaller death toll when there is an increased vaccine supply. The last thing we should do is lift precautions, especially in spring when children are out of school and travel, because Graph C shows the largest spike in cases, other than Graph D, in which case, contagious variants are not anything we can change. If we keep precautionary measures while people are getting vaccinated, there will be less deaths during the total time it will take to get everyone fully vaccinated. Many people are also hesitant about getting the vaccine because of their thoughts on the virus, so how can we make sure that everyone that can get a vaccine, gets vaccinated? Another issue stands: children\u2019s vaccinations. Since the vaccines that are being distributed are only safe for children over a certain age (16), how will we reduce the spread of COVID in children who are not of age to get vaccinated? Will there ever be a safe and effective vaccination for children to get? PART 1",

(Third Block) As I assumed in my last comment, speeding up vaccinations, while keeping the same precautions in place, would create the most efficient way for us to reach herd immunity. Something I did not note, was the death toll, and even if we did manage to speed up vaccine distribution, the death toll would still be fairly high. Although if we boosted vaccine supply to 5 million shots per day, the death toll would be 80,000 and we would be able to reach total herd immunity by next month. If we take this and compare it to the rate of distribution now, 1.7 million shots per day, we would reach total herd immunity by July, in which 100,000 people could die before we reach herd immunity. \nAnother scenario is if we lift restrictions, which I predicted would create the largest spike in cases, and delay progress in reaching herd immunity. If we keep the same restrictions until most people are vaccinated, the death toll is at 100,000, and we meet herd immunity in July. Keep in mind these numbers and dates to if we completely lift restrictions. The death toll increases to 320,000, which is a 220% increase in the number of deaths, but we reach herd immunity in May. The number of deaths is not worth reaching herd immunity faster by lifting precautions. Like what I\u2019ve stated in my last comment, lifting precautions should be the last thing we do because although we may be reaching herd immunity faster, the lives of beautiful people are being lost.

With the current variant and precautions, the death toll stays at 100,000, and we reach total herd immunity by July, which is the best cast scenario. If a new variant were to be introduced, and assuming we keep the same precautions, we will be able to reach herd immunity in July, but the death toll doubles to 200,000. The worst case scenario is if we get rid of precautions and have more variants, in which 530,000 lives would be lost, but we would reach herd immunity by next month.

If we are fortunate enough to have this, we could reach herd immunity before summer, and the death toll would not be over 100,000.

I'll be real here but I wonder what will happen to the people that haven't contracted covid nor have they taken the vaccine will herd immunity affect them? From my knowledge Herd Immunity works for those that have taken the vaccine and those who have recovered from the virus but what about the clean people? What will happen to them? Do they have to take the vaccine mandatory? I also wonder about the people that have extreme allergies, how long do they have to wait until another safer dose of the vaccine is made? The impact this has within my community, from where I live currently, a lot of the teens and young adults that love going out and seeing their friends/family are managing to stay healthy, and if we keep this process going with the vaccines then these people can go out WITH PRECAUTIONS but with no other worries.

I wonder what would happen to the number of Covid infected and what the effects would be on our economy if we went into another lockdown. I also wonder how we can mold the other plans to try and follow plan Bs guidelines so we can achieve the least possible deaths. \n\nWhat impact does this have on you and your community?\nThese graphs show the impact it has on the community. If we choose the wrong plan then we would be back into lockdown with a worse number of people with the virus. Everyone in the community risks getting the virus every time they step out the door. Covid has also affected the mental side of our health too. \n\nWhat\u2019s going on in these graphs? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea.\nThese graphs show the estimated vaccine numbers and how it affects both the number of cases and what month we might have herd immunity. The graphs also show the estimated death toll that comes with the specific plan. \nA potential title for these graphs could be \"Hop on the train, we are heading towards immunity.\"",

For example, I was trying to figure out why lifting precautions might speed up herd immunity. And after reading, I realized that after lifting precautions, they expect many more to get covid. Getting Covid either leads to being immune and recovering or dying from it. So, either way, it would push us closer to herd immunity but cause more deaths along the way.\nAfter looking at the graphs again, I realized that there's a mixture of graphs that would be more efficient than the option I chose. In my opinion, I believe that combining graphs B and C would be the best option for our country. It would mean that the public precautions would slightly ease up while increasing the vaccine distribution tremendously. This would allow some to get immunity from getting Covid but keep this number under control. It would also allow most to get immunity from getting the vaccine. The combination of graphs is the most efficient way to get herd immunity in a timely fashion.",

Then the herd immunity threshold will be met much later.\n-  I wonder why Graph A and C are so similar. Their thresholds for July/November and June/October are around the same percentage.

This one is by far the worst, we would never reach vaccine immunity, only total immunity, we would also have double the amount of deaths as A. My main question is, does Graph B include those that are not approved to take the vaccine because if it doesn't then wouldn't there be a possibility of covid still being passed around within the younger ages, especially in schools? when it comes to community, on one hand, it would be amazing to get back to normalcy and to be able to open up things that we haven't been able to do.

Graph A is the most likely to happen if we continue to apply adequate public precautions. It represents our current pace of 1.7 million vaccines per day, and when looking at it I felt a sense of hope because I can finally see the finish line. But because the virus is unpredictable, there are other scenarios that can play out. In graph B, if the United States increased the distribution of vaccines to three million vaccines per day, we could reach herd immunity by May. Although this result would be fantastic, and the predicted death rate would reduce by 10,000, it is unlikely because we would have to nearly double our vaccine outtake.  In graph C, if restrictions were ended in April, the United States could reach herd immunity by June. Despite heard immunity being reached faster, we risk losing 70,000 more people without public precautions. This makes me wonder if we will wait until after herd immunity to end restrictions. Graph D represents predicted herd immunity with the added factor of disease variants. Diseases constantly evolve, so we can never be 100% accurate.

This makes sense because the total immunization accounts for the total number of people who have been vaccinated as well as the people who have recovered from the Coronavirus infection.  I also noticed that on Graph C, the one with the lifted restrictions beginning in the Spring, the total immunity threshold is reached faster than it is reached on any of the other graphs.  I assume that most of the total immunity for Graph C is coming from people who are recovering from the infection, considering that with lifted public precautions, the disease is more likely to spread.  I know that the graphs are showing herd immunity levels, which would include children and adults, but I wonder if they are factoring in the uncertainty of vaccinating children.  There is not a vaccine ready to be administered to children yet, and if the vaccine is proven to be unsafe for children, I wonder how the graph will be altered.  I also wonder which graph is the most likely path by which the immunization in the United States will occur.

I personally do not think that lifting restrictions would be the best plan because it would increase the infection-caused deaths and would cause more people to contract the virus.  Yes, we would reach the total immunity threshold faster, but we have to remember that the Coronavirus is no joke.  The virus can leave you hospitalized or possibly dead, and the recovery process is not very much fun either.

The graphs shown here give evidence that social distancing guidelines, masks, and vaccines will help prevent people from dying, and allow America to return to life as it was before the pandemic sooner. Graphs C shows that we cannot afford to start relaxing these guidelines, as they predict that if people ignore them, 170,000 people could die between now and June. I also notice that though there is a solution with the fewest deaths, each of these solutions predicts thousands of deaths regardless of the outcome. This makes me wonder if there was any way to prevent the deaths from reaching this high. I also wonder if this amount of death could have been avoided if we had handled the pandemic differently when it began.",

    "comment info": "\u201cHerd Immunity: Is it Coming Sooner or Later?\u201d\n\nOur group gathered a lot of information from these graphs. For one, in 3 out of the 4 scenarios, herd immunity would be reached by early summer or June/July. We also noticed that herd immunity is achieved when a little under 70% of the population is completely vaccinated and it is projected to happen over the summer according to the graphs. Even with easing some restrictions, we could reach herd immunity by June, but it means a lot more people will die. Lastly, by increasing the vaccine rollout from 1.7 million to 3 million shots per day, we could prevent 10,000 deaths. Our group wondered many things from these graphs, such as will the number of deaths start to decrease as many people are starting to get the vaccine. In addition, we wondered if our country increases the supply of vaccines, how would this affect us financially, and can we distribute more vaccines. The impact that this topic has on our community is that we have been dealing with COVID-19 for a year now and having herd immunity would be a big step into getting things back to normal. Also, it is a really big deal to get the vaccine to prevent more deaths and more people from getting sick. This graph also impacts our community because it shows how COVID-19 has greatly affected the world and how wearing a mask is important.",

    "comment info": "Based on the data from the four graphs, our group noticed how each potential scenario could have a major effect on deaths and reaching herd immunity. If the supply of vaccinations increases from 1.7 million shots per day to 3 million shots per day, we could reach herd immunity in May rather than June. COVID variants with the current supply of vaccines would result in more deaths compared to maintaining the current supply and lifting restrictions. Although total immunity is currently around 40 percent, the overall vaccine immunity is lower. Based on these findings, we wondered, if we increase vaccinations by almost double, why will the herd immunity threshold only be met a month earlier? Lastly, how will distributions nearly double almost immediately if graph B were to be implemented? The virus has had a major effect on our communities but also the world as a whole. The deaths caused by the virus as well as the subsequent shutdowns has had a negative effect on both the population as well as the economy. The various plans for vaccination and reopening can potentially affect how many more people are lost due to the virus and when businesses, schools, and many other important organizations can reopen.

When I combine all of the graphs, I find that the percentage of vaccine immunity must be on the verge of crossing the threshold, but in Graph D, vaccine immunity is already falling short, and more people are dying. The result does not seem to be the best.\n\nWhat do you wonder?\nI'm curious as to why the vaccine tolerance for graph D falls short of the required level.

That being said, at first glance, Graph B seems to provide the best course of action. It shows that we could reach herd immunity by May, the earliest of all the predicted months, and estimates the least amount of potential deaths (~90,000). However, looking closer at this graph, I wonder at its probability/reality. It says in order to achieve these results, we would have to increase the supply of vaccines to 3 million per day, immediately. That\u2019s nearly double what our current supply is (1.7 M), something that seems difficult to achieve promptly. As far as the impact these graphs and their trajectories have on my community and me, I\u2019d say that Graph A, our current proceedings, seems most beneficial and would be the one I\u2019d encourage us to stick with. I know everyone is anxious for things to return to normal, believe me, I am too, but when weighing the different aspects of each respective graph (timeframe, amount of potential deaths, the feasibility of actions), Graph A seems to provide the best balance.

    "comment info": "what I notice:\nI notice that the U.S will reach herd immunity the soonest and if the vaccine supply increases, which also means fewer casualties.  This is shown in graph B. It is also clear that if the varients become more contagious, more people will die in order to reach herd immunity, about 200,000. This is shown in graph D. In graph C there is a similar death count to graph D when if we ease up on precaution in the spring, about 30,000 less than D. Finally in graph A I see that there is a similar death count to graph B when we continue precautions, have no varients, and the vaccine supply stays the same, about 100,000 deaths; 10,000 more than in graph B.\n\nHow it makes me feel/what do I wonder:\nI wonder if we will actually reach herd immunity in the U.S. in July like the graphs shown or if this pandemic drag on much longer than expected. Will we be back in school full-time in August? The graphs show that the U.S. is slowly recovering from the virus, but the price is more death. The graphs make me hopeful for a future without this pandemic but also scare me because of how many more people will die in order to reach that threshold.",

Both graphs A and B are, at least in my opinion, the best choices of graphs. They have lower deaths than graphs C and D. However, while graph A finishes sooner than graph B, it has 10,000 more deaths. Graph B, on the other hand, has 10,000 fewer deaths than graph A, but it will be completed at a later date.\n\nThe impact that I believe that this will have on myself and my community is that it will vary, depending on the scenario chosen. Like I have stated earlier, graph A will take effect sooner than graph B, but with more casualties, and the opposite can be said of graph B. Graph B will take longer to have an effect, but it will have fewer deaths than graph A, that being our current scenario.\n\nFinally, a catchy title for the graphs would be \"The Race for Herd Immunity!\" I think that this is a good title because each graph represents when in each scenario that we would reach herd immunity and the advantages and drawbacks of each of the four choices that we will have.",

        "comment info": "@Ethan Bruins I noticed many things as I read the reveal. One thing that I noticed was when I compared my response to the reveal, I had a similar answer to what the best scenario would be. I said Graph B would be the best one, since it would have the least amount of deaths. I also said the both Graph C and D would not be good scenarios, since there would be too many deaths. However, I didn\u2019t know specifically what would be the consequences if we chose to go with Graph C or D. With Graph C, there would be more deaths, but we would reach herd immunity sooner. And Graph D is similar, but the amount of deaths could \u201cdouble, or even more,\u201d as stated by the text. Even though we\u2019d reach herd immunity sooner, the amount of deaths is just too much to make that scenario worthwhile. Which is why Graph B is the best option. Both my comment and the reveal say pretty much the same thing in this regard. However, the reveal has more information than my response. I didn\u2019t even realize how much worse the death toll would be in scenario C and D, with scenario D having the death toll double, maybe even triple or quadruple. I didn\u2019t even think that these predictions could have this drastic of an effect on the death toll in the coming months. I think that my response went over most of what the reveal was about, but just in less detail, while the reveal went over the topics that I was also trying to touch on, but in far greater detail and more in-depth.",

There's a high chance that at least another 100,000 people will die before we reach herd immunity. I also noticed that removing public precautions almost doubles the number of deaths. \nI wonder how much we would need to increase our vaccine numbers in order to follow graph B's range of deaths and immunity. Is it something we could be able to do? Is it possible that there's any other way to reach immunity without almost 100,000 people dying? Our current vaccine availability is promising but could we save 10,000 people by increasing vaccine production?\nThis all has a huge impact on everyone. We're all in danger of getting covid when we go out, and some people don't care. Knowing that you could get a deadly virus just by going to your friend's house or out of town for a weekend is quite stressful. Covid also has negative mental health effects on a lot of people. I've been constantly anxious about getting or spreading covid for a whole year now, and I know many people who feel the same. But the sad part is that we can't all comfort each other because that may put us at risk for infection.\nThese graphs are just showing the difference in vaccine and total immunity based on different factors.

The first graph shows the current situation where there are no variants and with the current number of vaccines the immunity threshold would be reached in July but in the meantime 100,000 people could die. The second graph illustrates the potential situation of an increase of 3 million vaccines always without variants you could reach the immunity threshold in May with 10,000 deaths. As for the third graph, it shows how with a loosening of the precautions during the spring and with the same dose of vaccines at this time we could reach the immunity threshold in June, however with 170,000 deaths. Finally, the last graph proposes a situation where variations of the virus increase with the same number of vaccines and taking into account public precautions. In this case, the immunity threshold would be reached in June but there would be twice the number of deaths compared to the current situation. In our opinion, the best option is illustrated in the second graph because we would reach faster the immunity threshold and less people would die.",
