We think this graph raises American egos because it shows America has the most 1st place medals by far. USA has more medals in gold, silver, and bronze. Ukraine has a higher placement than Norway, even though Norway has more gold medals.  We noticed that USA and China are the only countries that are solid colors on the graph. What are  there four axis'? \n\nWhat do the little circles on Britain and France represent? We saw that the USA and China have the same number of gold medals and that USA has more silver and bronze. Why does the graph have \"Only care about gold medals\" and how does it show this? We noticed that the gold medals are worth 20 times more than the silver medals. Each corner of the box for the countries have a different meaning. Smaller/less populated countries tend to value medals more equally compared to the USA and China. How could proportions of country size/population be included in this graph? We saw that the more red toned the country is the higher the ranking is. The countries are from all over the world and not one continent. We wonder why they limited the graph to only these countries, is there a significance to these countries?

I also noticed how the graph used color gradients for all countries except the U.S. and China, where a warmer, darker tone represented a closer position to first place. Cooler, lighter tones reflected a lower standing. As the ranking decreases, the complexity of their graph increases.\n\nI\u2019m curious about how the various countries perceive their Olympic achievements separately. Do they place more importance on winning gold, or do they honor all medals with equal pride? How does such a perception differ from country to country? \n\nThis connects with my own community, where many aspiring athletes dream of achieving similar success on a global stage. The Olympics have become not just a showcase of talent but a symbol of national pride, particularly for the United States, which continues to lead in the medal counts.\n\nGoing for Gold: Do Medals Really Matter?",

I found it interesting that China and the United States were both first and second all across the board, while others (such as Britain) were third place while counting all medals equally but seventh when only counting gold medals. The difference between China and Britain's gold medals is so significant, and it makes me wonder what puts China and America so far ahead. I wonder if there are specific aspects that make one country more likely to win medals than others. Because the US is first in medals in general, I wonder if there's something different about American athletes that gives them a leg up when it comes to the Olympics. Perhaps it's the size of the US population. I know personally how much people care about the Olympics here in America, so maybe that's an incentive. As an American, I enjoy seeing how well my country does in the Olympics, and it's great way of showing patriotism. Title: \"USA on top\"",

America came in first place at the Olympics, having 40 gold medals, 44 silver, and 42 bronze. I first noticed how America has the most metals compared to any other country, but they have tied with China in gold. Since gold is given to the team who came in first place, and China and America have tied in that category, I wonder if China and America actually tied when it comes to who should get first place due to the value of the metals, not just the number. This graph relates to my community because as an American we value each one of our athletes equally. Getting gold is very important, but as it is shown in the graph, so is getting silver and bronze. If the athletes didn't get silver or bronze metals, then the U.S. would have lost the Olympics, so I believe that Americans value each athlete, no matter which metal they place. \nTitle: Who Will Win the Metal: Value or Volume?",

However, while analyzing the graphs I see that the further down you go, the more discrepancies there are within them. For instance, the U.S. has the most medals overall, but is also tied with China for gold medals. Yet, China is ranked lower since they have less medals than the U.S. Using this knowledge, it appears that the graphs seem to emphasize the importance of the different medals. For example, Great Britain comes in 3rd place for most medals overall, but when taking only gold medals into account they bump down to 7th place. This remains truthful throughout the graph, letting the audience know that it is not just about the medals, but the overall value they have.\nI wonder if how we rank them affects how the athletes get compensation for the medals? Do countries value gold medals over silver or bronze due to the profit it may bring in? Does valuing the gold medal over silver or bronze diminish the hard work of the other athletes?\nThe way we value one athlete's accomplishments over the other relates to my community and country. In society, we recognize and value the athlete with the highest accomplishment, but that does not diminish the other awards as well. It is easy to get wrapped up in the numbers, being first overall, however that should not take away from someone who received second or lower.\n\"Who's on top of the pyramid: Gold, Silver, or Bronze?\"",

    "comment info": "After analyzing the graphs above, it becomes evident that the ranking of countries in the medal count can vary based on how the medals are valued. It's intriguing to observe how different countries' performances can shift based on the method of counting medals and assigning values to gold, silver, and bronze. For instance, nations that dominate in silver and bronze medals might experience significant shifts in their rankings depending on how much they prioritize gold medals. The United States consistently excels across all ranking criteria, whereas countries like Brazil witness substantial fluctuations in their positions based on the significance attributed to various medals. I wonder how countries prioritize their medal counts and whether it affects their overall Olympic strategies. This relates to me and my community as it shows that the value placed on different types of medals can significantly impact the final rankings of countries. Headline: \"Medal Count Madness\u201d",

Although the United States and China are tied for gold medals, the United States has significantly more silver and bronze medals than China.  I also notice the use of color to demonstrate the scale of 1st-25th or lower.  I wonder if the United States, China, Britain, and France are red or orange because they are closer to 1st, being \"warmer,\" while Jamaica is blue because it is farthest from 1st, or \"cooler.\"  I thought it was very interesting that they used colors to depict the colors and rankings of the Olympic medals won by each country.  This relates to me and my community because the United States came in first, and as a citizen of the United States, I am proud of the American Olympians who made this achievement possible.  I watched many of the athletes win their gold, silver, and bronze medals from home with my family and friends, and the Olympic milestones that were achieved in the 2024 games gave the United States and its citizens a sense of pride.

While looking at these graphs I noticed that China and the US are tied in gold medals but way different numbers in medal and bronze. It's kind of confusing how each place can have the same amount of gold medals but very different amounts of bronze and silver. I think this might be due to the different amount of people in the Olympics of each place.    \n2. I also noticed how because the US have more medals overall they are in first place.\n3. This goes along with smaller places as well. for example Kenya has four gold medals while Ukraine has three.

The graph illustrates the gradual shifts in rankings, with each country either climbing or slipping over time. If we were to give equal weight to bronze medals as we do to gold, the U.S. would still hold the top spot. However, doing so would allow several other nations would rise in the rankings. I also noticed how the graph used color gradients for all countries except the U.S. and China, where a warmer, darker tone represented a closer position to first place. Cooler, lighter tones reflected a lower standing. As the ranking decreases, the complexity of their graph increases.\n\nI\u2019m curious about how the various countries perceive their Olympic achievements separately. Do they place more importance on winning gold, or do they honor all medals with equal pride? How does such a perception differ from country to country? \n\nThis connects with my own community, where many aspiring athletes dream of achieving similar success on a global stage. The Olympics have become not just a showcase of talent but a symbol of national pride, particularly for the United States, which continues to lead in the medal counts.\n\nGoing for Gold: Do Medals Really Matter?",

The difference between China and Britain's gold medals is so significant, and it makes me wonder what puts China and America so far ahead. I wonder if there are specific aspects that make one country more likely to win medals than others. Because the US is first in medals in general, I wonder if there's something different about American athletes that gives them a leg up when it comes to the Olympics.

America came in first place at the Olympics, having 40 gold medals, 44 silver, and 42 bronze. I first noticed how America has the most metals compared to any other country, but they have tied with China in gold. Since gold is given to the team who came in first place, and China and America have tied in that category, I wonder if China and America actually tied when it comes to who should get first place due to the value of the metals, not just the number. This graph relates to my community because as an American we value each one of our athletes equally. Getting gold is very important, but as it is shown in the graph, so is getting silver and bronze. If the athletes didn't get silver or bronze metals, then the U.S. would have lost the Olympics, so I believe that Americans value each athlete, no matter which metal they place. \nTitle: Who Will Win the Metal: Value or Volume?",

However, while analyzing the graphs I see that the further down you go, the more discrepancies there are within them. For instance, the U.S. has the most medals overall, but is also tied with China for gold medals. Yet, China is ranked lower since they have less medals than the U.S. Using this knowledge, it appears that the graphs seem to emphasize the importance of the different medals. For example, Great Britain comes in 3rd place for most medals overall, but when taking only gold medals into account they bump down to 7th place. This remains truthful throughout the graph, letting the audience know that it is not just about the medals, but the overall value they have.\nI wonder if how we rank them affects how the athletes get compensation for the medals? Do countries value gold medals over silver or bronze due to the profit it may bring in? Does valuing the gold medal over silver or bronze diminish the hard work of the other athletes?\nThe way we value one athlete's accomplishments over the other relates to my community and country. In society, we recognize and value the athlete with the highest accomplishment, but that does not diminish the other awards as well. It is easy to get wrapped up in the numbers, being first overall, however that should not take away from someone who received second or lower.\n\"Who's on top of the pyramid: Gold, Silver, or Bronze?\"",

For example, China's graph is not accurately portrayed because although both China and the United States earned 40 gold medals, the top right corner of China's data is colored in a lighter shade of red than the top right corner of the United States' data. Additionally, all of China's factors are ranked in 2nd place, disregarding the total number of gold medals. Furthermore, this happens similarly to Italy and Germany's graphs.\n\nI observe that each region of a country's graph has at least one ranking depending on each of the factors. The different colors in each graph denote the value of a ranking. If a country has more than one ranking in a certain area, a line separates the boundary from two or more rankings.\n\n2.  I wonder why rankings from 25th and after are represented with the same color on the graph. For example, Norway's ranking for the category: silver medals are worth 20 times bronze medals, falls in 25th place towards the bottom half. This is denoted in blue. However, Norway's ranking for all medals of the same worth falls in 26th place represented with the same shade of blue.\n\n3.

The boxes show the worth of  the medals combined to see who won in terms of worth in medals and not just the number of gold. The darker the box is the more worth of medals that country has. A bronze medal should not be considered the same as gold when determining who won the olympics because the bronze whatever country won the gold is better, so they deserve to be worth more. For example, Britain got more bronze medals that China. This doesn't mean that Britain should automatically be scored differently because China had more medals of higher worth meaning they deserved to ranked higher.

I notice that the USA and China were tied with gold medals, but the US had more overall medals, so they were the official winner in medal count. Many of the smaller graphs also show the difference in medal rank that countries would have if the rankings were judged in different ways. For example, Great Britain could either be 3rd or 7th in the world because they came third in overall medals and 7th in only gold medals. I wonder what specific system of ranking each individual country uses to decide which countries accomplished the most in the Olympics.

I also notice some are 100% in their ranking while others like Norway and Jamaica are extremely ranged in the possible medal ranking. For example, America is 100% first place whereas Jamaica ranges from 33rd to 46th place. I wonder why France and Britain could both be 3rd place. I think the question of how much each medal place should be worth is what is going on in this graph. I think France should easily be 3rd place and not possibly tied with Britain. France has more gold medals and silver medals than Britain. Although Britain has more bronze medals I don't think it should outweigh the factors of the gold and silver medals. I think the gold medal should be 60% value, silver should be 30% value, and bronze should only be 10% value. This relates to my community because I know that a lot of people in my community are extremely involved and passionate about the Olympics. If America was not fairly represented, I know my community would be very upset about it which makes the importance of equal representation so important in other countries as well.",

Britain and Kenya appear to display clear, opposing results depending on the value of the medals. For example, if all medals were valued equally, this would be good news for Britain, but bad news for Kenya. It would put Britain in it's highest possible placing, but would put Kenya near it's worst placing. Another opposing situation occurs when valuing the gold medals the most. Britain places the worst it can, but Kenya, the best. This is because of the relations to the countries at similar rankings. Britain obtained many medals, although they were mostly bronze, which causes the opposition to Kenya. Kenya, although not winning many medals, has a higher ratio of gold medals. \n2. I wonder why one of the systems of ranking the medals is to multiply the value by numbers such as 1.5, 2, and 5 on a graph like this. The numbers could be simpler, but they are not. Is this to emphasize the difference of the values of the top three awards?\n3.

The graph shows each country's progress slowly making its way up or down in its place. If we were to measure only bronze just as gold the US would continue to be on top but other countries would move to a higher stance. All graphs except China and the US had a color variation based on how close they were to 1, the closer to 1 the darker/warmer tone of color was presented, and the farther, a cooler lighter tone. \n2. The graphs reflect how the country made its way to its place, and why the countries that didn't make it to the top 10 or 20 constantly struggled more than others to maintain their place. I believe this has something to do with countries that lack resources in sports, the socioeconomic status of the country, the compensation for winning a medal, and how aware a country's community is of the Olympic games and the impact it would have on an athlete and their country. \n3.

    "comment info": "What do you notice?:\n- I notice that the graphs' color base is similar to a rainbow, the less you place the lower your color is on a rainbow for example, the USA was first overall no matter the value of the medal so they are always going to be red (top of the rainbow), but a country like Jamaica didn't have many medals so their place varies on the value of the medal so they were dark blue (bottom of the rainbow). I also noticed the countries with more bronze and silver medals compared to gold, have more lines on their graph because of how much their place varies when the value of the medals changes (this theory is rocky when either the country has no gold medals or has double digit medals in all 3 places). Also, for example, Jamaica again says they place anywhere from 33rd to 46th but only show the 6 places (varies depending on the country) they mostly averaged in.\nWhat do you wonder?:\n- If the medals were all equal, would participants try less because first isn't as valuable as before?  \n-why choose those 10 countries to use as an example?\nHow does this relate to you and your community?:\n-this has no impact on my community or anyone I know.

However, China has less bronze and silver medals, thus remaining behind the US. \n-  France, despite having more gold medals, remains behind Britain, as Britain has more bronze medals, thus having a higher total count. This shows that silver and bronze medals are important factors in the rankings. With enough of them, they can overpower gold medals.\n- A similar case happens with Ukraine and Brazil. They may have the same amount of gold medals, but Brazil outnumbers Ukraine with more bronze and silver medals. \n\n2) What do you wonder?:\nWhat other factors may have contributed to the US having such a high amount of medals? \nWhy is the silver and bronze medal count lower with China and the other countries compared to the US? \n\n3) Relation to Community:\nAs competition remains high among the countries, many athletes across the USA may be compelled to compete in the olympics.

I wonder what countries would replace the third-ranked country if the method for counting medals switched. I also wonder if people would pay more attention to countries with numerous bronze medals but little to no gold medals if that happens.  Gold medals are the most valued, and therefore the most recognized for determining a country\u2019s skill, while bronze medals are valued more to show a country\u2019s potential to achieve gold. I also wonder about how to decipher Norway\u2019s and Jamaica\u2019s graphs. \n3) How does this relate to me and my community?

As for myself and my community, our country got a win over everybody else's countries, so that acts as a slight boost to our national morale.  But on the other hand, my mind goes to the idea of countries who don't really appreciate each other (for example : The USA and China) being pushed into even further odds from each other.  I'm not saying that the Olympics would cause the USA and China to go to war, but I can't see us metaphorically dunking on them helping to strengthen international ties in any sort of way.

This graph shows how countries are ranked based on their Olympic medal counts, with different values given to gold, silver, and bronze medals.

Countries like Britain and France are also ranked, but their positions change depending on how the medals are counted. I also noticed that as the ranking decreased, so did the colors. For example, the US, is a dark red, and China is still red, but it\u2019s much lighter than the US, and then gradually the colors begin to go down the color scale or the rainbow. I interpret the different places/numbers inside the boxes to be what place the country consistently placed in.\n2. I wonder why the U.S. focuses so much on gold medals compared to other countries.

I wonder how the ranking of the different countries will change over time and if one country will transcend above the rest. \n\n\nHow does this relate to you and your community?

This structure implies dominance from the United States, and creates the sense that we won by so much, when that may not have been the case. \n2. I wonder why there is so much variability in the countries scores on the bottom rung? It feels like there should be a standard indicating how much Medals are worth, so the outcome is more clear. I think this would add to the competitive nature of the Olympics and only fuel overall competition.\n3. For me and my community, I have seen a lot of pride in the United States's performance in the Olympics. It provides something to come together on when I feel we are at a time where the divide is emphasized rather than the unity of our people. Gathering around the television and watching our country compete helps us forget about differences, and show us what makes us a nation.\n4. \"Majority of Medals Mark the Monarchs\"",

This means that they had so many more medals that no matter the equations used or the worth of the individual medals, the two countries would remain on top. I wonder what equations they were doing to get the information for this graph? Were certain medals added to equal on other? Were they all worth something in a system of measurement? This relates to me and my community because we live in America and many people are really into the Olympics. The best title and or caption I can think of for this is \"Know your place: who really won the Olympics?\"",

Two variables and the solution determines the rank.  \n\nTake another look at the labels on the x- and y-axes.  What's the general equation used for these graphs?  \n\nNow, notice and wonder about these graphs.",

This relates to my community because a lot of people in my community watch the Olympics and can have opinions this. I would also be curious about if my country would move up or down depending on the way they count it. My catchy headline is are gold, silver, and bronze metals very different in value?",

Therefore, we are ranked no.1 either way if you rank us by medal count or by most gold medals. \n\nI wonder why there are countries that are ranked much lower than others instead of representing the top 10 countries instead. \n\nThis relates with me and my community since a diver from Wantagh went to the Olympics seeking a gold medal. This shows me how rare it is to get gold or any medal for yourself and the country. \n\nA catchy Headline that would capture the graph\u2019s main idea would be \u201cThe Countries and their Strong, Fast, and Winners.\"",
