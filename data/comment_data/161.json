From the graphs, overall, I notice that global warming has been around and increasing as time goes on. I already had basic knowledge prior to reading the article, but reading more in depth contributes to my understanding that if future generations don\u2019t step up and take part in conserving them planet, were doomed. I presume the motivation of the author adding the graphs was an act of persuasion to the readers to allow them to get a better perspective about the effects going on in the environment. My question for this article would be, if global warming is so important in today's ecological crisis\u2019, why is it not talked about in schools more?",

Although this year in 2023 it looks like this year's July is hotter than the other past years which helps show how real global warming is. If it keeps up at this rate each year all the ice will finish melting and water levels will get even higher, more than likely flooding coastal towns when all of the icebergs finish melting. The Graph is implying if we keep it up like this we will keep on getting new record temperatures each year.",

I believe that if we continue to emit carbon dioxide at the current rate of global warming, the world will become even hotter, and in the worst case scenario, humanity will no longer be able to live on the earth.\nUp until now, the government and coalitions have encouraged people to walk instead of using their cars or to turn on air conditioning immediately, but from now on, I think it is necessary to set a firm limit by law. As I wasn't aware that global warming had become so bad until I saw this graph, I believe that many people are unaware of the extent to which global warming is progressing, so we need to make people aware of the bad effects and encourage each person to have a sense of urgency. To encourage each person to have a sense of urgency, I think we can consider in detail the worst case scenario that could happen due to global warming, and search for the state of islands that are now gone or about to be gone due to global warming. Although few of today's adults may be thinking deeply about this because they will not be alive in 2050, I hope that they will think about their own children who will become adults in the future and take appropriate actions with a sense of crisis that the world in which their children will live may disappear. \nI believe it is now time to start action for our future.",

Despite collective efforts across the globe to combat climate change, there has been little significant progress. Years of initiatives and awareness have yielded limited success, highlighting the urgency for a new approach.\n\n2. It\u2019s increasingly evident that more radical policy adjustments and agreements are imperative. Propelling the production of electric vehicles over conventional fuel-based cars is a prime example of a shift that could markedly decrease pollution levels. Furthermore, harnessing renewable energy sources such as solar and biomass is a crucial step towards mitigating further environmental degradation.\n\n3. With the arrival of summer, the reliance on air conditioning becomes almost indispensable, fuelling a continuous cycle of energy use. Alarmingly, a growing trend amongst teenagers is a preference for indoor activities, which inadvertently promotes an unhealthy lifestyle. The need for transformative actions is more pressing than ever to avert the escalating climate crisis.",

On the other hand, less developed countries like Nigeria and Pakistan are predicted to have an increase in younger populations, which could be due to less educational and work opportunities for women. \n\n3) How does this relate to you and your community?\n(This can be challenging - so think hard and make a connection.) \n\nThis relates to my community because now, the average number of children per couple is two, whereas it used to be 3 or more in the 1970s.

Specifically, the global temperature remained consistently below 62 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the period spanning from 1979 to 2022.  This transition is discernible in the graphical representation, where the daily global temperature between 1979 and 2022 demonstrated a conspicuous convergence towards the pinnacle of 64 degrees Fahrenheit, presaging the subsequent ascent in 2023.\n2. Considering the subtle shifts evident in the graph, it prompts contemplation of whether a discernible correlation exists between this temperature trend and overarching environmental phenomena, notably climate change.\n3. This information holds relevance for our community by fostering awareness regarding the evolving global temperature dynamics. An instance of the climate's profound impact on New Jersey residents occurred earlier this year when Canadian wildfires casted their influence. The incident unfolded as smoke and pollutants were transported by prevailing wind patterns, subsequently impacting our air quality, and endangering all residents, particularly exacerbating health concerns among those grappling with respiratory ailments.\n4.

In the months leading up to summer, there had also been about a .3-degree increase compared to last year. Then in summer, the average temp jumped to a whole degree over 2022 and a record high since 1979.\n             \"Why did this happen?\" I wonder. One popular and common answer these days is global warming. With the increase in global warming, it'd make sense to see an increase in temperature. However, many also believe this may have something to do with the Wildfire in Canada.\n            The Canadian wildfire, left much of New York in smoke. Smoke that drifted as far down the coast as North Carolina. The date of the fire starting coincides very well with the prominent spike. And if its causing that much smoke, is it not plausible that it could cause the bump in air temperatures? \n        The only problem with this theory is that, their have been multiple wildfires and forest fires in the past and yet they dont seem to have shown any spikes. So why is this specific on so significant? It might be due to its timing being in the middle of summer. Whatever the reason may be, its very interesting that it happened.

The temperature in each year follows a similar path: a relatively low, cool temperature to start off the year,  a slow ascendance up into the hot, summer months, and an equally slow descendance down again, wrapping up the year and tying it into a neat little bow. 2023 starts off the year fairly normal. It begins the year with a temperature of around 56 degrees, same as the others. Then June hits, and temperatures soar to 62.5, the highest temperature recorded since before 1979, according to this graph. \n\nWhat comes next? It is impossible for me to believe that human activity had no impact on this sudden surge in heat, what else could cause such a catastrophic change in only a year?

Even in what is supposedly mid to late June of 2023, it reaches about the average peak of every other year, and eventually reaches an all time high once July comes around. Keeping this in mind, it makes me wonder the external factors the led to this spike, whether or not it had contributions or is completely natural. These questions may also lead to why graphs and data is important. We are able to see a distinct jump in temperature in surface air for 2023 compared to every other year, meaning there was an obvious change that had something to do with the rise. Should another year have followed a similar path, past or future, we can determine the cause based on what happened in 2023. \n\"Data indicates all time high in surface air temperature for 2023.\"",

Statistics, clearly demonstrate the temperature increased from the 1970s and early 2000s to 62.744 degrees Fahrenheit (17.08 degrees Celsius) in the year 2023,  creating history in regards to Earth's highest average global surface air temperature.\n2) Will these changes continue to intensify over the coming years, or have we achieved a peak and will commence to fall back down? \n3)The rise of high temperatures can be highly impactful, such as it plays a factor in causing people not to want to go outside, something I feel is very crucial primarily due to the limitations we have recently encountered and are in the motion of moving past due to COVID-19. \n4) WEATHER ALERT: Earth experiences its highest average global surface air temperature on record!!",

Why I say this is because it you look at the graph you first see that in 1979-2021, 42 years it stayed about the same and there were no major problems but once you get to 2022 you see that is was at a very high point from even the colder months to the hot months and still stayed very high in the later months that were the coldest. Then we get to the current year and it starts off normal but as the year goes on it shoots up like a rocket to about a degree higher that 2022 every month and who knows what this graph will look like at the end of the year. I really think that we need to try to prevent this before we ruin our world.\n     I was in Rock Hill, SC during July 17th when it reached its all time high and I noticed how to air was a little bit darker, sort of like a red-orange color just stuck in the air and I saw on my phone a WECT notification that said something along the lines of the air is not safe, and I started to panic, I thought to myself \u201cwhat is going to happen to me\u201d but my parents reassured me that it was nothing to worry about and it wasn't a dire situation. \n     One thing I wonder about this graph is how it can go up so fast in such a short amount of time.",

I can also infer that july/september are the hottest months of the year. I wonder why this year its been the hottest its ever been since 1979, and i wonder if its because of global warming, or if its just because of a random spike of heat. It relates to my community because the global surface temperature affects the temperature that it is outside. I think that this graph was made to show how the global surface air temperature is getting higher and higher until it got significantly high recently, thats why the year where the global surface air temperature is the second highest out of any year is also highlighted.

The obvious answer for this is seasons. July and August are in the summer. On the other hand, December and January are in the winter.

The 2023 line is in the mix of it up until summer where it then breaks free from the norm and then sets the record for the highest surface air temperature we've ever had. It shows some considerable distance from the 2022 line in the summertime, however, it follows it almost perfectly otherwise. You can easily infer as to why it has done this, that being climate change. The rising rates of temperature have been an issue that has been slowly over the years been getting worse and worse and if you indivdualized each line by its year my point would likely be proven. I wonder whether or not this will continue on into next, whether a new record is achieved or if it drops a little only to almost guaranteely to rise again. It is not a matter of if but when the record is broken again at the current state of things, with nowhere near enough effort being put in to fix the rising temperature and overall issues with climate.

    "comment info": "\"The dangerous climb of our temperatures.\"\nThe graph's gradual increase over time may not seem huge, however this past July 21st, the record was broken for the day with the highest surface air temperature. This leads to several questions arising such as, \"How can we prevent this?\", and \"Will these continue climbing?\" This has affected many people in my life, myself included. Although gradual, these increasing temperatures make it challenging to play outdoor sports, especially for me due to my history of getting heat stroke and passing out. This graph demonstrates the dangerous climb of Earth's temperatures. Even slight changes in temperature consistently will gradually build up and cause more problems with natural disasters, out climate, and even out daily life.",

    "comment info": "This graph shows how the heat has been slowly rising from 1979 till now. It also highlights the recent outliers in the graph that are heat spikes like the one on July 6th. However for a lot of 2023 we have been having these heat spikes that seem less like outliers when 2023 is looked at individually and it made me wonder if global warming will cause these \"heat spike outliers\" to become more common and if they will become an even larger leap from the norm. The scary thing about this graph is that I could not only tell that this summer has been the hottest in a long time but I could also feel it when I went outside. I'm part of my schools marching band and during summer practices the sun was beating down on us like it never had before. It was an unbearable heat. It almost feels like we are frogs with the water slowly heating until its too late. That's why I think a good title for this graph could be \"How Long Until We are Cooked?\"",

Then I realized that it was a personal issue because a couple of my older family members that are really important to me have health issues, which meant the air quality would be severely bad for there health. One thing I wish NYT could have changed about the graph is that they could continued the 2023 part of the line on the graph so we could see if it was just that day that the air quality was so bad, or if it was just this year.",

I wonder what the cause of the increasing trend is and if it will continue to peak. It is interesting to see that global warming is impacting us more each year, with the hottest day recorded in US history being July 3rd. The graph shows that the temperature has only been going. I wonder why the highest temperature is only approximately 63 degrees. Overall, the graph shows more heat, and warmer winters.",

    "comment info": "I notice that the graph, depicting daily global surface temperatures for every year since 1979, is a parabola. This confirms that the highest global temperatures (at the vertex) are usually experienced in the summer months-- roughly June through September. In the caption, I notice that on July 6th, 2023 the average global surface air temperature was the highest on record at 62.744 degrees Fahrenheit. I notice that there seems to be an increase in global temperatures between 2022 (gray line) and 2023 (orange line). This trend is most visible from June through July, where the difference reaches around .5 degrees Fahrenheit. Based on the evidence, I think that the graph reflects the negative effects of climate change.\n\nBecause climate change is largely driven by an increase in greenhouse gases, I wonder what percentage of the emissions are from large corporations? Factories are usually responsible for the massive amounts of pollution entering the environment. Although, citizens with polluting habits can also negatively affect the climate.\n\nThe graph depicts the increase of global temperatures from 1979-2023 due to climate change.\n\nThis relates to my community because rising global temperatures suggest that a concerted response is required. We must change our habits so that they are more sustainable and less polluting. Likewise, large corporations must adopt a more sustainable model to mitigate the effects of climate change.\n\nMy headline-- Toasty Projections: Try Not to Burn!",

You can also see on the left side of the graph the different temperatures, which based on the title of the graph, \"Daily global surface air temperatures for every year since 1979\" On the graph itself, we can see many lines. Most of these lines are light gray and go in mostly the same direction, labeled 1979-2021. There is also a dark gray line representing the year 2022, and an orange line representing the current year, 2023. \n\nI WONDER: I wonder why the months are out of order, because normally when you see a graph the months are in order based on the order of the year. \n\nWHAT I THINK IS GOING ON: I think that the orange line is orange because it represents the current year we are in. It is meant to stand out and is more relevant to those looking at the graph. It is trying to show that global surface air temperature this year is higher than any year in the past on this graph. I think this graph is meant for educational and informing purposes to those seeing it. \n\nHOW DOES THIS RELATE TO THE COMMUNITY: This graph relates to the community because it is meant to show to its viewers that the global surface air temperature is meant to increase. By displaying this, it can get people interested and involved, and maybe interest more people in becoming a part of a Climate Change institute like the one who created this graph. \n\nMy title is \"This Graph is on Fire\"",

I wonder why 2023 and 2022 have their own separate colors even when 1979-2021 overlap with 2023 and 2022. I wonder why in January 1979-2021 had higher surface temperature than July 17 2023. i wonder if the reason for such high increase in surface temperature is because of what humans are doing to the earth or it the earth doing this because they treat the earth badly/ without respect. this graph relates to the community because it caused the air quality to be so poor that people with breathing problems or other problems couldn't go outside or do anything.",

What does this tell you about temperatures in the recent past?\n\nWhy do you think 1979 \u2013 2021 average daily global temperatures overlap with 2023?

In the year of 2023, there was a peak temperature of a little over 62 degrees Fahrenheit. This year has also had one of the highest temperatures for every month so far. This tells us how bad global warming is becoming. Not only are the temperatures already so high, they are continuously rising and aren't stopping. I wonder \"what specific things have the greatest impact on global temperatures over the years?\" I know that humans are a huge contribution to this problem. We need to become more aware of the problems we cause, especially if bit effects the beautiful place we live on. Not only will the lands and oceans have negative impacts, but so will us people. \n\nI play soccer in the fall and spring. I train in the summer to get in shape for my seasons, but when the temperatures are so hot, it is hard for me to breathe. The air quality is highly affects by these temperatures, and it negatively affects me and others. If we continue to allow global warming to get worse and worse, pretty soon we won't be able to do the things we love, and function the way we can. We need to find ways to better this world and make it a priority.",

I think this is because way more people live in the northern hemisphere. \n\nI wonder why people debate and argue over temperatures rising around the world. More people cause for more housing and production, which means less room for wildlife that absorbs carbon. I don't think it's life threatening, it just makes sense that the earth is getting warmer with 8 billion people on it. \n\nIt relates to me and my community by making working conditions more difficult. If it's more dangerous to work outside because of the heat, workers may want a pay raise. On the other hand, companies wouldn't want to give them that raise if the heat is affecting the efficiency of their work. This causes conflict that could effect the economy.",

This year in particular there is the largest rise in temperature than in years prior. The graph shows that on July 17th of this year, it reaches over 62 degrees Fahrenheit, while in 2022 it shows that it just reaches 62 degrees. I wonder why there is this sudden rise in temperature. Is there something that we can do to help with this?\nThis rise in temperature has had so many effects in the last few weeks. The main effect would be all the thunderstorms that have happened due to an increase in temperature and humidity. These storms have caused powerlines and trees to fall down and that overall has affected my community. Finally, a catchy headline,  Could this have been the all-time hottest summer yet?",

The lightest gray lines show the trend of daily global surface temperatures from the year 1979-2021. Although there are a few outliers, overall, the daily temperatures in 2022 reached a higher peak than previous years. Currently in 2023, the daily global temperatures have surpassed those in 2022. Following the trend, one could predict that the daily global temperatures will decline at a slower rate than previous years.\nWhat are the main causes of the increase in global temperatures, and what is the global temperature trend projected to be for the rest of 2023? Why are global temperatures previous from 1979 not accounted for?  \nHistorically in my area, around the end of August and September, temperatures begin to cool, hitting as low as 50-60 degrees F.

Are you trying to indicate that the average global air temperature raising two degrees and reaching an all-time high, being recorded since 1979 that is, is not a serious issue for concern?",

Can you elaborate on that to me I am very interested as I have never heard of that before! I also wonder how they got this information from all around the world in 1979 because the technology was not very advanced. I mean there were certainly no iPhones where you could just go on it and check the weather every day. They may have gotten the information from new forecasts from back then because there were televisions. Or I am sure scientists were keeping records of it and those records were communicated to the people who created this line graph.",

If your notice makes a claim, where in the graph is the evidence to support your claim?\nI notice on July 6,2023 the Earth had its highest average global surface air temperature on record. This is displayed when we see for July 6,2023 the line spikes higher than all the other faded and old lines by quite a margine. \nWhat do you wonder?\nWhat happened on July 6, 2023 that caused this high temperature to be recorded?\nHow does this relate to you and your community?\nThis relates to me and my community because global warming is an issue for everyone across the world and if it was a global measurement that means it we have a data point from our area included in the data.\nWhat\u2019s going on in this graph? Create a catchy headline that captures the graph\u2019s main idea.    Global Surface Air Temperatures Reaches A Record High Average.",

The Northern Hemisphere temperature range is more extreme than the Southern -- historically between roughly 9 and 21 degrees C (48 to 70 F), whereas the Southern Hemisphere ranges from 11 to 17 degrees C (52 to  63 F). Am I correct in assuming this is due to the fact that two-thirds of the land mass on earth is in the Northern Hemisphere? (i.e., the larger ocean area working as more of a temperature \"buffer\"?) \n\nRegardless of the underlying reason, the differences in range between the hemispheres would explain why the graph isn't as flat as one would expect.",
