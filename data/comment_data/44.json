We can compare this global situation to the ice age, where the global temperature dramatically decreased. At that moment, if modern humans were alive then, Gretta Thunderburg would say it's the lack of gas emissions. People can make the argument that animals are dying off at an alarming rate, but that's the way the world works. The world lost many species during the ice age; evolution is impartial, some animals will evolve to counter this global heating, and some will die naturally.",

For example, in 2016 It was at the highest point but It went way down in 2017-2018.\n \n2) What did the author assume I already knew?\nThe author assumes that I already knew what the colors of the dot. That blue means cooler and red means hotter. They also assume we already knew the different years that weren't listed on the graph.\n \n3) What changed, challenged, or confirmed what I already knew?\nOn the graph, it said what the coolers mean so it confirmed what I already assume.\n \n4) What is going on in this graph and how do you know? \n\nI know that the graph mean how Rising Global Temperature\nChanges thou the years.

Another interesting thing about this graph is that the temperauture dips in the early 1900s and then begins to rise again. The temperature was highest in 2016, and has dropped since. I wonder why the temperatures dropped in the early 1900s, what has caused it to increase since, and what would have to be done to reverse the trend. The temperature also spiked in 1944, and I wonder what casue this.  One possible title for this graph is \"Things are Heating Up:Rising Yearly Temperatures.\"",

There is a spike around 1944, and the first quarter of the graph is fairly flat instead of having a positive association. Because of the positive association, it seems like the temperature will continue to rise. I wonder if world war two caused the spike around 1944, and if the graph will ever plateau like it did around 1880-1920.

The degrees are measured in Celsius, lining the vertical axis to the left of the graph, which might imply that this graph is heavily scientific because it uses the metric system. The use of color in each temperature point is also an important part of the visual, with white and blue colors representing lower temperatures, and pink and red colors representing higher ones. The overall trend, represented by the fluctuating colored points on the graph, seems to be that over the years, temperatures have been hotter than the 1880-1899 average, which is represented by the line at zero degrees Celsius.

The scatterplot shows data from 1880 to 2018, and there are some data areas that strike me as unusual. For example, the global temperature was generally bouncing back and forth between being hotter than the 1880-1899 average and being colder than the average between 1880 and 1935. I also noticed there was seemingly a sudden spike in temperature starting in 1935, that peaked in 1944. These usual features lead me to be curious about what was going on in the world or the government at this time which may have led to this spike in global temperature, possibly the new industrialism that came with World War II? It is clear that in general, from 1950 until 2016, there has been a strong, positive, and linear association with temperature rise. Luckily, since 2016, the temperature has gone down slightly. This is most likely due to this publicity that global warming has received, and people are starting to take action. \n\nA catchy headline to capture this graph\u2019s main idea could be: Rise in Global Temperature: What Goes Up Must Come Back Down",

The rising of global temperatures and how much cooler or warmer it got every year with the average temperature of the late 19th century. I noticed that in the 1880s-1935 the temperature varied. It would range from hotter than the average to colder. As the years went on it would only go up. It seemed that from 1940s-2018 it was only hotter than the average temperature. From 1998-2018 the dots seem to be darker as well. I wonder what is causing the change in climate? Is it the advances in technology and the way we do things?

As of 2011 to 2016 the temperature didn't go down AT ALL.\n- I wonder why some people think us humans are doing global warming or climate change. Global warming or climate change  is NOT cause by us humans. It is something to do with the Earth and how it is positioned. Though we might have something to do with air quality which might effect how the sun is getting to the surface.\n-This graph shows that the temperatures vary and are sometimes low but sometimes high. The temperatures have been very high recently. If this were not assigned for school than this article would NOT catch my eye.

    "comment info": "I notice the rising trend in global temperature, and while the dots do vary from year to year, there has been a dramatic upward shift starting around the 1970s and continuing at a roughly even rate.  As for wondering, there are several speculations I have on this graph. I wonder why it peaked in the 40s for a little bit before going back down. My guess is that that was due to WWII. Using a ton of military equipment and mass transportation could have contributed to that but it may also have just been a well-timed variation.  I agree with Storm E.  I also wonder what the data looked like in previous years and if the climate has undergone such drastic changes before.  Having only a limited number of years to view could skew the data to fit one's perspective. Was there any bias when creating this graph? My last wondering: is there is anything that could be done to reverse the increasing trend, especially at an individual level? A worldwide council that would work towards fixing this trend seems highly unlikely and far too idealistic, given that many of our own country\u2019s politicians only seem to yell their opinions at each other. \nClimate Change Shows No Signs of Peaking is my headline.",

    "comment info": "I notice that the temperature data, represented by dots over time, show an increasing trend with variation from year to year. To see the pattern more clearly, I try to estimate a moving average of temperature from 10 consecutive years at a time and plot those average temperatures over time. This technique shows a smooth and clearly rising curve over time. I am curious about how the data looked in more distant past such as over the last 1000 years. I also wonder if we have already passed the point of no return as far as global warming is concerned.",

        "comment info": "@Storm E.  I agree with you. I would love to know where the plotted point would be ten years from now. Global warming is a serious issue and  i like it how you said the graph looks like a \"pattern\" because your kind of right. As the years increase it gets warmer and sometimes hits a high spike. I also like your last sentence \"I also wonder is we have already passed the point of no return as far as global warming is concerned.\" Because we never know when the end is near and global warming is a serious issue that there may not be a return from because we are so deep into it as the chart shows.",
